HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
AFTER	1
an	1
unequivocal	1
experience	1
of	1
the	1
inefficacy	1
of	1
the	1
subsisting	1
federal	1
government,	1
you	1
are	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
deliberate	1
on	1
a	1
new	1
Constitution	1
for	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
of	1
America.	1
The	1
subject	1
speaks	1
its	1
own	1
importance;	1
comprehending	1
in	1
its	1
consequences	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
UNION,	1
the	1
safety	1
and	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
composed,	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
an	1
empire	1
in	1
many	1
respects	1
the	1
most	1
interesting	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
frequently	1
remarked	1
that	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
reserved	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
this	1
country,	1
by	1
their	1
conduct	1
and	1
example,	1
to	1
decide	1
the	1
important	1
question,	1
whether	1
societies	1
of	1
men	1
are	1
really	1
capable	1
or	1
not	1
of	1
establishing	1
good	1
government	1
from	1
reflection	1
and	1
choice,	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
are	1
forever	1
destined	1
to	1
depend	1
for	1
their	1
political	1
constitutions	1
on	1
accident	1
and	1
force.	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
remark,	1
the	1
crisis	1
at	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
arrived	1
may	1
with	1
propriety	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
era	1
in	1
which	1
that	1
decision	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
made;	1
and	1
a	1
wrong	1
election	1
of	1
the	1
part	1
we	1
shall	1
act	1
may,	1
in	1
this	1
view,	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
the	1
general	1
misfortune	1
of	1
mankind.	1
This	1
idea	1
will	1
add	1
the	1
inducements	1
of	1
philanthropy	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
patriotism,	1
to	1
heighten	1
the	1
solicitude	1
which	1
all	1
considerate	1
and	1
good	1
men	1
must	1
feel	1
for	1
the	1
event.	1
Happy	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
if	1
our	1
choice	1
should	1
be	1
directed	1
by	1
a	1
judicious	1
estimate	1
of	1
our	1
true	1
interests,	1
unperplexed	1
and	1
unbiased	1
by	1
considerations	1
not	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
public	1
good.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
more	1
ardently	1
to	1
be	1
wished	1
than	1
seriously	1
to	1
be	1
expected.	1
The	1
plan	1
offered	1
to	1
our	1
deliberations	1
affects	1
too	1
many	1
particular	1
interests,	1
innovates	1
upon	1
too	1
many	1
local	1
institutions,	1
not	1
to	1
involve	1
in	1
its	1
discussion	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
objects	1
foreign	1
to	1
its	1
merits,	1
and	1
of	1
views,	1
passions	1
and	1
prejudices	1
little	1
favorable	1
to	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
truth.	1
Among	1
the	1
most	1
formidable	1
of	1
the	1
obstacles	1
which	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
encounter	1
may	1
readily	1
be	1
distinguished	1
the	1
obvious	1
interest	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
class	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
every	1
State	1
to	1
resist	1
all	1
changes	1
which	1
may	1
hazard	1
a	1
diminution	1
of	1
the	1
power,	1
emolument,	1
and	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
offices	1
they	1
hold	1
under	1
the	1
State	1
establishments;	1
and	1
the	1
perverted	1
ambition	1
of	1
another	1
class	1
of	1
men,	1
who	1
will	1
either	1
hope	1
to	1
aggrandize	1
themselves	1
by	1
the	1
confusions	1
of	1
their	1
country,	1
or	1
will	1
flatter	1
themselves	1
with	1
fairer	1
prospects	1
of	1
elevation	1
from	1
the	1
subdivision	1
of	1
the	1
empire	1
into	1
several	1
partial	1
confederacies	1
than	1
from	1
its	1
union	1
under	1
one	1
government.	1
It	1
is	1
not,	1
however,	1
my	1
design	1
to	1
dwell	1
upon	1
observations	1
of	1
this	1
nature.	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
disingenuous	1
to	1
resolve	1
indiscriminately	1
the	1
opposition	1
of	1
any	1
set	1
of	1
men	1
(merely	1
because	1
their	1
situations	1
might	1
subject	1
them	1
to	1
suspicion)	1
into	1
interested	1
or	1
ambitious	1
views.	1
Candor	1
will	1
oblige	1
us	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
even	1
such	1
men	1
may	1
be	1
actuated	1
by	1
upright	1
intentions;	1
and	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
doubted	1
that	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
opposition	1
which	1
has	1
made	1
its	1
appearance,	1
or	1
may	1
hereafter	1
make	1
its	1
appearance,	1
will	1
spring	1
from	1
sources,	1
blameless	1
at	1
least,	1
if	1
not	1
respectable--the	1
honest	1
errors	1
of	1
minds	1
led	1
astray	1
by	1
preconceived	1
jealousies	1
and	1
fears.	1
So	1
numerous	1
indeed	1
and	1
so	1
powerful	1
are	1
the	1
causes	1
which	1
serve	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
false	1
bias	1
to	1
the	1
judgment,	1
that	1
we,	1
upon	1
many	1
occasions,	1
see	1
wise	1
and	1
good	1
men	1
on	1
the	1
wrong	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
questions	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
magnitude	1
to	1
society.	1
This	1
circumstance,	1
if	1
duly	1
attended	1
to,	1
would	1
furnish	1
a	1
lesson	1
of	1
moderation	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
ever	1
so	1
much	1
persuaded	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
in	1
any	1
controversy.	1
And	1
a	1
further	1
reason	1
for	1
caution,	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
might	1
be	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
always	1
sure	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
advocate	1
the	1
truth	1
are	1
influenced	1
by	1
purer	1
principles	1
than	1
their	1
antagonists.	1
Ambition,	1
avarice,	1
personal	1
animosity,	1
party	1
opposition,	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
motives	1
not	1
more	1
laudable	1
than	1
these,	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
operate	1
as	1
well	1
upon	1
those	1
who	1
support	1
as	1
those	1
who	1
oppose	1
the	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
question.	1
Were	1
there	1
not	1
even	1
these	1
inducements	1
to	1
moderation,	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
ill-judged	1
than	1
that	1
intolerant	1
spirit	1
which	1
has,	1
at	1
all	1
times,	1
characterized	1
political	1
parties.	1
For	1
in	1
politics,	1
as	1
in	1
religion,	1
it	1
is	1
equally	1
absurd	1
to	1
aim	1
at	1
making	1
proselytes	1
by	1
fire	1
and	1
sword.	1
Heresies	1
in	1
either	1
can	1
rarely	1
be	1
cured	1
by	1
persecution.	1
And	1
yet,	1
however	1
just	1
these	1
sentiments	1
will	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
be,	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
sufficient	1
indications	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
happen	1
in	1
this	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
former	1
cases	1
of	1
great	1
national	1
discussion.	1
A	1
torrent	1
of	1
angry	1
and	1
malignant	1
passions	1
will	1
be	1
let	1
loose.	1
To	1
judge	1
from	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
opposite	1
parties,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
conclude	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
mutually	1
hope	1
to	1
evince	1
the	1
justness	1
of	1
their	1
opinions,	1
and	1
to	1
increase	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
their	1
converts	1
by	1
the	1
loudness	1
of	1
their	1
declamations	1
and	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
their	1
invectives.	1
An	1
enlightened	1
zeal	1
for	1
the	1
energy	1
and	1
efficiency	1
of	1
government	1
will	1
be	1
stigmatized	1
as	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
a	1
temper	1
fond	1
of	1
despotic	1
power	1
and	1
hostile	1
to	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
liberty.	1
An	1
over-scrupulous	1
jealousy	1
of	1
danger	1
to	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
which	1
is	1
more	1
commonly	1
the	1
fault	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
heart,	1
will	1
be	1
represented	1
as	1
mere	1
pretense	1
and	1
artifice,	1
the	1
stale	1
bait	1
for	1
popularity	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
good.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
forgotten,	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
that	1
jealousy	1
is	1
the	1
usual	1
concomitant	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
noble	1
enthusiasm	1
of	1
liberty	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
infected	1
with	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
narrow	1
and	1
illiberal	1
distrust.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
equally	1
forgotten	1
that	1
the	1
vigor	1
of	1
government	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
liberty;	1
that,	1
in	1
the	1
contemplation	1
of	1
a	1
sound	1
and	1
well-informed	1
judgment,	1
their	1
interest	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
separated;	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
dangerous	1
ambition	1
more	1
often	1
lurks	1
behind	1
the	1
specious	1
mask	1
of	1
zeal	1
for	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
than	1
under	1
the	1
forbidden	1
appearance	1
of	1
zeal	1
for	1
the	1
firmness	1
and	1
efficiency	1
of	1
government.	1
History	1
will	1
teach	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
former	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
a	1
much	1
more	1
certain	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
introduction	1
of	1
despotism	1
than	1
the	1
latter,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
overturned	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
republics,	1
the	1
greatest	1
number	1
have	1
begun	1
their	1
career	1
by	1
paying	1
an	1
obsequious	1
court	1
to	1
the	1
people;	1
commencing	1
demagogues,	1
and	1
ending	1
tyrants.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
observations,	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
an	1
eye,	1
my	1
fellow-citizens,	1
to	1
putting	1
you	1
upon	1
your	1
guard	1
against	1
all	1
attempts,	1
from	1
whatever	1
quarter,	1
to	1
influence	1
your	1
decision	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
moment	1
to	1
your	1
welfare,	1
by	1
any	1
impressions	1
other	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
may	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
truth.	1
You	1
will,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
have	1
collected	1
from	1
the	1
general	1
scope	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
they	1
proceed	1
from	1
a	1
source	1
not	1
unfriendly	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution.	1
Yes,	1
my	1
countrymen,	1
I	1
own	1
to	1
you	1
that,	1
after	1
having	1
given	1
it	1
an	1
attentive	1
consideration,	1
I	1
am	1
clearly	1
of	1
opinion	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
interest	1
to	1
adopt	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
safest	1
course	1
for	1
your	1
liberty,	1
your	1
dignity,	1
and	1
your	1
happiness.	1
I	1
affect	1
not	1
reserves	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
feel.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
amuse	1
you	1
with	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
deliberation	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
decided.	1
I	1
frankly	1
acknowledge	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
convictions,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
freely	1
lay	1
before	1
you	1
the	1
reasons	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
founded.	1
The	1
consciousness	1
of	1
good	1
intentions	1
disdains	1
ambiguity.	1
I	1
shall	1
not,	1
however,	1
multiply	1
professions	1
on	1
this	1
head.	1
My	1
motives	1
must	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
depository	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
breast.	1
My	1
arguments	1
will	1
be	1
open	1
to	1
all,	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
by	1
all.	1
They	1
shall	1
at	1
least	1
be	1
offered	1
in	1
a	1
spirit	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
disgrace	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
truth.	1
I	1
propose,	1
in	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
papers,	1
to	1
discuss	1
the	1
following	1
interesting	1
particulars:	1
THE	1
UTILITY	1
OF	1
THE	1
UNION	1
TO	1
YOUR	1
POLITICAL	1
PROSPERITY	1
THE	1
INSUFFICIENCY	1
OF	1
THE	1
PRESENT	1
CONFEDERATION	1
TO	1
PRESERVE	1
THAT	1
UNION	1
THE	1
NECESSITY	1
OF	1
A	1
GOVERNMENT	1
AT	1
LEAST	1
EQUALLY	1
ENERGETIC	1
WITH	1
THE	1
ONE	1
PROPOSED,	1
TO	1
THE	1
ATTAINMENT	1
OF	1
THIS	1
OBJECT	1
THE	1
CONFORMITY	1
OF	1
THE	1
PROPOSED	1
CONSTITUTION	1
TO	1
THE	1
TRUE	1
PRINCIPLES	1
OF	1
REPUBLICAN	1
GOVERNMENT	1
ITS	1
ANALOGY	1
TO	1
YOUR	1
OWN	1
STATE	1
CONSTITUTION	1
and	1
lastly,	1
THE	1
ADDITIONAL	1
SECURITY	1
WHICH	1
ITS	1
ADOPTION	1
WILL	1
AFFORD	1
TO	1
THE	1
PRESERVATION	1
OF	1
THAT	1
SPECIES	1
OF	1
GOVERNMENT,	1
TO	1
LIBERTY,	1
AND	1
TO	1
PROPERTY.	1
In	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
this	1
discussion	1
I	1
shall	1
endeavor	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
satisfactory	1
answer	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
objections	1
which	1
shall	1
have	1
made	1
their	1
appearance,	1
that	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
claim	1
to	1
your	1
attention.	1
It	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
thought	1
superfluous	1
to	1
offer	1
arguments	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1
utility	1
of	1
the	1
UNION,	1
a	1
point,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
deeply	1
engraved	1
on	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
every	1
State,	1
and	1
one,	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
imagined,	1
has	1
no	1
adversaries.	1
But	1
the	1
fact	1
is,	1
that	1
we	1
already	1
hear	1
it	1
whispered	1
in	1
the	1
private	1
circles	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
oppose	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution,	1
that	1
the	1
thirteen	1
States	1
are	1
of	1
too	1
great	1
extent	1
for	1
any	1
general	1
system,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
of	1
necessity	1
resort	1
to	1
separate	1
confederacies	1
of	1
distinct	1
portions	1
of	1
the	1
whole.1	1
This	1
doctrine	1
will,	1
in	1
all	1
probability,	1
be	1
gradually	1
propagated,	1
till	1
it	1
has	1
votaries	1
enough	1
to	1
countenance	1
an	1
open	1
avowal	1
of	1
it.	1
For	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
evident,	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
take	1
an	1
enlarged	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
subject,	1
than	1
the	1
alternative	1
of	1
an	1
adoption	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution	1
or	1
a	1
dismemberment	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
It	1
will	1
therefore	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
begin	1
by	1
examining	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
that	1
Union,	1
the	1
certain	1
evils,	1
and	1
the	1
probable	1
dangers,	1
to	1
which	1
every	1
State	1
will	1
be	1
exposed	1
from	1
its	1
dissolution.	1
This	1
shall	1
accordingly	1
constitute	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
my	1
next	1
address.	1
PUBLIUS.	1
1	1
The	1
same	1
idea,	1
tracing	1
the	1
arguments	1
to	1
their	1
consequences,	1
is	1
held	1
out	1
in	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
publications	1
against	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution.	1

To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
WHEN	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
reflect	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
now	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
decide	1
a	1
question,	1
which,	1
in	1
its	1
consequences,	1
must	1
prove	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
that	1
ever	1
engaged	1
their	1
attention,	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
their	1
taking	1
a	1
very	1
comprehensive,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
serious,	1
view	1
of	1
it,	1
will	1
be	1
evident.	1
Nothing	1
is	1
more	1
certain	1
than	1
the	1
indispensable	1
necessity	1
of	1
government,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
equally	1
undeniable,	1
that	1
whenever	1
and	1
however	1
it	1
is	1
instituted,	1
the	1
people	1
must	1
cede	1
to	1
it	1
some	1
of	1
their	1
natural	1
rights	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
vest	1
it	1
with	1
requisite	1
powers.	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
worthy	1
of	1
consideration	1
therefore,	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
conduce	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
that	1
they	1
should,	1
to	1
all	1
general	1
purposes,	1
be	1
one	1
nation,	1
under	1
one	1
federal	1
government,	1
or	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
divide	1
themselves	1
into	1
separate	1
confederacies,	1
and	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
each	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
powers	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
advised	1
to	1
place	1
in	1
one	1
national	1
government.	1
It	1
has	1
until	1
lately	1
been	1
a	1
received	1
and	1
uncontradicted	1
opinion	1
that	1
the	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
depended	1
on	1
their	1
continuing	1
firmly	1
united,	1
and	1
the	1
wishes,	1
prayers,	1
and	1
efforts	1
of	1
our	1
best	1
and	1
wisest	1
citizens	1
have	1
been	1
constantly	1
directed	1
to	1
that	1
object.	1
But	1
politicians	1
now	1
appear,	1
who	1
insist	1
that	1
this	1
opinion	1
is	1
erroneous,	1
and	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
looking	1
for	1
safety	1
and	1
happiness	1
in	1
union,	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
seek	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
into	1
distinct	1
confederacies	1
or	1
sovereignties.	1
However	1
extraordinary	1
this	1
new	1
doctrine	1
may	1
appear,	1
it	1
nevertheless	1
has	1
its	1
advocates;	1
and	1
certain	1
characters	1
who	1
were	1
much	1
opposed	1
to	1
it	1
formerly,	1
are	1
at	1
present	1
of	1
the	1
number.	1
Whatever	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
arguments	1
or	1
inducements	1
which	1
have	1
wrought	1
this	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
sentiments	1
and	1
declarations	1
of	1
these	1
gentlemen,	1
it	1
certainly	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large	1
to	1
adopt	1
these	1
new	1
political	1
tenets	1
without	1
being	1
fully	1
convinced	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
founded	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
sound	1
policy.	1
It	1
has	1
often	1
given	1
me	1
pleasure	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
independent	1
America	1
was	1
not	1
composed	1
of	1
detached	1
and	1
distant	1
territories,	1
but	1
that	1
one	1
connected,	1
fertile,	1
widespreading	1
country	1
was	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
our	1
western	1
sons	1
of	1
liberty.	1
Providence	1
has	1
in	1
a	1
particular	1
manner	1
blessed	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
soils	1
and	1
productions,	1
and	1
watered	1
it	1
with	1
innumerable	1
streams,	1
for	1
the	1
delight	1
and	1
accommodation	1
of	1
its	1
inhabitants.	1
A	1
succession	1
of	1
navigable	1
waters	1
forms	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
chain	1
round	1
its	1
borders,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
bind	1
it	1
together;	1
while	1
the	1
most	1
noble	1
rivers	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
running	1
at	1
convenient	1
distances,	1
present	1
them	1
with	1
highways	1
for	1
the	1
easy	1
communication	1
of	1
friendly	1
aids,	1
and	1
the	1
mutual	1
transportation	1
and	1
exchange	1
of	1
their	1
various	1
commodities.	1
With	1
equal	1
pleasure	1
I	1
have	1
as	1
often	1
taken	1
notice	1
that	1
Providence	1
has	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
give	1
this	1
one	1
connected	1
country	1
to	1
one	1
united	1
people--a	1
people	1
descended	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
ancestors,	1
speaking	1
the	1
same	1
language,	1
professing	1
the	1
same	1
religion,	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
principles	1
of	1
government,	1
very	1
similar	1
in	1
their	1
manners	1
and	1
customs,	1
and	1
who,	1
by	1
their	1
joint	1
counsels,	1
arms,	1
and	1
efforts,	1
fighting	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
throughout	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
bloody	1
war,	1
have	1
nobly	1
established	1
general	1
liberty	1
and	1
independence.	1
This	1
country	1
and	1
this	1
people	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
for	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
it	1
appears	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
Providence,	1
that	1
an	1
inheritance	1
so	1
proper	1
and	1
convenient	1
for	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
brethren,	1
united	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
by	1
the	1
strongest	1
ties,	1
should	1
never	1
be	1
split	1
into	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
unsocial,	1
jealous,	1
and	1
alien	1
sovereignties.	1
Similar	1
sentiments	1
have	1
hitherto	1
prevailed	1
among	1
all	1
orders	1
and	1
denominations	1
of	1
men	1
among	1
us.	1
To	1
all	1
general	1
purposes	1
we	1
have	1
uniformly	1
been	1
one	1
people	1
each	1
individual	1
citizen	1
everywhere	1
enjoying	1
the	1
same	1
national	1
rights,	1
privileges,	1
and	1
protection.	1
As	1
a	1
nation	1
we	1
have	1
made	1
peace	1
and	1
war;	1
as	1
a	1
nation	1
we	1
have	1
vanquished	1
our	1
common	1
enemies;	1
as	1
a	1
nation	1
we	1
have	1
formed	1
alliances,	1
and	1
made	1
treaties,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
various	1
compacts	1
and	1
conventions	1
with	1
foreign	1
states.	1
A	1
strong	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
value	1
and	1
blessings	1
of	1
union	1
induced	1
the	1
people,	1
at	1
a	1
very	1
early	1
period,	1
to	1
institute	1
a	1
federal	1
government	1
to	1
preserve	1
and	1
perpetuate	1
it.	1
They	1
formed	1
it	1
almost	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
political	1
existence;	1
nay,	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
their	1
habitations	1
were	1
in	1
flames,	1
when	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
citizens	1
were	1
bleeding,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
hostility	1
and	1
desolation	1
left	1
little	1
room	1
for	1
those	1
calm	1
and	1
mature	1
inquiries	1
and	1
reflections	1
which	1
must	1
ever	1
precede	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
wellbalanced	1
government	1
for	1
a	1
free	1
people.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
wondered	1
at,	1
that	1
a	1
government	1
instituted	1
in	1
times	1
so	1
inauspicious,	1
should	1
on	1
experiment	1
be	1
found	1
greatly	1
deficient	1
and	1
inadequate	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
it	1
was	1
intended	1
to	1
answer.	1
This	1
intelligent	1
people	1
perceived	1
and	1
regretted	1
these	1
defects.	1
Still	1
continuing	1
no	1
less	1
attached	1
to	1
union	1
than	1
enamored	1
of	1
liberty,	1
they	1
observed	1
the	1
danger	1
which	1
immediately	1
threatened	1
the	1
former	1
and	1
more	1
remotely	1
the	1
latter;	1
and	1
being	1
pursuaded	1
that	1
ample	1
security	1
for	1
both	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
a	1
national	1
government	1
more	1
wisely	1
framed,	1
they	1
as	1
with	1
one	1
voice,	1
convened	1
the	1
late	1
convention	1
at	1
Philadelphia,	1
to	1
take	1
that	1
important	1
subject	1
under	1
consideration.	1
This	1
convention	1
composed	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
possessed	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
whom	1
had	1
become	1
highly	1
distinguished	1
by	1
their	1
patriotism,	1
virtue	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
in	1
times	1
which	1
tried	1
the	1
minds	1
and	1
hearts	1
of	1
men,	1
undertook	1
the	1
arduous	1
task.	1
In	1
the	1
mild	1
season	1
of	1
peace,	1
with	1
minds	1
unoccupied	1
by	1
other	1
subjects,	1
they	1
passed	1
many	1
months	1
in	1
cool,	1
uninterrupted,	1
and	1
daily	1
consultation;	1
and	1
finally,	1
without	1
having	1
been	1
awed	1
by	1
power,	1
or	1
influenced	1
by	1
any	1
passions	1
except	1
love	1
for	1
their	1
country,	1
they	1
presented	1
and	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
plan	1
produced	1
by	1
their	1
joint	1
and	1
very	1
unanimous	1
councils.	1
Admit,	1
for	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
fact,	1
that	1
this	1
plan	1
is	1
only	1
RECOMMENDED,	1
not	1
imposed,	1
yet	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
remembered	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
neither	1
recommended	1
to	1
BLIND	1
approbation,	1
nor	1
to	1
BLIND	1
reprobation;	1
but	1
to	1
that	1
sedate	1
and	1
candid	1
consideration	1
which	1
the	1
magnitude	1
and	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
demand,	1
and	1
which	1
it	1
certainly	1
ought	1
to	1
receive.	1
But	1
this	1
(as	1
was	1
remarked	1
in	1
the	1
foregoing	1
number	1
of	1
this	1
paper)	1
is	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
wished	1
than	1
expected,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
considered	1
and	1
examined.	1
Experience	1
on	1
a	1
former	1
occasion	1
teaches	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
too	1
sanguine	1
in	1
such	1
hopes.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
forgotten	1
that	1
well-grounded	1
apprehensions	1
of	1
imminent	1
danger	1
induced	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
to	1
form	1
the	1
memorable	1
Congress	1
of	1
1774.	1
That	1
body	1
recommended	1
certain	1
measures	1
to	1
their	1
constituents,	1
and	1
the	1
event	1
proved	1
their	1
wisdom;	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
fresh	1
in	1
our	1
memories	1
how	1
soon	1
the	1
press	1
began	1
to	1
teem	1
with	1
pamphlets	1
and	1
weekly	1
papers	1
against	1
those	1
very	1
measures.	1
Not	1
only	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
government,	1
who	1
obeyed	1
the	1
dictates	1
of	1
personal	1
interest,	1
but	1
others,	1
from	1
a	1
mistaken	1
estimate	1
of	1
consequences,	1
or	1
the	1
undue	1
influence	1
of	1
former	1
attachments,	1
or	1
whose	1
ambition	1
aimed	1
at	1
objects	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
correspond	1
with	1
the	1
public	1
good,	1
were	1
indefatigable	1
in	1
their	1
efforts	1
to	1
pursuade	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
reject	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
that	1
patriotic	1
Congress.	1
Many,	1
indeed,	1
were	1
deceived	1
and	1
deluded,	1
but	1
the	1
great	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
reasoned	1
and	1
decided	1
judiciously;	1
and	1
happy	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
reflecting	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
so.	1
They	1
considered	1
that	1
the	1
Congress	1
was	1
composed	1
of	1
many	1
wise	1
and	1
experienced	1
men.	1
That,	1
being	1
convened	1
from	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
they	1
brought	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
communicated	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
useful	1
information.	1
That,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
passed	1
together	1
in	1
inquiring	1
into	1
and	1
discussing	1
the	1
true	1
interests	1
of	1
their	1
country,	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
acquired	1
very	1
accurate	1
knowledge	1
on	1
that	1
head.	1
That	1
they	1
were	1
individually	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
liberty	1
and	1
prosperity,	1
and	1
therefore	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
less	1
their	1
inclination	1
than	1
their	1
duty	1
to	1
recommend	1
only	1
such	1
measures	1
as,	1
after	1
the	1
most	1
mature	1
deliberation,	1
they	1
really	1
thought	1
prudent	1
and	1
advisable.	1
These	1
and	1
similar	1
considerations	1
then	1
induced	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
rely	1
greatly	1
on	1
the	1
judgment	1
and	1
integrity	1
of	1
the	1
Congress;	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
advice,	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
various	1
arts	1
and	1
endeavors	1
used	1
to	1
deter	1
them	1
from	1
it.	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
confide	1
in	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
that	1
Congress,	1
few	1
of	1
whom	1
had	1
been	1
fully	1
tried	1
or	1
generally	1
known,	1
still	1
greater	1
reason	1
have	1
they	1
now	1
to	1
respect	1
the	1
judgment	1
and	1
advice	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
distinguished	1
members	1
of	1
that	1
Congress,	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
since	1
tried	1
and	1
justly	1
approved	1
for	1
patriotism	1
and	1
abilities,	1
and	1
who	1
have	1
grown	1
old	1
in	1
acquiring	1
political	1
information,	1
were	1
also	1
members	1
of	1
this	1
convention,	1
and	1
carried	1
into	1
it	1
their	1
accumulated	1
knowledge	1
and	1
experience.	1
It	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
remark	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
first,	1
but	1
every	1
succeeding	1
Congress,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
late	1
convention,	1
have	1
invariably	1
joined	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
thinking	1
that	1
the	1
prosperity	1
of	1
America	1
depended	1
on	1
its	1
Union.	1
To	1
preserve	1
and	1
perpetuate	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
great	1
object	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
forming	1
that	1
convention,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
the	1
great	1
object	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
which	1
the	1
convention	1
has	1
advised	1
them	1
to	1
adopt.	1
With	1
what	1
propriety,	1
therefore,	1
or	1
for	1
what	1
good	1
purposes,	1
are	1
attempts	1
at	1
this	1
particular	1
period	1
made	1
by	1
some	1
men	1
to	1
depreciate	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
Union?	1
Or	1
why	1
is	1
it	1
suggested	1
that	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
confederacies	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
one?	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
have	1
always	1
thought	1
right	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
universal	1
and	1
uniform	1
attachment	1
to	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
rests	1
on	1
great	1
and	1
weighty	1
reasons,	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
endeavor	1
to	1
develop	1
and	1
explain	1
in	1
some	1
ensuing	1
papers.	1
They	1
who	1
promote	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
substituting	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
distinct	1
confederacies	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
seem	1
clearly	1
to	1
foresee	1
that	1
the	1
rejection	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
put	1
the	1
continuance	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
in	1
the	1
utmost	1
jeopardy.	1
That	1
certainly	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
I	1
sincerely	1
wish	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
clearly	1
foreseen	1
by	1
every	1
good	1
citizen,	1
that	1
whenever	1
the	1
dissolution	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
arrives,	1
America	1
will	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
exclaim,	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
poet:	1
"FAREWELL!	1
A	1
LONG	1
FAREWELL	1
TO	1
ALL	1
MY	1
GREATNESS."	1

JAY	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
IT	1
IS	1
not	1
a	1
new	1
observation	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
any	1
country	1
(if,	1
like	1
the	1
Americans,	1
intelligent	1
and	1
wellinformed)	1
seldom	1
adopt	1
and	1
steadily	1
persevere	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
in	1
an	1
erroneous	1
opinion	1
respecting	1
their	1
interests.	1
That	1
consideration	1
naturally	1
tends	1
to	1
create	1
great	1
respect	1
for	1
the	1
high	1
opinion	1
which	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
have	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
uniformly	1
entertained	1
of	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
their	1
continuing	1
firmly	1
united	1
under	1
one	1
federal	1
government,	1
vested	1
with	1
sufficient	1
powers	1
for	1
all	1
general	1
and	1
national	1
purposes.	1
The	1
more	1
attentively	1
I	1
consider	1
and	1
investigate	1
the	1
reasons	1
which	1
appear	1
to	1
have	1
given	1
birth	1
to	1
this	1
opinion,	1
the	1
more	1
I	1
become	1
convinced	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
cogent	1
and	1
conclusive.	1
Among	1
the	1
many	1
objects	1
to	1
which	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
free	1
people	1
find	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
direct	1
their	1
attention,	1
that	1
of	1
providing	1
for	1
their	1
SAFETY	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first.	1
The	1
SAFETY	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
doubtless	1
has	1
relation	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
variety	1
of	1
circumstances	1
and	1
considerations,	1
and	1
consequently	1
affords	1
great	1
latitude	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
wish	1
to	1
define	1
it	1
precisely	1
and	1
comprehensively.	1
At	1
present	1
I	1
mean	1
only	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
it	1
respects	1
security	1
for	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
tranquillity,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
against	1
dangers	1
from	1
FOREIGN	1
ARMS	1
AND	1
INFLUENCE,	1
as	1
from	1
dangers	1
of	1
the	1
LIKE	1
KIND	1
arising	1
from	1
domestic	1
causes.	1
As	1
the	1
former	1
of	1
these	1
comes	1
first	1
in	1
order,	1
it	1
is	1
proper	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
discussed.	1
Let	1
us	1
therefore	1
proceed	1
to	1
examine	1
whether	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
not	1
right	1
in	1
their	1
opinion	1
that	1
a	1
cordial	1
Union,	1
under	1
an	1
efficient	1
national	1
government,	1
affords	1
them	1
the	1
best	1
security	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
devised	1
against	1
HOSTILITIES	1
from	1
abroad.	1
The	1
number	1
of	1
wars	1
which	1
have	1
happened	1
or	1
will	1
happen	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
and	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
causes,	1
whether	1
REAL	1
or	1
PRETENDED,	1
which	1
PROVOKE	1
or	1
INVITE	1
them.	1
If	1
this	1
remark	1
be	1
just,	1
it	1
becomes	1
useful	1
to	1
inquire	1
whether	1
so	1
many	1
JUST	1
causes	1
of	1
war	1
are	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
by	1
UNITED	1
AMERICA	1
as	1
by	1
DISUNITED	1
America;	1
for	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
turn	1
out	1
that	1
United	1
America	1
will	1
probably	1
give	1
the	1
fewest,	1
then	1
it	1
will	1
follow	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
the	1
Union	1
tends	1
most	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
peace	1
with	1
other	1
nations.	1
The	1
JUST	1
causes	1
of	1
war,	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part,	1
arise	1
either	1
from	1
violation	1
of	1
treaties	1
or	1
from	1
direct	1
violence.	1
America	1
has	1
already	1
formed	1
treaties	1
with	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
six	1
foreign	1
nations,	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them,	1
except	1
Prussia,	1
are	1
maritime,	1
and	1
therefore	1
able	1
to	1
annoy	1
and	1
injure	1
us.	1
She	1
has	1
also	1
extensive	1
commerce	1
with	1
Portugal,	1
Spain,	1
and	1
Britain,	1
and,	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
latter,	1
has,	1
in	1
addition,	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
neighborhood	1
to	1
attend	1
to.	1
It	1
is	1
of	1
high	1
importance	1
to	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
America	1
that	1
she	1
observe	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
nations	1
towards	1
all	1
these	1
powers,	1
and	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
appears	1
evident	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
perfectly	1
and	1
punctually	1
done	1
by	1
one	1
national	1
government	1
than	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
either	1
by	1
thirteen	1
separate	1
States	1
or	1
by	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
distinct	1
confederacies.	1
Because	1
when	1
once	1
an	1
efficient	1
national	1
government	1
is	1
established,	1
the	1
best	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
will	1
not	1
only	1
consent	1
to	1
serve,	1
but	1
also	1
will	1
generally	1
be	1
appointed	1
to	1
manage	1
it;	1
for,	1
although	1
town	1
or	1
country,	1
or	1
other	1
contracted	1
influence,	1
may	1
place	1
men	1
in	1
State	1
assemblies,	1
or	1
senates,	1
or	1
courts	1
of	1
justice,	1
or	1
executive	1
departments,	1
yet	1
more	1
general	1
and	1
extensive	1
reputation	1
for	1
talents	1
and	1
other	1
qualifications	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
recommend	1
men	1
to	1
offices	1
under	1
the	1
national	1
government,--especially	1
as	1
it	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
widest	1
field	1
for	1
choice,	1
and	1
never	1
experience	1
that	1
want	1
of	1
proper	1
persons	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
uncommon	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
Hence,	1
it	1
will	1
result	1
that	1
the	1
administration,	1
the	1
political	1
counsels,	1
and	1
the	1
judicial	1
decisions	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
wise,	1
systematical,	1
and	1
judicious	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
individual	1
States,	1
and	1
consequently	1
more	1
satisfactory	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
other	1
nations,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
more	1
SAFE	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
us.	1
Because,	1
under	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
treaties	1
and	1
articles	1
of	1
treaties,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
nations,	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
expounded	1
in	1
one	1
sense	1
and	1
executed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner,--whereas,	1
adjudications	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
points	1
and	1
questions,	1
in	1
thirteen	1
States,	1
or	1
in	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
confederacies,	1
will	1
not	1
always	1
accord	1
or	1
be	1
consistent;	1
and	1
that,	1
as	1
well	1
from	1
the	1
variety	1
of	1
independent	1
courts	1
and	1
judges	1
appointed	1
by	1
different	1
and	1
independent	1
governments,	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
different	1
local	1
laws	1
and	1
interests	1
which	1
may	1
affect	1
and	1
influence	1
them.	1
The	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
in	1
committing	1
such	1
questions	1
to	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
and	1
judgment	1
of	1
courts	1
appointed	1
by	1
and	1
responsible	1
only	1
to	1
one	1
national	1
government,	1
cannot	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
commended.	1
Because	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
present	1
loss	1
or	1
advantage	1
may	1
often	1
tempt	1
the	1
governing	1
party	1
in	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
States	1
to	1
swerve	1
from	1
good	1
faith	1
and	1
justice;	1
but	1
those	1
temptations,	1
not	1
reaching	1
the	1
other	1
States,	1
and	1
consequently	1
having	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
the	1
temptation	1
will	1
be	1
fruitless,	1
and	1
good	1
faith	1
and	1
justice	1
be	1
preserved.	1
The	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
treaty	1
of	1
peace	1
with	1
Britain	1
adds	1
great	1
weight	1
to	1
this	1
reasoning.	1
Because,	1
even	1
if	1
the	1
governing	1
party	1
in	1
a	1
State	1
should	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
resist	1
such	1
temptations,	1
yet	1
as	1
such	1
temptations	1
may,	1
and	1
commonly	1
do,	1
result	1
from	1
circumstances	1
peculiar	1
to	1
the	1
State,	1
and	1
may	1
affect	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants,	1
the	1
governing	1
party	1
may	1
not	1
always	1
be	1
able,	1
if	1
willing,	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
injustice	1
meditated,	1
or	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
aggressors.	1
But	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
not	1
being	1
affected	1
by	1
those	1
local	1
circumstances,	1
will	1
neither	1
be	1
induced	1
to	1
commit	1
the	1
wrong	1
themselves,	1
nor	1
want	1
power	1
or	1
inclination	1
to	1
prevent	1
or	1
punish	1
its	1
commission	1
by	1
others.	1
So	1
far,	1
therefore,	1
as	1
either	1
designed	1
or	1
accidental	1
violations	1
of	1
treaties	1
and	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
nations	1
afford	1
JUST	1
causes	1
of	1
war,	1
they	1
are	1
less	1
to	1
be	1
apprehended	1
under	1
one	1
general	1
government	1
than	1
under	1
several	1
lesser	1
ones,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
respect	1
the	1
former	1
most	1
favors	1
the	1
SAFETY	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
As	1
to	1
those	1
just	1
causes	1
of	1
war	1
which	1
proceed	1
from	1
direct	1
and	1
unlawful	1
violence,	1
it	1
appears	1
equally	1
clear	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
one	1
good	1
national	1
government	1
affords	1
vastly	1
more	1
security	1
against	1
dangers	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
than	1
can	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
any	1
other	1
quarter.	1
Because	1
such	1
violences	1
are	1
more	1
frequently	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
passions	1
and	1
interests	1
of	1
a	1
part	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
whole;	1
of	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
States	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
Not	1
a	1
single	1
Indian	1
war	1
has	1
yet	1
been	1
occasioned	1
by	1
aggressions	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
federal	1
government,	1
feeble	1
as	1
it	1
is;	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
several	1
instances	1
of	1
Indian	1
hostilities	1
having	1
been	1
provoked	1
by	1
the	1
improper	1
conduct	1
of	1
individual	1
States,	1
who,	1
either	1
unable	1
or	1
unwilling	1
to	1
restrain	1
or	1
punish	1
offenses,	1
have	1
given	1
occasion	1
to	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
many	1
innocent	1
inhabitants.	1
The	1
neighborhood	1
of	1
Spanish	1
and	1
British	1
territories,	1
bordering	1
on	1
some	1
States	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
others,	1
naturally	1
confines	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
quarrel	1
more	1
immediately	1
to	1
the	1
borderers.	1
The	1
bordering	1
States,	1
if	1
any,	1
will	1
be	1
those	1
who,	1
under	1
the	1
impulse	1
of	1
sudden	1
irritation,	1
and	1
a	1
quick	1
sense	1
of	1
apparent	1
interest	1
or	1
injury,	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
likely,	1
by	1
direct	1
violence,	1
to	1
excite	1
war	1
with	1
these	1
nations;	1
and	1
nothing	1
can	1
so	1
effectually	1
obviate	1
that	1
danger	1
as	1
a	1
national	1
government,	1
whose	1
wisdom	1
and	1
prudence	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
diminished	1
by	1
the	1
passions	1
which	1
actuate	1
the	1
parties	1
immediately	1
interested.	1
But	1
not	1
only	1
fewer	1
just	1
causes	1
of	1
war	1
will	1
be	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
also	1
be	1
more	1
in	1
their	1
power	1
to	1
accommodate	1
and	1
settle	1
them	1
amicably.	1
They	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
temperate	1
and	1
cool,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
respect,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
others,	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
in	1
capacity	1
to	1
act	1
advisedly	1
than	1
the	1
offending	1
State.	1
The	1
pride	1
of	1
states,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
men,	1
naturally	1
disposes	1
them	1
to	1
justify	1
all	1
their	1
actions,	1
and	1
opposes	1
their	1
acknowledging,	1
correcting,	1
or	1
repairing	1
their	1
errors	1
and	1
offenses.	1
The	1
national	1
government,	1
in	1
such	1
cases,	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
affected	1
by	1
this	1
pride,	1
but	1
will	1
proceed	1
with	1
moderation	1
and	1
candor	1
to	1
consider	1
and	1

on	1
the	1
means	1
most	1
proper	1
to	1
extricate	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
difficulties	1
which	1
threaten	1
them.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
that	1
acknowledgments,	1
explanations,	1
and	1
compensations	1
are	1
often	1
accepted	1
as	1
satisfactory	1
from	1
a	1
strong	1
united	1
nation,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
rejected	1
as	1
unsatisfactory	1
if	1
offered	1
by	1
a	1
State	1
or	1
confederacy	1
of	1
little	1
consideration	1
or	1
power.	1
In	1
the	1
year	1
1685,	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
Genoa	1
having	1
offended	1
Louis	1
XIV.,	1
endeavored	1
to	1
appease	1
him.	1
He	1
demanded	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
send	1
their	1
Doge,	1
or	1
chief	1
magistrate,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
four	1
of	1
their	1
senators,	1
to	1
FRANCE,	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
pardon	1
and	1
receive	1
his	1
terms.	1
They	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
peace.	1
Would	1
he	1
on	1
any	1
occasion	1
either	1
have	1
demanded	1
or	1
have	1
received	1
the	1
like	1
humiliation	1
from	1
Spain,	1
or	1
Britain,	1
or	1
any	1

To	1

New	1

MY	1
LAST	1
paper	1
assigned	1
several	1
reasons	1
why	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
would	1
be	1
best	1
secured	1
by	1
union	1
against	1
the	1
danger	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
exposed	1
to	1
by	1
JUST	1
causes	1
of	1
war	1
given	1
to	1
other	1
nations;	1
and	1
those	1
reasons	1
show	1
that	1
such	1
causes	1
would	1
not	1
only	1
be	1
more	1
rarely	1
given,	1
but	1
would	1
also	1
be	1
more	1
easily	1
accommodated,	1
by	1
a	1
national	1
government	1
than	1
either	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
or	1
the	1
proposed	1
little	1
confederacies.	1
But	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
against	1
dangers	1
from	1
FOREIGN	1
force	1
depends	1
not	1
only	1
on	1
their	1
forbearing	1
to	1
give	1
JUST	1
causes	1
of	1
war	1
to	1
other	1
nations,	1
but	1
also	1
on	1
their	1
placing	1
and	1
continuing	1
themselves	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
situation	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
INVITE	1
hostility	1
or	1
insult;	1
for	1
it	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
observed	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
PRETENDED	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
just	1
causes	1
of	1
war.	1
It	1
is	1
too	1
true,	1
however	1
disgraceful	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
human	1
nature,	1
that	1
nations	1
in	1
general	1
will	1
make	1
war	1
whenever	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
prospect	1
of	1
getting	1
anything	1
by	1
it;	1
nay,	1
absolute	1
monarchs	1
will	1
often	1
make	1
war	1
when	1
their	1
nations	1
are	1
to	1
get	1
nothing	1
by	1
it,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
purposes	1
and	1
objects	1
merely	1
personal,	1
such	1
as	1
thirst	1
for	1
military	1
glory,	1
revenge	1
for	1
personal	1
affronts,	1
ambition,	1
or	1
private	1
compacts	1
to	1
aggrandize	1
or	1
support	1
their	1
particular	1
families	1
or	1
partisans.	1
These	1
and	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
other	1
motives,	1
which	1
affect	1
only	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
sovereign,	1
often	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
wars	1
not	1
sanctified	1
by	1
justice	1
or	1
the	1
voice	1
and	1
interests	1
of	1
his	1
people.	1
But,	1
independent	1
of	1
these	1
inducements	1
to	1
war,	1
which	1
are	1
more	1
prevalent	1
in	1
absolute	1
monarchies,	1
but	1
which	1
well	1
deserve	1
our	1
attention,	1
there	1
are	1
others	1
which	1
affect	1
nations	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
kings;	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
on	1
examination	1
be	1
found	1
to	1
grow	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
relative	1
situation	1
and	1
circumstances.	1
With	1
France	1
and	1
with	1
Britain	1
we	1
are	1
rivals	1
in	1
the	1
fisheries,	1
and	1
can	1
supply	1
their	1
markets	1
cheaper	1
than	1
they	1
can	1
themselves,	1
notwithstanding	1
any	1
efforts	1
to	1
prevent	1
it	1
by	1
bounties	1
on	1
their	1
own	1
or	1
duties	1
on	1
foreign	1
fish.	1
With	1
them	1
and	1
with	1
most	1
other	1
European	1
nations	1
we	1
are	1
rivals	1
in	1
navigation	1
and	1
the	1
carrying	1
trade;	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
deceive	1
ourselves	1
if	1
we	1
suppose	1
that	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
rejoice	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
flourish;	1
for,	1
as	1
our	1
carrying	1
trade	1
cannot	1
increase	1
without	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
diminishing	1
theirs,	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
their	1
interest,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
their	1
policy,	1
to	1
restrain	1
than	1
to	1
promote	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
trade	1
to	1
China	1
and	1
India,	1
we	1
interfere	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
nation,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
it	1
enables	1
us	1
to	1
partake	1
in	1
advantages	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
monopolized,	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
thereby	1
supply	1
ourselves	1
with	1
commodities	1
which	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
purchase	1
from	1
them.	1
The	1
extension	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
commerce	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
vessels	1
cannot	1
give	1
pleasure	1
to	1
any	1
nations	1
who	1
possess	1
territories	1
on	1
or	1
near	1
this	1
continent,	1
because	1
the	1
cheapness	1
and	1
excellence	1
of	1
our	1
productions,	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
vicinity,	1
and	1
the	1
enterprise	1
and	1
address	1
of	1
our	1
merchants	1
and	1
navigators,	1
will	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
greater	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
advantages	1
which	1
those	1
territories	1
afford,	1
than	1
consists	1
with	1
the	1
wishes	1
or	1
policy	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
sovereigns.	1
Spain	1
thinks	1
it	1
convenient	1
to	1
shut	1
the	1
Mississippi	1
against	1
us	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
Britain	1
excludes	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
Saint	1
Lawrence	1
on	1
the	1
other;	1
nor	1
will	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
permit	1
the	1
other	1
waters	1
which	1
are	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
us	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
mutual	1
intercourse	1
and	1
traffic.	1
From	1
these	1
and	1
such	1
like	1
considerations,	1
which	1
might,	1
if	1
consistent	1
with	1
prudence,	1
be	1
more	1
amplified	1
and	1
detailed,	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
jealousies	1
and	1
uneasinesses	1
may	1
gradually	1
slide	1
into	1
the	1
minds	1
and	1
cabinets	1
of	1
other	1
nations,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
regard	1
our	1
advancement	1
in	1
union,	1
in	1
power	1
and	1
consequence	1
by	1
land	1
and	1
by	1
sea,	1
with	1
an	1
eye	1
of	1
indifference	1
and	1
composure.	1
The	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
are	1
aware	1
that	1
inducements	1
to	1
war	1
may	1
arise	1
out	1
of	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
from	1
others	1
not	1
so	1
obvious	1
at	1
present,	1
and	1
that	1
whenever	1
such	1
inducements	1
may	1
find	1
fit	1
time	1
and	1
opportunity	1
for	1
operation,	1
pretenses	1
to	1
color	1
and	1
justify	1
them	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
wanting.	1
Wisely,	1
therefore,	1
do	1
they	1
consider	1
union	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
national	1
government	1
as	1
necessary	1
to	1
put	1
and	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
SUCH	1
A	1
SITUATION	1
as,	1
instead	1
of	1
INVITING	1
war,	1
will	1
tend	1
to	1
repress	1
and	1
discourage	1
it.	1
That	1
situation	1
consists	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
possible	1
state	1
of	1
defense,	1
and	1
necessarily	1
depends	1
on	1
the	1
government,	1
the	1
arms,	1
and	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
As	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
is	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
whole,	1
and	1
cannot	1
be	1
provided	1
for	1
without	1
government,	1
either	1
one	1
or	1
more	1
or	1
many,	1
let	1
us	1
inquire	1
whether	1
one	1
good	1
government	1
is	1
not,	1
relative	1
to	1
the	1
object	1
in	1
question,	1
more	1
competent	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
given	1
number	1
whatever.	1
One	1
government	1
can	1
collect	1
and	1
avail	1
itself	1
of	1
the	1
talents	1
and	1
experience	1
of	1
the	1
ablest	1
men,	1
in	1
whatever	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
found.	1
It	1
can	1
move	1
on	1
uniform	1
principles	1
of	1
policy.	1
It	1
can	1
harmonize,	1
assimilate,	1
and	1
protect	1
the	1
several	1
parts	1
and	1
members,	1
and	1
extend	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
its	1
foresight	1
and	1
precautions	1
to	1
each.	1
In	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
treaties,	1
it	1
will	1
regard	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
whole,	1
and	1
the	1
particular	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
parts	1
as	1
connected	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
whole.	1
It	1
can	1
apply	1
the	1
resources	1
and	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
to	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
any	1
particular	1
part,	1
and	1
that	1
more	1
easily	1
and	1
expeditiously	1
than	1
State	1
governments	1
or	1
separate	1
confederacies	1
can	1
possibly	1
do,	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
concert	1
and	1
unity	1
of	1
system.	1
It	1
can	1
place	1
the	1
militia	1
under	1
one	1
plan	1
of	1
discipline,	1
and,	1
by	1
putting	1
their	1
officers	1
in	1
a	1
proper	1
line	1
of	1
subordination	1
to	1
the	1
Chief	1
Magistrate,	1
will,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
consolidate	1
them	1
into	1
one	1
corps,	1
and	1
thereby	1
render	1
them	1
more	1
efficient	1
than	1
if	1
divided	1
into	1
thirteen	1
or	1
into	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
distinct	1
independent	1
companies.	1
What	1
would	1
the	1
militia	1
of	1
Britain	1
be	1
if	1
the	1
English	1
militia	1
obeyed	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
England,	1
if	1
the	1
Scotch	1
militia	1
obeyed	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
Scotland,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
Welsh	1
militia	1
obeyed	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
Wales?	1
Suppose	1
an	1
invasion;	1
would	1
those	1
three	1
governments	1
(if	1
they	1
agreed	1
at	1
all)	1
be	1
able,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
respective	1
forces,	1
to	1
operate	1
against	1
the	1
enemy	1
so	1
effectually	1
as	1
the	1
single	1
government	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
would?	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
fleets	1
of	1
Britain,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
may	1
come,	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
wise,	1
when	1
the	1
fleets	1
of	1
America	1
may	1
engage	1
attention.	1
But	1
if	1
one	1
national	1
government,	1
had	1
not	1
so	1
regulated	1
the	1
navigation	1
of	1
Britain	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
nursery	1
for	1
seamen--if	1
one	1
national	1
government	1
had	1
not	1
called	1
forth	1
all	1
the	1
national	1
means	1
and	1
materials	1
for	1
forming	1
fleets,	1
their	1
prowess	1
and	1
their	1
thunder	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
celebrated.	1
Let	1
England	1
have	1
its	1
navigation	1
and	1
fleet--let	1
Scotland	1
have	1
its	1
navigation	1
and	1
fleet--let	1
Wales	1
have	1
its	1
navigation	1
and	1
fleet--let	1
Ireland	1
have	1
its	1
navigation	1
and	1
fleet--let	1
those	1
four	1
of	1
the	1
constituent	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
empire	1
be	1
under	1
four	1
independent	1
governments,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
perceive	1
how	1
soon	1
they	1
would	1
each	1
dwindle	1
into	1
comparative	1
insignificance.	1
Apply	1
these	1
facts	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
case.	1
Leave	1
America	1
divided	1
into	1
thirteen	1
or,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
into	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
independent	1
governments--what	1
armies	1
could	1
they	1
raise	1
and	1
pay--what	1
fleets	1
could	1
they	1
ever	1
hope	1
to	1
have?	1
If	1
one	1
was	1
attacked,	1
would	1
the	1
others	1
fly	1
to	1
its	1
succor,	1
and	1
spend	1
their	1
blood	1
and	1
money	1
in	1
its	1
defense?	1
Would	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
danger	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
flattered	1
into	1
neutrality	1
by	1
its	1
specious	1
promises,	1
or	1
seduced	1
by	1
a	1
too	1
great	1
fondness	1
for	1
peace	1
to	1
decline	1
hazarding	1
their	1
tranquillity	1
and	1
present	1
safety	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
neighbors,	1
of	1
whom	1
perhaps	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
jealous,	1
and	1
whose	1
importance	1
they	1
are	1
content	1
to	1
see	1
diminished?	1
Although	1
such	1
conduct	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
wise,	1
it	1
would,	1
nevertheless,	1
be	1
natural.	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
states	1
of	1
Greece,	1
and	1
of	1
other	1
countries,	1
abounds	1
with	1
such	1
instances,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
improbable	1
that	1
what	1
has	1
so	1
often	1
happened	1
would,	1
under	1
similar	1
circumstances,	1
happen	1
again.	1
But	1
admit	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
invaded	1
State	1
or	1
confederacy.	1
How,	1
and	1
when,	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
proportion	1
shall	1
aids	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
money	1
be	1
afforded?	1
Who	1
shall	1
command	1
the	1
allied	1
armies,	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
of	1
them	1
shall	1
he	1
receive	1
his	1
orders?	1
Who	1
shall	1
settle	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
peace,	1
and	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
disputes	1
what	1
umpire	1
shall	1
decide	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
compel	1
acquiescence?	1
Various	1
difficulties	1
and	1
inconveniences	1
would	1
be	1
inseparable	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
situation;	1
whereas	1
one	1
government,	1
watching	1
over	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
common	1
interests,	1
and	1
combining	1
and	1
directing	1
the	1
powers	1
and	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
whole,	1
would	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
these	1
embarrassments,	1
and	1
conduce	1
far	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
But	1
whatever	1
may	1

firmly	1
united	1
under	1
one	1

split	1
into	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
confederacies,	1
certain	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
foreign	1
nations	1
will	1
know	1
and	1
view	1
it	1
exactly	1
as	1
it	1
is;	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
act	1
toward	1
us	1
accordingly.	1
If	1
they	1
see	1
that	1
our	1
national	1
government	1
is	1
efficient	1
and	1
well	1
administered,	1
our	1
trade	1
prudently	1
regulated,	1
our	1
militia	1
properly	1
organized	1
and	1
disciplined,	1
our	1

discreetly	1
managed,	1
our	1
credit	1
re-established,	1
our	1

free,	1

united,	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
more	1
disposed	1
to	1
cultivate	1
our	1
friendship	1
than	1
provoke	1
our	1
resentment.	1
If,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
they	1
find	1
us	1
either	1
destitute	1
of	1
an	1
effectual	1
government	1
(each	1
State	1
doing	1
right	1
or	1
wrong,	1
as	1
to	1
its	1

or	1
split	1
into	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
independent	1

probably	1
discordant	1
republics	1
or	1
confederacies,	1
one	1
inclining	1
to	1
Britain,	1
another	1
to	1
France,	1

a	1
third	1
to	1
Spain,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
played	1
off	1
against	1

the	1
three,	1
what	1
a	1
poor,	1
pitiful	1

How	1

not	1

to	1

I	1
shall	1
present	1
the	1
public	1
with	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
extracts	1
from	1
it:	1
"An	1
entire	1
and	1
perfect	1
union	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
solid	1
foundation	1
of	1
lasting	1
peace:	1
It	1
will	1
secure	1
your	1
religion,	1
liberty,	1
and	1

remove	1
the	1
animosities	1
amongst	1
yourselves,	1
and	1
the	1
jealousies	1
and	1
differences	1
betwixt	1
our	1
two	1
kingdoms.	1
It	1
must	1
increase	1
your	1
strength,	1
riches,	1
and	1
trade;	1
and	1
by	1
this	1
union	1
the	1
whole	1
island,	1
being	1
joined	1
in	1
affection	1
and	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
apprehensions	1
of	1
different	1
interest,	1
will	1
be	1
ENABLED	1
TO	1
RESIST	1
ALL	1
ITS	1
ENEMIES."	1
"We	1
most	1
earnestly	1
recommend	1
to	1
you	1
calmness	1
and	1
unanimity	1
in	1
this	1
great	1
and	1
weighty	1
affair,	1
that	1
the	1
union	1
may	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
happy	1
conclusion,	1
being	1
the	1
only	1
EFFECTUAL	1
way	1
to	1
secure	1
our	1
present	1
and	1
future	1
happiness,	1
and	1
disappoint	1
the	1
designs	1
of	1
our	1
and	1
your	1
enemies,	1
who	1
will	1
doubtless,	1
on	1
this	1
occasion,	1
USE	1
THEIR	1
UTMOST	1
ENDEAVORS	1
TO	1
PREVENT	1
OR	1
DELAY	1
THIS	1
UNION."	1
It	1
was	1
remarked	1
in	1
the	1
preceding	1
paper,	1
that	1
weakness	1
and	1
divisions	1
at	1
home	1
would	1
invite	1
dangers	1
from	1
abroad;	1
and	1
that	1
nothing	1
would	1
tend	1
more	1
to	1
secure	1
us	1
from	1
them	1
than	1
union,	1
strength,	1
and	1
good	1
government	1
within	1
ourselves.	1
This	1
subject	1
is	1
copious	1
and	1
cannot	1
easily	1
be	1
exhausted.	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
general	1
the	1
best	1
acquainted,	1
and	1
it	1
gives	1
us	1
many	1
useful	1
lessons.	1
We	1
may	1
profit	1
by	1
their	1
experience	1
without	1
paying	1
the	1
price	1
which	1
it	1
cost	1
them.	1
Although	1
it	1
seems	1
obvious	1
to	1
common	1
sense	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
island	1
should	1
be	1
but	1
one	1
nation,	1
yet	1
we	1
find	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
for	1
ages	1
divided	1
into	1
three,	1
and	1
that	1
those	1
three	1
were	1
almost	1
constantly	1
embroiled	1
in	1
quarrels	1
and	1
wars	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
Notwithstanding	1
their	1
true	1
interest	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
continental	1
nations	1
was	1
really	1
the	1
same,	1
yet	1
by	1
the	1
arts	1
and	1
policy	1
and	1
practices	1
of	1
those	1
nations,	1
their	1
mutual	1
jealousies	1
were	1
perpetually	1
kept	1
inflamed,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
series	1
of	1
years	1
they	1
were	1
far	1
more	1
inconvenient	1
and	1
troublesome	1
than	1
they	1
were	1
useful	1
and	1
assisting	1
to	1
each	1
other.	1
Should	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
divide	1
themselves	1
into	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
nations,	1
would	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
happen?	1
Would	1
not	1
similar	1
jealousies	1
arise,	1
and	1
be	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
cherished?	1
Instead	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
"joined	1
in	1
affection"	1
and	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
apprehension	1
of	1
different	1
"interests,"	1
envy	1
and	1
jealousy	1
would	1
soon	1
extinguish	1
confidence	1
and	1
affection,	1
and	1
the	1
partial	1
interests	1
of	1
each	1
confederacy,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
interests	1
of	1
all	1
America,	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
objects	1
of	1
their	1
policy	1
and	1
pursuits.	1
Hence,	1
like	1
most	1
other	1
BORDERING	1
nations,	1
they	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
either	1
involved	1
in	1
disputes	1
and	1
war,	1
or	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
constant	1
apprehension	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
most	1
sanguine	1
advocates	1
for	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
confederacies	1
cannot	1
reasonably	1
suppose	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
long	1
remain	1
exactly	1
on	1
an	1
equal	1
footing	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
strength,	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
possible	1
to	1
form	1
them	1
so	1
at	1
first;	1
but,	1
admitting	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
practicable,	1
yet	1
what	1
human	1
contrivance	1
can	1
secure	1
the	1
continuance	1
of	1
such	1
equality?	1
Independent	1
of	1
those	1
local	1
circumstances	1
which	1
tend	1
to	1
beget	1
and	1
increase	1
power	1
in	1
one	1
part	1
and	1
to	1
impede	1
its	1
progress	1
in	1
another,	1
we	1
must	1
advert	1
to	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
that	1
superior	1
policy	1
and	1
good	1
management	1
which	1
would	1
probably	1
distinguish	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
one	1
above	1
the	1
rest,	1
and	1
by	1
which	1
their	1
relative	1
equality	1
in	1
strength	1
and	1
consideration	1
would	1
be	1
destroyed.	1
For	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
presumed	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
degree	1
of	1
sound	1
policy,	1
prudence,	1
and	1
foresight	1
would	1
uniformly	1
be	1
observed	1
by	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
confederacies	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
succession	1
of	1
years.	1
Whenever,	1
and	1
from	1
whatever	1
causes,	1
it	1
might	1
happen,	1
and	1
happen	1
it	1
would,	1
that	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
nations	1
or	1
confederacies	1
should	1
rise	1
on	1
the	1
scale	1
of	1
political	1
importance	1
much	1
above	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
her	1
neighbors,	1
that	1
moment	1
would	1
those	1
neighbors	1
behold	1
her	1
with	1
envy	1
and	1
with	1
fear.	1
Both	1
those	1
passions	1
would	1
lead	1
them	1
to	1
countenance,	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
promote,	1
whatever	1
might	1
promise	1
to	1
diminish	1
her	1
importance;	1
and	1
would	1
also	1
restrain	1
them	1
from	1
measures	1
calculated	1
to	1
advance	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
secure	1
her	1
prosperity.	1
Much	1
time	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
enable	1
her	1
to	1
discern	1
these	1
unfriendly	1
dispositions.	1
She	1
would	1
soon	1
begin,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
lose	1
confidence	1
in	1
her	1
neighbors,	1
but	1
also	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
disposition	1
equally	1
unfavorable	1
to	1
them.	1
Distrust	1
naturally	1
creates	1
distrust,	1
and	1
by	1
nothing	1
is	1
good-will	1
and	1
kind	1
conduct	1
more	1
speedily	1
changed	1
than	1
by	1
invidious	1
jealousies	1
and	1
uncandid	1
imputations,	1
whether	1
expressed	1
or	1
implied.	1
The	1
North	1
is	1
generally	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
strength,	1
and	1
many	1
local	1
circumstances	1
render	1
it	1
probable	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
Northern	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
confederacies	1
would,	1
at	1
a	1
period	1
not	1
very	1
distant,	1
be	1
unquestionably	1
more	1
formidable	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
No	1
sooner	1
would	1
this	1
become	1
evident	1
than	1
the	1
NORTHERN	1
HIVE	1
would	1
excite	1
the	1
same	1
ideas	1
and	1
sensations	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
southern	1
parts	1
of	1
America	1
which	1
it	1
formerly	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
southern	1
parts	1
of	1
Europe.	1
Nor	1
does	1
it	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
rash	1
conjecture	1
that	1
its	1
young	1
swarms	1
might	1
often	1
be	1
tempted	1
to	1
gather	1
honey	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
blooming	1
fields	1
and	1
milder	1
air	1
of	1
their	1
luxurious	1
and	1
more	1
delicate	1
neighbors.	1
They	1
who	1
well	1
consider	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
similar	1
divisions	1
and	1
confederacies	1
will	1
find	1
abundant	1
reason	1
to	1
apprehend	1
that	1
those	1
in	1
contemplation	1
would	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
sense	1
be	1
neighbors	1
than	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
borderers;	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
neither	1
love	1
nor	1
trust	1
one	1
another,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
prey	1
to	1
discord,	1
jealousy,	1
and	1
mutual	1
injuries;	1
in	1
short,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
place	1
us	1
exactly	1
in	1
the	1
situations	1
in	1
which	1
some	1
nations	1
doubtless	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
us,	1
viz.,	1
FORMIDABLE	1
ONLY	1
TO	1
EACH	1
OTHER.	1
From	1
these	1
considerations	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
those	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
greatly	1
mistaken	1
who	1
suppose	1
that	1
alliances	1
offensive	1
and	1
defensive	1
might	1
be	1
formed	1
between	1
these	1
confederacies,	1
and	1
would	1
produce	1
that	1
combination	1
and	1
union	1
of	1
wills	1
of	1
arms	1
and	1
of	1
resources,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
put	1
and	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
formidable	1
state	1
of	1
defense	1
against	1
foreign	1
enemies.	1
When	1
did	1
the	1
independent	1
states,	1
into	1
which	1
Britain	1
and	1
Spain	1
were	1
formerly	1
divided,	1
combine	1
in	1
such	1
alliance,	1
or	1
unite	1
their	1
forces	1
against	1
a	1
foreign	1
enemy?	1
The	1
proposed	1
confederacies	1
will	1
be	1
DISTINCT	1
NATIONS.	1
Each	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
have	1
its	1
commerce	1
with	1
foreigners	1
to	1
regulate	1
by	1
distinct	1
treaties;	1
and	1
as	1
their	1
productions	1
and	1
commodities	1
are	1
different	1
and	1
proper	1
for	1
different	1
markets,	1
so	1
would	1
those	1
treaties	1
be	1
essentially	1
different.	1
Different	1
commercial	1
concerns	1
must	1
create	1
different	1
interests,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
different	1
degrees	1
of	1
political	1
attachment	1
to	1
and	1
connection	1
with	1
different	1
foreign	1
nations.	1
Hence	1
it	1
might	1
and	1
probably	1
would	1
happen	1
that	1
the	1
foreign	1
nation	1
with	1
whom	1
the	1
SOUTHERN	1
confederacy	1
might	1
be	1
at	1
war	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
whom	1
the	1
NORTHERN	1
confederacy	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
desirous	1
of	1
preserving	1
peace	1
and	1
friendship.	1
An	1
alliance	1
so	1
contrary	1
to	1
their	1
immediate	1
interest	1
would	1
not	1
therefore	1
be	1
easy	1
to	1
form,	1
nor,	1
if	1
formed,	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
observed	1
and	1
fulfilled	1
with	1
perfect	1
good	1
faith.	1
Nay,	1
it	1
is	1
far	1
more	1
probable	1
that	1
in	1
America,	1
as	1
in	1
Europe,	1
neighboring	1
nations,	1
acting	1
under	1
the	1
impulse	1
of	1
opposite	1
interests	1
and	1
unfriendly	1
passions,	1
would	1
frequently	1
be	1
found	1
taking	1
different	1
sides.	1
Considering	1
our	1
distance	1
from	1
Europe,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
natural	1
for	1
these	1
confederacies	1
to	1
apprehend	1
danger	1
from	1
one	1
another	1
than	1
from	1
distant	1
nations,	1
and	1
therefore	1
that	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
be	1
more	1
desirous	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
the	1
others	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
foreign	1
alliances,	1
than	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
foreign	1
dangers	1
by	1
alliances	1
between	1
themselves.	1
And	1
here	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
forget	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
easy	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
receive	1
foreign	1
fleets	1
into	1
our	1
ports,	1
and	1
foreign	1
armies	1
into	1
our	1
country,	1
than	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
persuade	1
or	1
compel	1
them	1
to	1
depart.	1
How	1
many	1
conquests	1
did	1
the	1
Romans	1
and	1
others	1
make	1
in	1
the	1
characters	1
of	1
allies,	1
and	1
what	1
innovations	1
did	1
they	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
character	1
introduce	1
into	1
the	1
governments	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
they	1
pretended	1
to	1
protect.	1
Let	1
candid	1
men	1
judge,	1
then,	1
whether	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
America	1
into	1
any	1
given	1
number	1
of	1
independent	1
sovereignties	1
would	1
tend	1
to	1
secure	1
us	1
against	1
the	1
hostilities	1
and	1
improper	1
interference	1
of	1
foreign	1
nations.	1

New	1
York:	1
THE	1
three	1
last	1
numbers	1
of	1
this	1
paper	1
have	1
been	1
dedicated	1
to	1
an	1
enumeration	1
of	1
the	1
dangers	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
exposed,	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
disunion,	1
from	1
the	1
arms	1
and	1
arts	1
of	1
foreign	1
nations.	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
proceed	1
to	1
delineate	1
dangers	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
and,	1
perhaps,	1
still	1
more	1
alarming	1
kind--those	1
which	1
will	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
flow	1
from	1
dissensions	1
between	1
the	1
States	1
themselves,	1
and	1
from	1
domestic	1
factions	1
and	1
convulsions.	1
These	1
have	1
been	1
already	1
in	1
some	1
instances	1
slightly	1
anticipated;	1
but	1
they	1
deserve	1
a	1
more	1
particular	1
and	1
more	1
full	1
investigation.	1
A	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
far	1
gone	1
in	1
Utopian	1
speculations	1
who	1
can	1
seriously	1
doubt	1
that,	1
if	1
these	1
States	1
should	1
either	1
be	1
wholly	1
disunited,	1
or	1
only	1
united	1
in	1
partial	1
confederacies,	1
the	1
subdivisions	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
thrown	1
would	1
have	1
frequent	1
and	1
violent	1
contests	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
To	1
presume	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
motives	1
for	1
such	1
contests	1
as	1
an	1
argument	1
against	1
their	1
existence,	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
forget	1
that	1
men	1
are	1
ambitious,	1
vindictive,	1
and	1
rapacious.	1
To	1
look	1
for	1
a	1
continuation	1
of	1
harmony	1
between	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
independent,	1
unconnected	1
sovereignties	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
neighborhood,	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
disregard	1
the	1
uniform	1
course	1
of	1
human	1
events,	1
and	1
to	1
set	1
at	1
defiance	1
the	1
accumulated	1
experience	1
of	1
ages.	1
The	1
causes	1
of	1
hostility	1
among	1
nations	1
are	1
innumerable.	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
which	1
have	1
a	1
general	1
and	1
almost	1
constant	1
operation	1
upon	1
the	1
collective	1
bodies	1
of	1
society.	1
Of	1
this	1
description	1
are	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
power	1
or	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
pre-eminence	1
and	1
dominion--the	1
jealousy	1
of	1
power,	1
or	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
equality	1
and	1
safety.	1
There	1
are	1
others	1
which	1
have	1
a	1
more	1
circumscribed	1
though	1
an	1
equally	1
operative	1
influence	1
within	1
their	1
spheres.	1
Such	1
are	1
the	1
rivalships	1
and	1
competitions	1
of	1
commerce	1
between	1
commercial	1
nations.	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
others,	1
not	1
less	1
numerous	1
than	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
former,	1
which	1
take	1
their	1
origin	1
entirely	1
in	1
private	1
passions;	1
in	1
the	1
attachments,	1
enmities,	1
interests,	1
hopes,	1
and	1
fears	1
of	1
leading	1
individuals	1
in	1
the	1
communities	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
members.	1
Men	1
of	1
this	1
class,	1
whether	1
the	1
favorites	1
of	1
a	1
king	1
or	1
of	1
a	1
people,	1
have	1
in	1
too	1
many	1
instances	1
abused	1
the	1
confidence	1
they	1
possessed;	1
and	1
assuming	1
the	1
pretext	1
of	1
some	1
public	1
motive,	1
have	1
not	1
scrupled	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
national	1
tranquillity	1
to	1
personal	1
advantage	1
or	1
personal	1
gratification.	1
The	1
celebrated	1
Pericles,	1
in	1
compliance	1
with	1
the	1
resentment	1
of	1
a	1
prostitute,1	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
and	1
treasure	1
of	1
his	1
countrymen,	1
attacked,	1
vanquished,	1
and	1
destroyed	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
SAMNIANS.	1
The	1
same	1
man,	1
stimulated	1
by	1
private	1
pique	1
against	1
the	1
MEGARENSIANS,2	1
another	1
nation	1
of	1
Greece,	1
or	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
prosecution	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
threatened	1
as	1
an	1
accomplice	1
of	1
a	1
supposed	1
theft	1
of	1
the	1
statuary	1
Phidias,3	1
or	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
accusations	1
prepared	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
against	1
him	1
for	1
dissipating	1
the	1
funds	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
in	1
the	1
purchase	1
of	1
popularity,4	1
or	1
from	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
causes,	1
was	1
the	1
primitive	1
author	1
of	1
that	1
famous	1
and	1
fatal	1
war,	1
distinguished	1
in	1
the	1
Grecian	1
annals	1
by	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
PELOPONNESIAN	1
war;	1
which,	1
after	1
various	1
vicissitudes,	1
intermissions,	1
and	1
renewals,	1
terminated	1
in	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
the	1
Athenian	1
commonwealth.	1
The	1
ambitious	1
cardinal,	1
who	1
was	1
prime	1
minister	1
to	1
Henry	1
VIII.,	1
permitting	1
his	1
vanity	1
to	1
aspire	1
to	1
the	1
triple	1
crown,5	1
entertained	1
hopes	1
of	1
succeeding	1
in	1
the	1
acquisition	1
of	1
that	1
splendid	1
prize	1
by	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Charles	1
V.	1
To	1
secure	1
the	1
favor	1
and	1
interest	1
of	1
this	1
enterprising	1
and	1
powerful	1
monarch,	1
he	1
precipitated	1
England	1
into	1
a	1
war	1
with	1
France,	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
plainest	1
dictates	1
of	1
policy,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
hazard	1
of	1
the	1
safety	1
and	1
independence,	1
as	1
well	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
over	1
which	1
he	1
presided	1
by	1
his	1
counsels,	1
as	1
of	1
Europe	1
in	1
general.	1
For	1
if	1
there	1
ever	1
was	1
a	1
sovereign	1
who	1
bid	1
fair	1
to	1
realize	1
the	1
project	1
of	1
universal	1
monarchy,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Charles	1
V.,	1
of	1
whose	1
intrigues	1
Wolsey	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
instrument	1
and	1
the	1
dupe.	1
The	1
influence	1
which	1
the	1
bigotry	1
of	1
one	1
female,6	1
the	1
petulance	1
of	1
another,7	1
and	1
the	1
cabals	1
of	1
a	1
third,8	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
contemporary	1
policy,	1
ferments,	1
and	1
pacifications,	1
of	1
a	1
considerable	1
part	1
of	1
Europe,	1
are	1
topics	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
often	1
descanted	1
upon	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
generally	1
known.	1
To	1
multiply	1
examples	1
of	1
the	1
agency	1
of	1
personal	1
considerations	1
in	1
the	1
production	1
of	1
great	1
national	1
events,	1
either	1
foreign	1
or	1
domestic,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
direction,	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
unnecessary	1
waste	1
of	1
time.	1
Those	1
who	1
have	1
but	1
a	1
superficial	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
the	1
sources	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
drawn,	1
will	1
themselves	1
recollect	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
instances;	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
a	1
tolerable	1
knowledge	1
of	1
human	1
nature	1
will	1
not	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
such	1
lights	1
to	1
form	1
their	1
opinion	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
reality	1
or	1
extent	1
of	1
that	1
agency.	1
Perhaps,	1
however,	1
a	1
reference,	1
tending	1
to	1
illustrate	1
the	1
general	1
principle,	1
may	1
with	1
propriety	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
a	1
case	1
which	1
has	1
lately	1
happened	1
among	1
ourselves.	1
If	1
Shays	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
DESPERATE	1
DEBTOR,	1
it	1
is	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
doubted	1
whether	1
Massachusetts	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
plunged	1
into	1
a	1
civil	1
war.	1
But	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
concurring	1
testimony	1
of	1
experience,	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
there	1
are	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
visionary	1
or	1
designing	1
men,	1
who	1
stand	1
ready	1
to	1
advocate	1
the	1
paradox	1
of	1
perpetual	1
peace	1
between	1
the	1
States,	1
though	1
dismembered	1
and	1
alienated	1
from	1
each	1
other.	1
The	1
genius	1
of	1
republics	1
(say	1
they)	1
is	1
pacific;	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
commerce	1
has	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
soften	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
to	1
extinguish	1
those	1
inflammable	1
humors	1
which	1
have	1
so	1
often	1
kindled	1
into	1
wars.	1
Commercial	1
republics,	1
like	1
ours,	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
waste	1
themselves	1
in	1
ruinous	1
contentions	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
They	1
will	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
mutual	1
interest,	1
and	1
will	1
cultivate	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
mutual	1
amity	1
and	1
concord.	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
(we	1
may	1
ask	1
these	1
projectors	1
in	1
politics)	1
the	1
true	1
interest	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
to	1
cultivate	1
the	1
same	1
benevolent	1
and	1
philosophic	1
spirit?	1
If	1
this	1
be	1
their	1
true	1
interest,	1
have	1
they	1
in	1
fact	1
pursued	1
it?	1
Has	1
it	1
not,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
invariably	1
been	1
found	1
that	1
momentary	1
passions,	1
and	1
immediate	1
interest,	1
have	1
a	1
more	1
active	1
and	1
imperious	1
control	1
over	1
human	1
conduct	1
than	1
general	1
or	1
remote	1
considerations	1
of	1
policy,	1
utility	1
or	1
justice?	1
Have	1
republics	1
in	1
practice	1
been	1
less	1
addicted	1
to	1
war	1
than	1
monarchies?	1
Are	1
not	1
the	1
former	1
administered	1
by	1
MEN	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
latter?	1
Are	1
there	1
not	1
aversions,	1
predilections,	1
rivalships,	1
and	1
desires	1
of	1
unjust	1
acquisitions,	1
that	1
affect	1
nations	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
kings?	1
Are	1
not	1
popular	1
assemblies	1
frequently	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
impulses	1
of	1
rage,	1
resentment,	1
jealousy,	1
avarice,	1
and	1
of	1
other	1
irregular	1
and	1
violent	1
propensities?	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
well	1
known	1
that	1
their	1
determinations	1
are	1
often	1
governed	1
by	1
a	1
few	1
individuals	1
in	1
whom	1
they	1
place	1
confidence,	1
and	1
are,	1
of	1
course,	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
tinctured	1
by	1
the	1
passions	1
and	1
views	1
of	1
those	1
individuals?	1
Has	1
commerce	1
hitherto	1
done	1
anything	1
more	1
than	1
change	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
war?	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
wealth	1
as	1
domineering	1
and	1
enterprising	1
a	1
passion	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
power	1
or	1
glory?	1
Have	1
there	1
not	1
been	1
as	1
many	1
wars	1
founded	1
upon	1
commercial	1
motives	1
since	1
that	1
has	1
become	1
the	1
prevailing	1
system	1
of	1
nations,	1
as	1
were	1
before	1
occasioned	1
by	1
the	1
cupidity	1
of	1
territory	1
or	1
dominion?	1
Has	1
not	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
commerce,	1
in	1
many	1
instances,	1
administered	1
new	1
incentives	1
to	1
the	1
appetite,	1
both	1
for	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
other?	1
Let	1
experience,	1
the	1
least	1
fallible	1
guide	1
of	1
human	1
opinions,	1
be	1
appealed	1
to	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
these	1
inquiries.	1
Sparta,	1
Athens,	1
Rome,	1
and	1
Carthage	1
were	1
all	1
republics;	1
two	1
of	1
them,	1
Athens	1
and	1
Carthage,	1
of	1
the	1
commercial	1
kind.	1
Yet	1
were	1
they	1
as	1
often	1
engaged	1
in	1
wars,	1
offensive	1
and	1
defensive,	1
as	1
the	1
neighboring	1
monarchies	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
times.	1
Sparta	1
was	1
little	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
wellregulated	1
camp;	1
and	1
Rome	1
was	1
never	1
sated	1
of	1
carnage	1
and	1
conquest.	1
Carthage,	1
though	1
a	1
commercial	1
republic,	1
was	1
the	1
aggressor	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
war	1
that	1
ended	1
in	1
her	1
destruction.	1
Hannibal	1
had	1
carried	1
her	1
arms	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Italy	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
Rome,	1
before	1
Scipio,	1
in	1
turn,	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
overthrow	1
in	1
the	1
territories	1
of	1
Carthage,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
conquest	1
of	1
the	1
commonwealth.	1
Venice,	1
in	1
later	1
times,	1
figured	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
in	1
wars	1
of	1
ambition,	1
till,	1
becoming	1
an	1
object	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
Italian	1
states,	1
Pope	1
Julius	1
II.	1
found	1
means	1
to	1
accomplish	1
that	1
formidable	1
league,9	1
which	1
gave	1
a	1
deadly	1
blow	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
pride	1
of	1
this	1
haughty	1
republic.	1
The	1
provinces	1
of	1
Holland,	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
overwhelmed	1
in	1
debts	1
and	1
taxes,	1
took	1
a	1
leading	1
and	1
conspicuous	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
wars	1
of	1
Europe.	1
They	1
had	1
furious	1
contests	1
with	1
England	1
for	1
the	1
dominion	1
of	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
were	1
among	1
the	1
most	1
persevering	1
and	1
most	1
implacable	1
of	1
the	1
opponents	1
of	1
Louis	1
XIV.	1
In	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
Britain	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
compose	1
one	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
legislature.	1
Commerce	1
has	1
been	1
for	1
ages	1
the	1
predominant	1
pursuit	1
of	1
that	1
country.	1
Few	1
nations,	1
nevertheless,	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
frequently	1
engaged	1
in	1
war;	1
and	1
the	1
wars	1
in	1
which	1
that	1
kingdom	1
has	1
been	1
engaged	1
have,	1
in	1
numerous	1
instances,	1
proceeded	1
from	1
the	1
people.	1
There	1
have	1
been,	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
so	1
express	1
it,	1
almost	1
as	1
many	1
popular	1
as	1
royal	1
wars.	1
The	1
cries	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
and	1
the	1
importunities	1
of	1
their	1
representatives	1
have,	1
upon	1
various	1
occasions,	1
dragged	1
their	1
monarchs	1
into	1
war,	1
or	1
continued	1
them	1
in	1
it,	1
contrary	1
to	1
their	1
inclinations,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
real	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
State.	1
In	1
that	1
memorable	1
struggle	1
for	1
superiority	1
between	1
the	1
rival	1
houses	1
of	1
AUSTRIA	1
and	1
BOURBON,	1
which	1
so	1
long	1
kept	1
Europe	1
in	1
a	1
flame,	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
antipathies	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
against	1
the	1
French,	1
seconding	1
the	1
ambition,	1
or	1
rather	1
the	1
avarice,	1
of	1
a	1
favorite	1
leader,10	1
protracted	1
the	1
war	1
beyond	1
the	1
limits	1
marked	1
out	1
by	1
sound	1
policy,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
court.	1
The	1
wars	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
last-mentioned	1
nations	1
have	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure	1
grown	1
out	1
of	1
commercial	1
considerations,--the	1
desire	1
of	1
supplanting	1
and	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
being	1
supplanted,	1
either	1
in	1
particular	1
branches	1
of	1
traffic	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
advantages	1
of	1
trade	1
and	1
navigation.	1
From	1
this	1
summary	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
taken	1
place	1
in	1
other	1
countries,	1
whose	1
situations	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
nearest	1
resemblance	1
to	1
our	1
own,	1
what	1
reason	1
can	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
confide	1
in	1
those	1
reveries	1
which	1
would	1
seduce	1
us	1
into	1
an	1
expectation	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
cordiality	1
between	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
confederacy,	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
separation?	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
already	1
seen	1
enough	1
of	1
the	1
fallacy	1
and	1
extravagance	1
of	1
those	1
idle	1
theories	1
which	1
have	1
amused	1
us	1
with	1
promises	1
of	1
an	1
exemption	1
from	1
the	1
imperfections,	1
weaknesses	1
and	1
evils	1
incident	1
to	1
society	1
in	1
every	1
shape?	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
awake	1
from	1
the	1
deceitful	1
dream	1
of	1
a	1
golden	1
age,	1
and	1
to	1
adopt	1
as	1
a	1
practical	1
maxim	1
for	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
our	1
political	1
conduct	1
that	1
we,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
globe,	1
are	1
yet	1
remote	1
from	1
the	1
happy	1
empire	1
of	1
perfect	1
wisdom	1
and	1
perfect	1
virtue?	1
Let	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
extreme	1
depression	1
to	1
which	1
our	1
national	1
dignity	1
and	1
credit	1
have	1
sunk,	1
let	1
the	1
inconveniences	1
felt	1
everywhere	1
from	1
a	1
lax	1
and	1
ill	1
administration	1
of	1
government,	1
let	1
the	1
revolt	1
of	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
North	1
Carolina,	1
the	1
late	1
menacing	1
disturbances	1
in	1
Pennsylvania,	1
and	1
the	1
actual	1
insurrections	1
and	1
rebellions	1
in	1
Massachusetts,	1
declare--!	1
So	1
far	1
is	1
the	1
general	1
sense	1
of	1
mankind	1
from	1
corresponding	1
with	1
the	1
tenets	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
endeavor	1
to	1
lull	1
asleep	1
our	1
apprehensions	1
of	1
discord	1
and	1
hostility	1
between	1
the	1
States,	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
disunion,	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
from	1
long	1
observation	1
of	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
society	1
become	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
axiom	1
in	1
politics,	1
that	1
vicinity	1
or	1
nearness	1
of	1
situation,	1
constitutes	1
nations	1
natural	1
enemies.	1
An	1
intelligent	1
writer	1
expresses	1
himself	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
to	1
this	1
effect:	1
"NEIGHBORING	1
NATIONS	1
(says	1
he)	1

naturally	1
enemies	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
unless	1
their	1
common	1
weakness	1
forces	1

a	1
CONFEDERATE	1

and	1
their	1

that	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
IT	1
IS	1
sometimes	1
asked,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
seeming	1
triumph,	1
what	1
inducements	1
could	1
the	1
States	1
have,	1
if	1
disunited,	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
upon	1
each	1
other?	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
full	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
question	1
to	1
say--precisely	1
the	1
same	1
inducements	1
which	1
have,	1
at	1
different	1
times,	1
deluged	1
in	1
blood	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
But,	1
unfortunately	1
for	1
us,	1
the	1
question	1
admits	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
particular	1
answer.	1
There	1
are	1
causes	1
of	1
differences	1
within	1
our	1
immediate	1
contemplation,	1
of	1
the	1
tendency	1
of	1
which,	1
even	1
under	1
the	1
restraints	1
of	1
a	1
federal	1
constitution,	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
sufficient	1
experience	1
to	1
enable	1
us	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
judgment	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
expected	1
if	1
those	1
restraints	1
were	1
removed.	1
Territorial	1
disputes	1
have	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
been	1
found	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
fertile	1
sources	1
of	1
hostility	1
among	1
nations.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
greatest	1
proportion	1
of	1
wars	1
that	1
have	1
desolated	1
the	1
earth	1
have	1
sprung	1
from	1
this	1
origin.	1
This	1
cause	1
would	1
exist	1
among	1
us	1
in	1
full	1
force.	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
vast	1
tract	1
of	1
unsettled	1
territory	1
within	1
the	1
boundaries	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
There	1
still	1
are	1
discordant	1
and	1
undecided	1
claims	1
between	1
several	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
dissolution	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
would	1
lay	1
a	1
foundation	1
for	1
similar	1
claims	1
between	1
them	1
all.	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
heretofore	1
had	1
serious	1
and	1
animated	1
discussion	1
concerning	1
the	1
rights	1
to	1
the	1
lands	1
which	1
were	1
ungranted	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
Revolution,	1
and	1
which	1
usually	1
went	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
crown	1
lands.	1
The	1
States	1
within	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
whose	1
colonial	1
governments	1
they	1
were	1
comprised	1
have	1
claimed	1
them	1
as	1
their	1
property,	1
the	1
others	1
have	1
contended	1
that	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
crown	1
in	1
this	1
article	1
devolved	1
upon	1
the	1
Union;	1
especially	1
as	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Western	1
territory	1
which,	1
either	1
by	1
actual	1
possession,	1
or	1
through	1
the	1
submission	1
of	1
the	1
Indian	1
proprietors,	1
was	1
subjected	1
to	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
relinquished	1
in	1
the	1
treaty	1
of	1
peace.	1
This,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
was	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
an	1
acquisition	1
to	1
the	1
Confederacy	1
by	1
compact	1
with	1
a	1
foreign	1
power.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
prudent	1
policy	1
of	1
Congress	1
to	1
appease	1
this	1
controversy,	1
by	1
prevailing	1
upon	1
the	1
States	1
to	1
make	1
cessions	1
to	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
whole.	1
This	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
far	1
accomplished	1
as,	1
under	1
a	1
continuation	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
to	1
afford	1
a	1
decided	1
prospect	1
of	1
an	1
amicable	1
termination	1
of	1
the	1
dispute.	1
A	1
dismemberment	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy,	1
however,	1
would	1
revive	1
this	1
dispute,	1
and	1
would	1
create	1
others	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
subject.	1
At	1
present,	1
a	1
large	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
vacant	1
Western	1
territory	1
is,	1
by	1
cession	1
at	1
least,	1
if	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
anterior	1
right,	1
the	1
common	1
property	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
If	1
that	1
were	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
the	1
States	1
which	1
made	1
the	1
cession,	1
on	1
a	1
principle	1
of	1
federal	1
compromise,	1
would	1
be	1
apt	1
when	1
the	1
motive	1
of	1
the	1
grant	1
had	1
ceased,	1
to	1
reclaim	1
the	1
lands	1
as	1
a	1
reversion.	1
The	1
other	1
States	1
would	1
no	1
doubt	1
insist	1
on	1
a	1
proportion,	1
by	1
right	1
of	1
representation.	1
Their	1
argument	1
would	1
be,	1
that	1
a	1
grant,	1
once	1
made,	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
revoked;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
participating	1
in	1
territory	1
acquired	1
or	1
secured	1
by	1
the	1
joint	1
efforts	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy,	1
remained	1
undiminished.	1
If,	1
contrary	1
to	1
probability,	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
admitted	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
States,	1
that	1
each	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
a	1
share	1
of	1
this	1
common	1
stock,	1
there	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
a	1
difficulty	1
to	1
be	1
surmounted,	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
proper	1
rule	1
of	1
apportionment.	1
Different	1
principles	1
would	1
be	1
set	1
up	1
by	1
different	1
States	1
for	1
this	1
purpose;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
affect	1
the	1
opposite	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
parties,	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
easily	1
be	1
susceptible	1
of	1
a	1
pacific	1
adjustment.	1
In	1
the	1
wide	1
field	1
of	1
Western	1
territory,	1
therefore,	1
we	1
perceive	1
an	1
ample	1
theatre	1
for	1
hostile	1
pretensions,	1
without	1
any	1
umpire	1
or	1
common	1
judge	1
to	1
interpose	1
between	1
the	1
contending	1
parties.	1
To	1
reason	1
from	1
the	1
past	1
to	1
the	1
future,	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
good	1
ground	1
to	1
apprehend,	1
that	1
the	1
sword	1
would	1
sometimes	1
be	1
appealed	1
to	1
as	1
the	1
arbiter	1
of	1
their	1
differences.	1
The	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
dispute	1
between	1
Connecticut	1
and	1
Pennsylvania,	1
respecting	1
the	1
land	1
at	1
Wyoming,	1
admonish	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
sanguine	1
in	1
expecting	1
an	1
easy	1
accommodation	1
of	1
such	1
differences.	1
The	1
articles	1
of	1
confederation	1
obliged	1
the	1
parties	1
to	1
submit	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
decision	1
of	1
a	1
federal	1
court.	1
The	1
submission	1
was	1
made,	1
and	1
the	1
court	1
decided	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
Pennsylvania.	1
But	1
Connecticut	1
gave	1
strong	1
indications	1
of	1
dissatisfaction	1
with	1
that	1
determination;	1
nor	1
did	1
she	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
resigned	1
to	1
it,	1
till,	1
by	1
negotiation	1
and	1
management,	1
something	1
like	1
an	1
equivalent	1
was	1
found	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
she	1
supposed	1
herself	1
to	1
have	1
sustained.	1
Nothing	1
here	1
said	1
is	1
intended	1
to	1
convey	1
the	1
slightest	1
censure	1
on	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
that	1
State.	1
She	1
no	1
doubt	1
sincerely	1
believed	1
herself	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
injured	1
by	1
the	1
decision;	1
and	1
States,	1
like	1
individuals,	1
acquiesce	1
with	1
great	1
reluctance	1
in	1
determinations	1
to	1
their	1
disadvantage.	1
Those	1
who	1
had	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
seeing	1
the	1
inside	1
of	1
the	1
transactions	1
which	1
attended	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
controversy	1
between	1
this	1
State	1
and	1
the	1
district	1
of	1
Vermont,	1
can	1
vouch	1
the	1
opposition	1
we	1
experienced,	1
as	1
well	1
from	1
States	1
not	1
interested	1
as	1
from	1
those	1
which	1
were	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
claim;	1
and	1
can	1
attest	1
the	1
danger	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
exposed,	1
had	1
this	1
State	1
attempted	1
to	1
assert	1
its	1
rights	1
by	1
force.	1
Two	1
motives	1
preponderated	1
in	1
that	1
opposition:	1
one,	1
a	1
jealousy	1
entertained	1
of	1
our	1
future	1
power;	1
and	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
certain	1
individuals	1
of	1
influence	1
in	1
the	1
neighboring	1
States,	1
who	1
had	1
obtained	1
grants	1
of	1
lands	1
under	1
the	1
actual	1
government	1
of	1
that	1
district.	1
Even	1
the	1
States	1
which	1
brought	1
forward	1
claims,	1
in	1
contradiction	1
to	1
ours,	1
seemed	1
more	1
solicitous	1
to	1
dismember	1
this	1
State,	1
than	1
to	1
establish	1
their	1
own	1
pretensions.	1
These	1
were	1
New	1
Hampshire,	1
Massachusetts,	1
and	1
Connecticut.	1
New	1
Jersey	1
and	1
Rhode	1
Island,	1
upon	1
all	1
occasions,	1
discovered	1
a	1
warm	1
zeal	1
for	1
the	1
independence	1
of	1
Vermont;	1
and	1
Maryland,	1
till	1
alarmed	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
connection	1
between	1
Canada	1
and	1
that	1
State,	1
entered	1
deeply	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
views.	1
These	1
being	1
small	1
States,	1
saw	1
with	1
an	1
unfriendly	1
eye	1
the	1
perspective	1
of	1
our	1
growing	1
greatness.	1
In	1
a	1
review	1
of	1
these	1
transactions	1
we	1
may	1
trace	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
causes	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
embroil	1
the	1
States	1
with	1
each	1
other,	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
their	1
unpropitious	1
destiny	1
to	1
become	1
disunited.	1
The	1
competitions	1
of	1
commerce	1
would	1
be	1
another	1
fruitful	1
source	1
of	1
contention.	1
The	1
States	1
less	1
favorably	1
circumstanced	1
would	1
be	1
desirous	1
of	1
escaping	1
from	1
the	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
local	1
situation,	1
and	1
of	1
sharing	1
in	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
their	1
more	1
fortunate	1
neighbors.	1
Each	1
State,	1
or	1
separate	1
confederacy,	1
would	1
pursue	1
a	1
system	1
of	1
commercial	1
policy	1
peculiar	1
to	1
itself.	1
This	1
would	1
occasion	1
distinctions,	1
preferences,	1
and	1
exclusions,	1
which	1
would	1
beget	1
discontent.	1
The	1
habits	1
of	1
intercourse,	1
on	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
equal	1
privileges,	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
accustomed	1
since	1
the	1
earliest	1
settlement	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
would	1
give	1
a	1
keener	1
edge	1
to	1
those	1
causes	1
of	1
discontent	1
than	1
they	1
would	1
naturally	1
have	1
independent	1
of	1
this	1
circumstance.	1
WE	1
SHOULD	1
BE	1
READY	1
TO	1
DENOMINATE	1
INJURIES	1
THOSE	1
THINGS	1
WHICH	1
WERE	1
IN	1
REALITY	1
THE	1
JUSTIFIABLE	1
ACTS	1
OF	1
INDEPENDENT	1
SOVEREIGNTIES	1
CONSULTING	1
A	1
DISTINCT	1
INTEREST.	1
The	1
spirit	1
of	1
enterprise,	1
which	1
characterizes	1
the	1
commercial	1
part	1
of	1
America,	1
has	1
left	1
no	1
occasion	1
of	1
displaying	1
itself	1
unimproved.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
probable	1
that	1
this	1
unbridled	1
spirit	1
would	1
pay	1
much	1
respect	1
to	1
those	1
regulations	1
of	1
trade	1
by	1
which	1
particular	1
States	1
might	1
endeavor	1
to	1
secure	1
exclusive	1
benefits	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
citizens.	1
The	1
infractions	1
of	1
these	1
regulations,	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
the	1
efforts	1
to	1
prevent	1
and	1
repel	1
them,	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
would	1
naturally	1
lead	1
to	1
outrages,	1
and	1
these	1
to	1
reprisals	1
and	1
wars.	1
The	1
opportunities	1
which	1
some	1
States	1
would	1
have	1
of	1
rendering	1
others	1
tributary	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
commercial	1
regulations	1
would	1
be	1
impatiently	1
submitted	1
to	1
by	1
the	1
tributary	1
States.	1
The	1
relative	1
situation	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
Connecticut,	1
and	1
New	1
Jersey	1
would	1
afford	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
this	1
kind.	1
New	1
York,	1
from	1
the	1
necessities	1
of	1
revenue,	1
must	1
lay	1
duties	1
on	1
her	1
importations.	1
A	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
these	1
duties	1
must	1
be	1
paid	1
by	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
other	1
States	1
in	1
the	1
capacity	1
of	1
consumers	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
import.	1
New	1
York	1
would	1
neither	1
be	1
willing	1
nor	1
able	1
to	1
forego	1
this	1
advantage.	1
Her	1
citizens	1
would	1
not	1
consent	1
that	1
a	1
duty	1
paid	1
by	1
them	1
should	1
be	1
remitted	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
her	1
neighbors;	1
nor	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
practicable,	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
this	1
impediment	1
in	1
the	1
way,	1
to	1
distinguish	1
the	1
customers	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
markets.	1
Would	1
Connecticut	1
and	1
New	1
Jersey	1
long	1
submit	1
to	1
be	1
taxed	1
by	1
New	1
York	1
for	1
her	1
exclusive	1
benefit?	1
Should	1
we	1
be	1
long	1
permitted	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
quiet	1
and	1
undisturbed	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
a	1
metropolis,	1
from	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
derived	1
an	1
advantage	1
so	1
odious	1
to	1
our	1
neighbors,	1
and,	1
in	1
their	1
opinion,	1
so	1
oppressive?	1
Should	1
we	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
preserve	1
it	1
against	1
the	1
incumbent	1
weight	1
of	1
Connecticut	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
co-operating	1
pressure	1
of	1
New	1
Jersey	1
on	1
the	1
other?	1
These	1
are	1
questions	1
that	1
temerity	1
alone	1
will	1
answer	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative.	1
The	1
public	1
debt	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
further	1
cause	1
of	1
collision	1
between	1
the	1
separate	1
States	1
or	1
confederacies.	1
The	1
apportionment,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance,	1
and	1
the	1
progressive	1
extinguishment	1
afterward,	1
would	1
be	1
alike	1
productive	1
of	1
ill-humor	1
and	1
animosity.	1
How	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
possible	1
to	1
agree	1
upon	1
a	1
rule	1
of	1
apportionment	1
satisfactory	1
to	1
all?	1
There	1
is	1
scarcely	1
any	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
proposed	1
which	1
is	1
entirely	1
free	1
from	1
real	1
objections.	1
These,	1
as	1
usual,	1
would	1
be	1
exaggerated	1
by	1
the	1
adverse	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
parties.	1
There	1
are	1
even	1
dissimilar	1
views	1
among	1
the	1
States	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
principle	1
of	1
discharging	1
the	1
public	1
debt.	1
Some	1
of	1
them,	1
either	1
less	1
impressed	1
with	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
national	1
credit,	1
or	1
because	1
their	1
citizens	1
have	1
little,	1
if	1
any,	1
immediate	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
question,	1
feel	1
an	1
indifference,	1
if	1
not	1
a	1
repugnance,	1
to	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
the	1
domestic	1
debt	1
at	1
any	1
rate.	1
These	1
would	1
be	1
inclined	1
to	1
magnify	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
a	1
distribution.	1
Others	1
of	1
them,	1
a	1
numerous	1
body	1
of	1
whose	1
citizens	1
are	1
creditors	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
beyond	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
in	1
the	1
total	1
amount	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
debt,	1
would	1
be	1
strenuous	1
for	1
some	1
equitable	1
and	1
effective	1
provision.	1
The	1
procrastinations	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
would	1
excite	1
the	1
resentments	1
of	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
settlement	1
of	1
a	1
rule	1
would,	1
in	1
the	1
meantime,	1
be	1
postponed	1
by	1
real	1
differences	1
of	1
opinion	1
and	1
affected	1
delays.	1
The	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
interested	1
would	1
clamour;	1
foreign	1
powers	1
would	1
urge	1
for	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
their	1
just	1
demands,	1
and	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
would	1
be	1
hazarded	1
to	1
the	1
double	1
contingency	1
of	1
external	1
invasion	1
and	1
internal	1
contention.	1
Suppose	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
agreeing	1
upon	1
a	1
rule	1
surmounted,	1
and	1
the	1
apportionment	1
made.	1
Still	1
there	1
is	1
great	1
room	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
rule	1
agreed	1
upon	1
would,	1
upon	1
experiment,	1
be	1
found	1
to	1
bear	1
harder	1
upon	1
some	1
States	1
than	1
upon	1
others.	1
Those	1
which	1
were	1
sufferers	1
by	1
it	1
would	1
naturally	1
seek	1
for	1
a	1
mitigation	1
of	1
the	1
burden.	1
The	1
others	1
would	1
as	1
naturally	1
be	1
disinclined	1
to	1
a	1
revision,	1
which	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
end	1
in	1
an	1
increase	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
incumbrances.	1
Their	1
refusal	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
plausible	1
a	1
pretext	1
to	1
the	1
complaining	1
States	1
to	1
withhold	1
their	1
contributions,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
embraced	1
with	1
avidity;	1
and	1
the	1
non-compliance	1
of	1
these	1
States	1
with	1
their	1
engagements	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
ground	1
of	1
bitter	1
discussion	1
and	1
altercation.	1
If	1
even	1
the	1
rule	1
adopted	1
should	1
in	1
practice	1
justify	1
the	1
equality	1
of	1
its	1
principle,	1
still	1
delinquencies	1
in	1
payments	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
would	1
result	1
from	1
a	1
diversity	1
of	1
other	1
causes--the	1
real	1
deficiency	1
of	1
resources;	1
the	1
mismanagement	1
of	1
their	1
finances;	1
accidental	1
disorders	1
in	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
government;	1
and,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
rest,	1
the	1
reluctance	1
with	1
which	1
men	1
commonly	1
part	1
with	1
money	1
for	1
purposes	1
that	1
have	1
outlived	1
the	1
exigencies	1
which	1
produced	1
them,	1
and	1
interfere	1
with	1
the	1
supply	1
of	1
immediate	1
wants.	1
Delinquencies,	1
from	1
whatever	1
causes,	1
would	1
be	1
productive	1
of	1
complaints,	1
recriminations,	1
and	1
quarrels.	1
There	1
is,	1
perhaps,	1
nothing	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
nations	1
than	1
their	1
being	1
bound	1
to	1
mutual	1
contributions	1
for	1
any	1
common	1
object	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
yield	1
an	1
equal	1
and	1
coincident	1
benefit.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
observation,	1
as	1
true	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
trite,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
men	1
differ	1
so	1
readily	1
about	1
as	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
money.	1
Laws	1
in	1
violation	1
of	1
private	1
contracts,	1
as	1
they	1
amount	1
to	1
aggressions	1
on	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
those	1
States	1
whose	1
citizens	1
are	1
injured	1
by	1
them,	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
another	1
probable	1
source	1
of	1
hostility.	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
authorized	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
a	1
more	1
liberal	1
or	1
more	1
equitable	1
spirit	1
would	1
preside	1
over	1
the	1
legislations	1
of	1
the	1
individual	1
States	1
hereafter,	1
if	1
unrestrained	1
by	1
any	1
additional	1
checks,	1
than	1
we	1
have	1
heretofore	1
seen	1
in	1
too	1
many	1
instances	1
disgracing	1
their	1
several	1
codes.	1
We	1
have	1
observed	1
the	1
disposition	1
to	1
retaliation	1
excited	1
in	1
Connecticut	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
enormities	1
perpetrated	1
by	1
the	1
Legislature	1
of	1
Rhode	1
Island;	1
and	1
we	1
reasonably	1
infer	1
that,	1
in	1
similar	1
cases,	1
under	1
other	1
circumstances,	1
a	1
war,	1
not	1
of	1
PARCHMENT,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
would	1
chastise	1
such	1
atrocious	1
breaches	1
of	1
moral	1
obligation	1
and	1
social	1
justice.	1
The	1
probability	1
of	1
incompatible	1
alliances	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
States	1
or	1
confederacies	1
and	1
different	1
foreign	1
nations,	1
and	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
this	1
situation	1
upon	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
whole,	1
have	1
been	1
sufficiently	1
unfolded	1
in	1
some	1
preceding	1
papers.	1
From	1
the	1
view	1
they	1
have	1
exhibited	1
of	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
subject,	1
this	1
conclusion	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
drawn,	1
that	1
America,	1
if	1
not	1
connected	1
at	1
all,	1
or	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
feeble	1
tie	1
of	1
a	1
simple	1
league,	1
offensive	1
and	1
defensive,	1
would,	1
by	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
such	1
jarring	1
alliances,	1
be	1
gradually	1
entangled	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
pernicious	1
labyrinths	1
of	1
European	1
politics	1
and	1
wars;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
destructive	1
contentions	1
of	1
the	1
parts	1
into	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
divided,	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
prey	1

the	1

ASSUMING	1
it	1
therefore	1
as	1
an	1
established	1
truth	1
that	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
disunion,	1
or	1
such	1
combinations	1

might	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
formed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wreck	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
Confederacy,	1
would	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
those	1
vicissitudes	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
war,	1
of	1
friendship	1
and	1
enmity,	1
with	1
each	1
other,	1
which	1
have	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
all	1
neighboring	1
nations	1
not	1
united	1
under	1
one	1
government,	1
let	1
us	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
concise	1
detail	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
consequences	1
that	1
would	1
attend	1
such	1
a	1
situation.	1
War	1
between	1
the	1
States,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
period	1
of	1
their	1
separate	1
existence,	1
would	1
be	1
accompanied	1
with	1
much	1
greater	1
distresses	1
than	1
it	1
commonly	1
is	1
in	1
those	1
countries	1
where	1
regular	1
military	1
establishments	1
have	1
long	1
obtained.	1
The	1
disciplined	1
armies	1
always	1
kept	1
on	1
foot	1
on	1
the	1
continent	1
of	1
Europe,	1
though	1
they	1
bear	1
a	1
malignant	1
aspect	1
to	1
liberty	1
and	1
economy,	1
have,	1
notwithstanding,	1
been	1
productive	1
of	1
the	1
signal	1
advantage	1
of	1
rendering	1
sudden	1
conquests	1
impracticable,	1
and	1
of	1
preventing	1
that	1
rapid	1
desolation	1
which	1
used	1
to	1
mark	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
war	1
prior	1
to	1
their	1
introduction.	1
The	1
art	1
of	1
fortification	1
has	1
contributed	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
ends.	1
The	1
nations	1
of	1
Europe	1
are	1
encircled	1
with	1
chains	1
of	1
fortified	1
places,	1
which	1
mutually	1
obstruct	1
invasion.	1
Campaigns	1
are	1
wasted	1
in	1
reducing	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
frontier	1
garrisons,	1
to	1
gain	1
admittance	1
into	1
an	1
enemy's	1
country.	1
Similar	1
impediments	1
occur	1
at	1
every	1
step,	1
to	1
exhaust	1
the	1
strength	1
and	1
delay	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
an	1
invader.	1
Formerly,	1
an	1
invading	1
army	1
would	1
penetrate	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
neighboring	1
country	1
almost	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
intelligence	1
of	1
its	1
approach	1
could	1
be	1
received;	1
but	1
now	1
a	1
comparatively	1
small	1
force	1
of	1
disciplined	1
troops,	1
acting	1
on	1
the	1
defensive,	1
with	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
posts,	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
impede,	1
and	1
finally	1
to	1
frustrate,	1
the	1
enterprises	1
of	1
one	1
much	1
more	1
considerable.	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
war,	1
in	1
that	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
globe,	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
nations	1
subdued	1
and	1
empires	1
overturned,	1
but	1
of	1
towns	1
taken	1
and	1
retaken;	1
of	1
battles	1
that	1
decide	1
nothing;	1
of	1
retreats	1
more	1
beneficial	1
than	1
victories;	1
of	1
much	1
effort	1
and	1
little	1
acquisition.	1
In	1
this	1
country	1
the	1
scene	1
would	1
be	1
altogether	1
reversed.	1
The	1
jealousy	1
of	1
military	1
establishments	1
would	1
postpone	1
them	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
possible.	1
The	1
want	1
of	1
fortifications,	1
leaving	1
the	1
frontiers	1
of	1
one	1
state	1
open	1
to	1
another,	1
would	1
facilitate	1
inroads.	1
The	1
populous	1
States	1
would,	1
with	1
little	1
difficulty,	1
overrun	1
their	1
less	1
populous	1
neighbors.	1
Conquests	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
as	1
difficult	1
to	1
be	1
retained.	1
War,	1
therefore,	1
would	1
be	1
desultory	1
and	1
predatory.	1
PLUNDER	1
and	1
devastation	1
ever	1
march	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
irregulars.	1
The	1
calamities	1
of	1
individuals	1
would	1
make	1
the	1
principal	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
events	1
which	1
would	1
characterize	1
our	1
military	1
exploits.	1
This	1
picture	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
highly	1
wrought;	1
though,	1
I	1
confess,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
long	1
remain	1
a	1
just	1
one.	1
Safety	1
from	1
external	1
danger	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
director	1
of	1
national	1
conduct.	1
Even	1
the	1
ardent	1
love	1
of	1
liberty	1
will,	1
after	1
a	1
time,	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
its	1
dictates.	1
The	1
violent	1
destruction	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
property	1
incident	1
to	1
war,	1
the	1
continual	1
effort	1
and	1
alarm	1
attendant	1
on	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
continual	1
danger,	1
will	1
compel	1
nations	1
the	1
most	1
attached	1
to	1
liberty	1
to	1
resort	1
for	1
repose	1
and	1
security	1
to	1
institutions	1
which	1
have	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
destroy	1
their	1
civil	1
and	1
political	1
rights.	1
To	1
be	1
more	1
safe,	1
they	1
at	1
length	1
become	1
willing	1
to	1
run	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
being	1
less	1
free.	1
The	1
institutions	1
chiefly	1
alluded	1
to	1
are	1
STANDING	1
ARMIES	1
and	1
the	1
correspondent	1
appendages	1
of	1
military	1
establishments.	1
Standing	1
armies,	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
are	1
not	1
provided	1
against	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
therefore	1
inferred	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
exist	1
under	1
it.1	1
Their	1
existence,	1
however,	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
proposition,	1
is,	1
at	1
most,	1
problematical	1
and	1
uncertain.	1
But	1
standing	1
armies,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
replied,	1
must	1
inevitably	1
result	1
from	1
a	1
dissolution	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy.	1
Frequent	1
war	1
and	1
constant	1
apprehension,	1
which	1
require	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
as	1
constant	1
preparation,	1
will	1
infallibly	1
produce	1
them.	1
The	1
weaker	1
States	1
or	1
confederacies	1
would	1
first	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
them,	1
to	1
put	1
themselves	1
upon	1
an	1
equality	1
with	1
their	1
more	1
potent	1
neighbors.	1
They	1
would	1
endeavor	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
inferiority	1
of	1
population	1
and	1
resources	1
by	1
a	1
more	1
regular	1
and	1
effective	1
system	1
of	1
defense,	1
by	1
disciplined	1
troops,	1
and	1
by	1
fortifications.	1
They	1
would,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
be	1
necessitated	1
to	1
strengthen	1
the	1
executive	1
arm	1
of	1
government,	1
in	1
doing	1
which	1
their	1
constitutions	1
would	1
acquire	1
a	1
progressive	1
direction	1
toward	1
monarchy.	1
It	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
war	1
to	1
increase	1
the	1
executive	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority.	1
The	1
expedients	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
mentioned	1
would	1
soon	1
give	1
the	1
States	1
or	1
confederacies	1
that	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
superiority	1
over	1
their	1
neighbors.	1
Small	1
states,	1
or	1
states	1
of	1
less	1
natural	1
strength,	1
under	1
vigorous	1
governments,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
disciplined	1
armies,	1
have	1
often	1
triumphed	1
over	1
large	1
states,	1
or	1
states	1
of	1
greater	1
natural	1
strength,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
destitute	1
of	1
these	1
advantages.	1
Neither	1
the	1
pride	1
nor	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
important	1
States	1
or	1
confederacies	1
would	1
permit	1
them	1
long	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
this	1
mortifying	1
and	1
adventitious	1
superiority.	1
They	1
would	1
quickly	1
resort	1
to	1
means	1
similar	1
to	1
those	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
effected,	1
to	1
reinstate	1
themselves	1
in	1
their	1
lost	1
pre-eminence.	1
Thus,	1
we	1
should,	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
time,	1
see	1
established	1
in	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
country	1
the	1
same	1
engines	1
of	1
despotism	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
scourge	1
of	1
the	1
Old	1
World.	1
This,	1
at	1
least,	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
natural	1
course	1
of	1
things;	1
and	1
our	1
reasonings	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
just,	1
in	1
proportion	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
accommodated	1
to	1
this	1
standard.	1
These	1
are	1
not	1
vague	1
inferences	1
drawn	1
from	1
supposed	1
or	1
speculative	1
defects	1
in	1
a	1
Constitution,	1
the	1
whole	1
power	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
people,	1
or	1
their	1
representatives	1
and	1
delegates,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
solid	1
conclusions,	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
natural	1
and	1
necessary	1
progress	1
of	1
human	1
affairs.	1
It	1
may,	1
perhaps,	1
be	1
asked,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
objection	1
to	1
this,	1
why	1
did	1
not	1
standing	1
armies	1
spring	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
contentions	1
which	1
so	1
often	1
distracted	1
the	1
ancient	1
republics	1
of	1
Greece?	1
Different	1
answers,	1
equally	1
satisfactory,	1
may	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
this	1
question.	1
The	1
industrious	1
habits	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
day,	1
absorbed	1
in	1
the	1
pursuits	1
of	1
gain,	1
and	1
devoted	1
to	1
the	1
improvements	1
of	1
agriculture	1
and	1
commerce,	1
are	1
incompatible	1
with	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
a	1
nation	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
true	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
those	1
republics.	1
The	1
means	1
of	1
revenue,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
greatly	1
multiplied	1
by	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
arts	1
of	1
industry,	1
and	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
finance,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
modern	1
times,	1
concurring	1
with	1
the	1
habits	1
of	1
nations,	1
have	1
produced	1
an	1
entire	1
revolution	1
in	1
the	1
system	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
have	1
rendered	1
disciplined	1
armies,	1
distinct	1
from	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
citizens,	1
the	1
inseparable	1
companions	1
of	1
frequent	1
hostility.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
wide	1
difference,	1
also,	1
between	1
military	1
establishments	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
seldom	1
exposed	1
by	1
its	1
situation	1
to	1
internal	1
invasions,	1
and	1
in	1
one	1
which	1
is	1
often	1
subject	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
always	1
apprehensive	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
can	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
pretext,	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
even	1
so	1
inclined,	1
to	1
keep	1
on	1
foot	1
armies	1
so	1
numerous	1
as	1
must	1
of	1
necessity	1
be	1
maintained	1
in	1
the	1
latter.	1
These	1
armies	1
being,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
case,	1
rarely,	1
if	1
at	1
all,	1
called	1
into	1
activity	1
for	1
interior	1
defense,	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
in	1
no	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
broken	1
to	1
military	1
subordination.	1
The	1
laws	1
are	1
not	1
accustomed	1
to	1
relaxations,	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
military	1
exigencies;	1
the	1
civil	1
state	1
remains	1
in	1
full	1
vigor,	1
neither	1
corrupted,	1
nor	1
confounded	1
with	1
the	1
principles	1
or	1
propensities	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
state.	1
The	1
smallness	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
renders	1
the	1
natural	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
an	1
over-match	1
for	1
it;	1
and	1
the	1
citizens,	1
not	1
habituated	1
to	1
look	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
military	1
power	1
for	1
protection,	1
or	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
its	1
oppressions,	1
neither	1
love	1
nor	1
fear	1
the	1
soldiery;	1
they	1
view	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
jealous	1
acquiescence	1
in	1
a	1
necessary	1
evil,	1
and	1
stand	1
ready	1
to	1
resist	1
a	1
power	1
which	1
they	1
suppose	1
may	1
be	1
exerted	1
to	1
the	1
prejudice	1
of	1
their	1
rights.	1
The	1
army	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances	1
may	1
usefully	1
aid	1
the	1
magistrate	1
to	1
suppress	1
a	1
small	1
faction,	1
or	1
an	1
occasional	1
mob,	1
or	1
insurrection;	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
enforce	1
encroachments	1
against	1
the	1
united	1
efforts	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
In	1
a	1
country	1
in	1
the	1
predicament	1
last	1
described,	1
the	1
contrary	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
happens.	1
The	1
perpetual	1
menacings	1
of	1
danger	1
oblige	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
prepared	1
to	1
repel	1
it;	1
its	1
armies	1
must	1
be	1
numerous	1
enough	1
for	1
instant	1
defense.	1
The	1
continual	1
necessity	1
for	1
their	1
services	1
enhances	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
soldier,	1
and	1
proportionably	1
degrades	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
citizen.	1
The	1
military	1
state	1
becomes	1
elevated	1
above	1
the	1
civil.	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
territories,	1
often	1
the	1
theatre	1
of	1
war,	1
are	1
unavoidably	1
subjected	1
to	1
frequent	1
infringements	1
on	1
their	1
rights,	1
which	1
serve	1
to	1
weaken	1
their	1
sense	1
of	1
those	1
rights;	1
and	1
by	1
degrees	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
brought	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
soldiery	1
not	1
only	1
as	1
their	1
protectors,	1
but	1
as	1
their	1
superiors.	1
The	1
transition	1
from	1
this	1
disposition	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
considering	1
them	1
masters,	1
is	1
neither	1
remote	1
nor	1
difficult;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
difficult	1
to	1
prevail	1
upon	1
a	1
people	1
under	1
such	1
impressions,	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
bold	1
or	1
effectual	1
resistance	1
to	1
usurpations	1
supported	1
by	1
the	1
military	1
power.	1
The	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
falls	1
within	1
the	1
first	1
description.	1
An	1
insular	1
situation,	1
and	1
a	1
powerful	1
marine,	1
guarding	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure	1
against	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
foreign	1
invasion,	1
supersede	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
numerous	1
army	1
within	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
A	1
sufficient	1
force	1
to	1
make	1
head	1
against	1
a	1
sudden	1
descent,	1
till	1
the	1
militia	1
could	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
rally	1
and	1
embody,	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
deemed	1
requisite.	1
No	1
motive	1
of	1
national	1
policy	1
has	1
demanded,	1
nor	1
would	1
public	1
opinion	1
have	1
tolerated,	1
a	1
larger	1
number	1
of	1
troops	1
upon	1
its	1
domestic	1
establishment.	1
There	1
has	1
been,	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
past,	1
little	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
causes,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
enumerated	1
as	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
internal	1
war.	1
This	1
peculiar	1
felicity	1
of	1
situation	1
has,	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
degree,	1
contributed	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
liberty	1
which	1
that	1
country	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
enjoys,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
prevalent	1
venality	1
and	1
corruption.	1
If,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
Britain	1
had	1
been	1
situated	1
on	1
the	1
continent,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
compelled,	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been,	1
by	1
that	1
situation,	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
military	1
establishments	1
at	1
home	1
coextensive	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
great	1
powers	1
of	1
Europe,	1
she,	1
like	1
them,	1
would	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
be,	1
at	1
this	1
day,	1
a	1
victim	1
to	1
the	1
absolute	1
power	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
man.	1
'T	1
is	1
possible,	1
though	1
not	1
easy,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
that	1
island	1
may	1
be	1
enslaved	1
from	1
other	1
causes;	1
but	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
by	1
the	1
prowess	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
so	1
inconsiderable	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
usually	1
kept	1
up	1
within	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
If	1
we	1
are	1
wise	1
enough	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
Union	1
we	1
may	1
for	1
ages	1
enjoy	1
an	1
advantage	1
similar	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
an	1
insulated	1
situation.	1
Europe	1
is	1
at	1
a	1
great	1
distance	1
from	1
us.	1
Her	1
colonies	1
in	1
our	1
vicinity	1
will	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
continue	1
too	1
much	1
disproportioned	1
in	1
strength	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
any	1
dangerous	1
annoyance.	1
Extensive	1
military	1
establishments	1
cannot,	1
in	1
this	1
position,	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
our	1
security.	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
disunited,	1
and	1
the	1
integral	1
parts	1
should	1
either	1
remain	1
separated,	1
or,	1
which	1
is	1
most	1
probable,	1
should	1
be	1
thrown	1
together	1
into	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
confederacies,	1
we	1
should	1
be,	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
course	1
of	1
time,	1
in	1
the	1
predicament	1
of	1
the	1
continental	1
powers	1
of	1
Europe	1
--our	1
liberties	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
prey	1
to	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
defending	1
ourselves	1
against	1
the	1
ambition	1
and	1
jealousy	1
of	1
each	1
other.	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
idea	1
not	1
superficial	1
or	1
futile,	1
but	1
solid	1
and	1
weighty.	1
It	1
deserves	1
the	1
most	1
serious	1
and	1
mature	1
consideration	1
of	1
every	1
prudent	1
and	1
honest	1
man	1
of	1
whatever	1
party.	1
If	1
such	1
men	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
firm	1
and	1
solemn	1
pause,	1
and	1
meditate	1
dispassionately	1
on	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
this	1
interesting	1
idea;	1
if	1
they	1
will	1
contemplate	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
attitudes,	1
and	1
trace	1
it	1
to	1
all	1
its	1
consequences,	1

will	1
not	1

to	1
part	1
with	1
trivial	1
objections	1
to	1
a	1

the	1
rejection	1
of	1
which	1
would	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
put	1
a	1
final	1
period	1
to	1
the	1
Union.	1
The	1
airy	1
phantoms	1
that	1
flit	1
before	1
the	1
distempered	1
imaginations	1

some	1
of	1

quickly	1
give	1
place	1
to	1
the	1

To	1

A	1
FIRM	1
Union	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
moment	1
to	1
the	1
peace	1
and	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
as	1
a	1
barrier	1
against	1
domestic	1
faction	1
and	1
insurrection.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
petty	1
republics	1
of	1
Greece	1
and	1
Italy	1
without	1
feeling	1
sensations	1
of	1
horror	1
and	1
disgust	1
at	1
the	1
distractions	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
continually	1
agitated,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
rapid	1
succession	1
of	1
revolutions	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
kept	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
perpetual	1
vibration	1
between	1
the	1
extremes	1
of	1
tyranny	1
and	1
anarchy.	1
If	1
they	1
exhibit	1
occasional	1
calms,	1
these	1
only	1
serve	1
as	1
short-lived	1
contrast	1
to	1
the	1
furious	1
storms	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
succeed.	1
If	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
intervals	1
of	1
felicity	1
open	1
to	1
view,	1
we	1
behold	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
regret,	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
the	1
pleasing	1
scenes	1
before	1
us	1
are	1
soon	1
to	1
be	1
overwhelmed	1
by	1
the	1
tempestuous	1
waves	1
of	1
sedition	1
and	1
party	1
rage.	1
If	1
momentary	1
rays	1
of	1
glory	1
break	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
gloom,	1
while	1
they	1
dazzle	1
us	1
with	1
a	1
transient	1
and	1
fleeting	1
brilliancy,	1
they	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
admonish	1
us	1
to	1
lament	1
that	1
the	1
vices	1
of	1
government	1
should	1
pervert	1
the	1
direction	1
and	1
tarnish	1
the	1
lustre	1
of	1
those	1
bright	1
talents	1
and	1
exalted	1
endowments	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
favored	1
soils	1
that	1
produced	1
them	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
justly	1
celebrated.	1
From	1
the	1
disorders	1
that	1
disfigure	1
the	1
annals	1
of	1
those	1
republics	1
the	1
advocates	1
of	1
despotism	1
have	1
drawn	1
arguments,	1
not	1
only	1
against	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
republican	1
government,	1
but	1
against	1
the	1
very	1
principles	1
of	1
civil	1
liberty.	1
They	1
have	1
decried	1
all	1
free	1
government	1
as	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
society,	1
and	1
have	1
indulged	1
themselves	1
in	1
malicious	1
exultation	1
over	1
its	1
friends	1
and	1
partisans.	1
Happily	1
for	1
mankind,	1
stupendous	1
fabrics	1
reared	1
on	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
liberty,	1
which	1
have	1
flourished	1
for	1
ages,	1
have,	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
glorious	1
instances,	1
refuted	1
their	1
gloomy	1
sophisms.	1
And,	1
I	1
trust,	1
America	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
broad	1
and	1
solid	1
foundation	1
of	1
other	1
edifices,	1
not	1
less	1
magnificent,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
equally	1
permanent	1
monuments	1
of	1
their	1
errors.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
denied	1
that	1
the	1
portraits	1
they	1
have	1
sketched	1
of	1
republican	1
government	1
were	1
too	1
just	1
copies	1
of	1
the	1
originals	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
taken.	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
impracticable	1
to	1
have	1
devised	1
models	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
perfect	1
structure,	1
the	1
enlightened	1
friends	1
to	1
liberty	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
abandon	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
that	1
species	1
of	1
government	1
as	1
indefensible.	1
The	1
science	1
of	1
politics,	1
however,	1
like	1
most	1
other	1
sciences,	1
has	1
received	1
great	1
improvement.	1
The	1
efficacy	1
of	1
various	1
principles	1
is	1
now	1
well	1
understood,	1
which	1
were	1
either	1
not	1
known	1
at	1
all,	1
or	1
imperfectly	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
ancients.	1
The	1
regular	1
distribution	1
of	1
power	1
into	1
distinct	1
departments;	1
the	1
introduction	1
of	1
legislative	1
balances	1
and	1
checks;	1
the	1
institution	1
of	1
courts	1
composed	1
of	1
judges	1
holding	1
their	1
offices	1
during	1
good	1
behavior;	1
the	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
legislature	1
by	1
deputies	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
election:	1
these	1
are	1
wholly	1
new	1
discoveries,	1
or	1
have	1
made	1
their	1
principal	1
progress	1
towards	1
perfection	1
in	1
modern	1
times.	1
They	1
are	1
means,	1
and	1
powerful	1
means,	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
excellences	1
of	1
republican	1
government	1
may	1
be	1
retained	1
and	1
its	1
imperfections	1
lessened	1
or	1
avoided.	1
To	1
this	1
catalogue	1
of	1
circumstances	1
that	1
tend	1
to	1
the	1
amelioration	1
of	1
popular	1
systems	1
of	1
civil	1
government,	1
I	1
shall	1
venture,	1
however	1
novel	1
it	1
may	1
appear	1
to	1
some,	1
to	1
add	1
one	1
more,	1
on	1
a	1
principle	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
an	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution;	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
ENLARGEMENT	1
of	1
the	1
ORBIT	1
within	1
which	1
such	1
systems	1
are	1
to	1
revolve,	1
either	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
dimensions	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
State	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
consolidation	1
of	1
several	1
smaller	1
States	1
into	1
one	1
great	1
Confederacy.	1
The	1
latter	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
immediately	1
concerns	1
the	1
object	1
under	1
consideration.	1
It	1
will,	1
however,	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
principle	1
in	1
its	1
application	1
to	1
a	1
single	1
State,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
attended	1
to	1
in	1
another	1
place.	1
The	1
utility	1
of	1
a	1
Confederacy,	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
suppress	1
faction	1
and	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
internal	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
States,	1
as	1
to	1
increase	1
their	1
external	1
force	1
and	1
security,	1
is	1
in	1
reality	1
not	1
a	1
new	1
idea.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
practiced	1
upon	1
in	1
different	1
countries	1
and	1
ages,	1
and	1
has	1
received	1
the	1
sanction	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
approved	1
writers	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
politics.	1
The	1
opponents	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
proposed	1
have,	1
with	1
great	1
assiduity,	1
cited	1
and	1
circulated	1
the	1
observations	1
of	1
Montesquieu	1
on	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
contracted	1
territory	1
for	1
a	1
republican	1
government.	1
But	1
they	1
seem	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
apprised	1
of	1
the	1
sentiments	1
of	1
that	1
great	1
man	1
expressed	1
in	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
work,	1
nor	1
to	1
have	1
adverted	1
to	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
the	1
principle	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
subscribe	1
with	1
such	1
ready	1
acquiescence.	1
When	1
Montesquieu	1
recommends	1
a	1
small	1
extent	1
for	1
republics,	1
the	1
standards	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
view	1
were	1
of	1
dimensions	1
far	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
almost	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
States.	1
Neither	1
Virginia,	1
Massachusetts,	1
Pennsylvania,	1
New	1
York,	1
North	1
Carolina,	1
nor	1
Georgia	1
can	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
models	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
reasoned	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
his	1
description	1
apply.	1
If	1
we	1
therefore	1
take	1
his	1
ideas	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
as	1
the	1
criterion	1
of	1
truth,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
driven	1
to	1
the	1
alternative	1
either	1
of	1
taking	1
refuge	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
monarchy,	1
or	1
of	1
splitting	1
ourselves	1
into	1
an	1
infinity	1
of	1
little,	1
jealous,	1
clashing,	1
tumultuous	1
commonwealths,	1
the	1
wretched	1
nurseries	1
of	1
unceasing	1
discord,	1
and	1
the	1
miserable	1
objects	1
of	1
universal	1
pity	1
or	1
contempt.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
writers	1
who	1
have	1
come	1
forward	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
dilemma;	1
and	1
have	1
even	1
been	1
bold	1
enough	1
to	1
hint	1
at	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
larger	1
States	1
as	1
a	1
desirable	1
thing.	1
Such	1
an	1
infatuated	1
policy,	1
such	1
a	1
desperate	1
expedient,	1
might,	1
by	1
the	1
multiplication	1
of	1
petty	1
offices,	1
answer	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
possess	1
not	1
qualifications	1
to	1
extend	1
their	1
influence	1
beyond	1
the	1
narrow	1
circles	1
of	1
personal	1
intrigue,	1
but	1
it	1
could	1
never	1
promote	1
the	1
greatness	1
or	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America.	1
Referring	1
the	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
principle	1
itself	1
to	1
another	1
place,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
remark	1
here	1
that,	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
author	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
most	1
emphatically	1
quoted	1
upon	1
the	1
occasion,	1
it	1
would	1
only	1
dictate	1
a	1
reduction	1
of	1
the	1
SIZE	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
considerable	1
MEMBERS	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
but	1
would	1
not	1
militate	1
against	1
their	1
being	1
all	1
comprehended	1
in	1
one	1
confederate	1
government.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
question,	1
in	1
the	1
discussion	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
at	1
present	1
interested.	1
So	1
far	1
are	1
the	1
suggestions	1
of	1
Montesquieu	1
from	1
standing	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
Union	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
that	1
he	1
explicitly	1
treats	1
of	1
a	1
CONFEDERATE	1
REPUBLIC	1
as	1
the	1
expedient	1
for	1
extending	1
the	1
sphere	1
of	1
popular	1
government,	1
and	1
reconciling	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
monarchy	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
republicanism.	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
probable,"	1
(says	1
he1)	1
"that	1
mankind	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
obliged	1
at	1
length	1
to	1
live	1
constantly	1
under	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
person,	1
had	1
they	1
not	1
contrived	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
constitution	1
that	1
has	1
all	1
the	1
internal	1
advantages	1
of	1
a	1
republican,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
external	1
force	1
of	1
a	1
monarchical	1
government.	1
I	1
mean	1
a	1
CONFEDERATE	1
REPUBLIC.	1
"This	1
form	1
of	1
government	1
is	1
a	1
convention	1
by	1
which	1
several	1
smaller	1
STATES	1
agree	1
to	1
become	1
members	1
of	1
a	1
larger	1
ONE,	1
which	1
they	1
intend	1
to	1
form.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
assemblage	1
of	1
societies	1
that	1
constitute	1
a	1
new	1
one,	1
capable	1
of	1
increasing,	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
new	1
associations,	1
till	1
they	1
arrive	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
power	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
the	1
united	1
body.	1
"A	1
republic	1
of	1
this	1
kind,	1
able	1
to	1
withstand	1
an	1
external	1
force,	1
may	1
support	1
itself	1
without	1
any	1
internal	1
corruptions.	1
The	1
form	1
of	1
this	1
society	1
prevents	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
inconveniences.	1
"If	1
a	1
single	1
member	1
should	1
attempt	1
to	1
usurp	1
the	1
supreme	1
authority,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
equal	1
authority	1
and	1
credit	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
confederate	1
states.	1
Were	1
he	1
to	1
have	1
too	1
great	1
influence	1
over	1
one,	1
this	1
would	1
alarm	1
the	1
rest.	1
Were	1
he	1
to	1
subdue	1
a	1
part,	1
that	1
which	1
would	1
still	1
remain	1
free	1
might	1
oppose	1
him	1
with	1
forces	1
independent	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
usurped	1
and	1
overpower	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
settled	1
in	1
his	1
usurpation.	1
"Should	1
a	1
popular	1
insurrection	1
happen	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
confederate	1
states	1
the	1
others	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
quell	1
it.	1
Should	1
abuses	1
creep	1
into	1
one	1
part,	1
they	1
are	1
reformed	1
by	1
those	1
that	1
remain	1
sound.	1
The	1
state	1
may	1
be	1
destroyed	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
other;	1
the	1
confederacy	1
may	1
be	1
dissolved,	1
and	1
the	1
confederates	1
preserve	1
their	1
sovereignty.	1
"As	1
this	1
government	1
is	1
composed	1
of	1
small	1
republics,	1
it	1
enjoys	1
the	1
internal	1
happiness	1
of	1
each;	1
and	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
its	1
external	1
situation,	1
it	1
is	1
possessed,	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
association,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
large	1
monarchies."	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
it	1
proper	1
to	1
quote	1
at	1
length	1
these	1
interesting	1
passages,	1
because	1
they	1
contain	1
a	1
luminous	1
abridgment	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
arguments	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
must	1
effectually	1
remove	1
the	1
false	1
impressions	1
which	1
a	1
misapplication	1
of	1
other	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
was	1
calculated	1
to	1
make.	1
They	1
have,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
an	1
intimate	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
more	1
immediate	1
design	1
of	1
this	1
paper;	1
which	1
is,	1
to	1
illustrate	1
the	1
tendency	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
to	1
repress	1
domestic	1
faction	1
and	1
insurrection.	1
A	1
distinction,	1
more	1
subtle	1
than	1
accurate,	1
has	1
been	1
raised	1
between	1
a	1
CONFEDERACY	1
and	1
a	1
CONSOLIDATION	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
The	1
essential	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be,	1
the	1
restriction	1
of	1
its	1
authority	1
to	1
the	1
members	1
in	1
their	1
collective	1
capacities,	1
without	1
reaching	1
to	1
the	1
individuals	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
are	1
composed.	1
It	1
is	1
contended	1
that	1
the	1
national	1
council	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
concern	1
with	1
any	1
object	1
of	1
internal	1
administration.	1
An	1
exact	1
equality	1
of	1
suffrage	1
between	1
the	1
members	1
has	1
also	1
been	1
insisted	1
upon	1
as	1
a	1
leading	1
feature	1
of	1
a	1
confederate	1
government.	1
These	1
positions	1
are,	1
in	1
the	1
main,	1
arbitrary;	1
they	1
are	1
supported	1
neither	1
by	1
principle	1
nor	1
precedent.	1
It	1
has	1
indeed	1
happened,	1
that	1
governments	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
have	1
generally	1
operated	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
which	1
the	1
distinction	1
taken	1
notice	1
of,	1
supposes	1
to	1
be	1
inherent	1
in	1
their	1
nature;	1
but	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
extensive	1
exceptions	1
to	1
the	1
practice,	1
which	1
serve	1
to	1
prove,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
example	1
will	1
go,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
absolute	1
rule	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
And	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
clearly	1
shown	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
investigation	1
that	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
principle	1
contended	1
for	1
has	1
prevailed,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
incurable	1
disorder	1
and	1
imbecility	1
in	1
the	1
government.	1
The	1
definition	1
of	1
a	1
CONFEDERATE	1
REPUBLIC	1
seems	1
simply	1
to	1
be	1
"an	1
assemblage	1
of	1
societies,"	1
or	1
an	1
association	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
more	1
states	1
into	1
one	1
state.	1
The	1
extent,	1
modifications,	1
and	1
objects	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
authority	1
are	1
mere	1
matters	1
of	1
discretion.	1
So	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
separate	1
organization	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
be	1
not	1
abolished;	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
exists,	1
by	1
a	1
constitutional	1
necessity,	1
for	1
local	1
purposes;	1
though	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
perfect	1
subordination	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
union,	1
it	1
would	1
still	1
be,	1
in	1
fact	1
and	1
in	1
theory,	1
an	1
association	1
of	1
states,	1
or	1
a	1
confederacy.	1
The	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
implying	1
an	1
abolition	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
makes	1
them	1
constituent	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
sovereignty,	1
by	1
allowing	1
them	1
a	1
direct	1
representation	1
in	1
the	1
Senate,	1
and	1
leaves	1
in	1
their	1
possession	1
certain	1
exclusive	1
and	1
very	1
important	1
portions	1
of	1
sovereign	1
power.	1
This	1
fully	1
corresponds,	1
in	1
every	1
rational	1
import	1
of	1
the	1
terms,	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
federal	1
government.	1
In	1
the	1
Lycian	1
confederacy,	1
which	1
consisted	1
of	1
twenty-three	1
CITIES	1
or	1
republics,	1
the	1
largest	1
were	1
entitled	1
to	1
THREE	1
votes	1
in	1
the	1
COMMON	1
COUNCIL,	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
class	1
to	1
TWO,	1
and	1
the	1
smallest	1
to	1
ONE.	1
The	1
COMMON	1
COUNCIL	1
had	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
judges	1
and	1
magistrates	1
of	1
the	1
respective	1
CITIES.	1
This	1
was	1
certainly	1
the	1
most,	1
delicate	1
species	1
of	1
interference	1
in	1
their	1
internal	1
administration;	1
for	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
seems	1
exclusively	1
appropriated	1
to	1
the	1
local	1
jurisdictions,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
officers.	1
Yet	1
Montesquieu,	1
speaking	1
of	1
this	1
association,	1
says:	1
"Were	1
I	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
model	1
of	1
an	1
excellent	1
Confederate	1
Republic,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
that	1
of	1
Lycia."	1
Thus	1
we	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
distinctions	1
insisted	1
upon	1
were	1
not	1
within	1
the	1
contemplation	1
of	1
this	1
enlightened	1
civilian;	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
conclude,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
novel	1
refinements	1
of	1
an	1
erroneous	1
theory.	1

To	1

People	1
of	1

State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
AMONG	1
the	1
numerous	1
advantages	1
promised	1
by	1
a	1
wellconstructed	1
Union,	1
none	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
accurately	1
developed	1
than	1
its	1
tendency	1
to	1
break	1
and	1
control	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
faction.	1
The	1
friend	1
of	1
popular	1
governments	1
never	1
finds	1
himself	1
so	1
much	1
alarmed	1
for	1
their	1
character	1
and	1
fate,	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
contemplates	1
their	1
propensity	1
to	1
this	1
dangerous	1
vice.	1
He	1
will	1
not	1
fail,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
set	1
a	1
due	1
value	1
on	1
any	1
plan	1
which,	1
without	1
violating	1
the	1
principles	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
attached,	1
provides	1
a	1
proper	1
cure	1
for	1
it.	1
The	1
instability,	1
injustice,	1
and	1
confusion	1
introduced	1
into	1
the	1
public	1
councils,	1
have,	1
in	1
truth,	1
been	1
the	1
mortal	1
diseases	1
under	1
which	1
popular	1
governments	1
have	1
everywhere	1
perished;	1
as	1
they	1
continue	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
favorite	1
and	1
fruitful	1
topics	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
adversaries	1
to	1
liberty	1
derive	1
their	1
most	1
specious	1
declamations.	1
The	1
valuable	1
improvements	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
American	1
constitutions	1
on	1
the	1
popular	1
models,	1
both	1
ancient	1
and	1
modern,	1
cannot	1
certainly	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
admired;	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
unwarrantable	1
partiality,	1
to	1
contend	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
as	1
effectually	1
obviated	1
the	1
danger	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
as	1
was	1
wished	1
and	1
expected.	1
Complaints	1
are	1
everywhere	1
heard	1
from	1
our	1
most	1
considerate	1
and	1
virtuous	1
citizens,	1
equally	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
public	1
and	1
private	1
faith,	1
and	1
of	1
public	1
and	1
personal	1
liberty,	1
that	1
our	1
governments	1
are	1
too	1
unstable,	1
that	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
is	1
disregarded	1
in	1
the	1
conflicts	1
of	1
rival	1
parties,	1
and	1
that	1
measures	1
are	1
too	1
often	1
decided,	1
not	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
justice	1
and	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
minor	1
party,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
superior	1
force	1
of	1
an	1
interested	1
and	1
overbearing	1
majority.	1
However	1
anxiously	1
we	1
may	1
wish	1
that	1
these	1
complaints	1
had	1
no	1
foundation,	1
the	1
evidence,	1
of	1
known	1
facts	1
will	1
not	1
permit	1
us	1
to	1
deny	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
true.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
found,	1
indeed,	1
on	1
a	1
candid	1
review	1
of	1
our	1
situation,	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
distresses	1
under	1
which	1
we	1
labor	1
have	1
been	1
erroneously	1
charged	1
on	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
our	1
governments;	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
that	1
other	1
causes	1
will	1
not	1
alone	1
account	1
for	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
heaviest	1
misfortunes;	1
and,	1
particularly,	1
for	1
that	1
prevailing	1
and	1
increasing	1
distrust	1
of	1
public	1
engagements,	1
and	1
alarm	1
for	1
private	1
rights,	1
which	1
are	1
echoed	1
from	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
continent	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
These	1
must	1
be	1
chiefly,	1
if	1
not	1
wholly,	1
effects	1
of	1
the	1
unsteadiness	1
and	1
injustice	1
with	1
which	1
a	1
factious	1
spirit	1
has	1
tainted	1
our	1
public	1
administrations.	1
By	1
a	1
faction,	1
I	1
understand	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
citizens,	1
whether	1
amounting	1
to	1
a	1
majority	1
or	1
a	1
minority	1
of	1
the	1
whole,	1
who	1
are	1
united	1
and	1
actuated	1
by	1
some	1
common	1
impulse	1
of	1
passion,	1
or	1
of	1
interest,	1
adversed	1
to	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
other	1
citizens,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
permanent	1
and	1
aggregate	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
There	1
are	1
two	1
methods	1
of	1
curing	1
the	1
mischiefs	1
of	1
faction:	1
the	1
one,	1
by	1
removing	1
its	1
causes;	1
the	1
other,	1
by	1
controlling	1
its	1
effects.	1
There	1
are	1
again	1
two	1
methods	1
of	1
removing	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
faction:	1
the	1
one,	1
by	1
destroying	1
the	1
liberty	1
which	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
its	1
existence;	1
the	1
other,	1
by	1
giving	1
to	1
every	1
citizen	1
the	1
same	1
opinions,	1
the	1
same	1
passions,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
interests.	1
It	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
more	1
truly	1
said	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
remedy,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
disease.	1
Liberty	1
is	1
to	1
faction	1
what	1
air	1
is	1
to	1
fire,	1
an	1
aliment	1
without	1
which	1
it	1
instantly	1
expires.	1
But	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
less	1
folly	1
to	1
abolish	1
liberty,	1
which	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
political	1
life,	1
because	1
it	1
nourishes	1
faction,	1
than	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
wish	1
the	1
annihilation	1
of	1
air,	1
which	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
animal	1
life,	1
because	1
it	1
imparts	1
to	1
fire	1
its	1
destructive	1
agency.	1
The	1
second	1
expedient	1
is	1
as	1
impracticable	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
would	1
be	1
unwise.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
man	1
continues	1
fallible,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
exercise	1
it,	1
different	1
opinions	1
will	1
be	1
formed.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
connection	1
subsists	1
between	1
his	1
reason	1
and	1
his	1
self-love,	1
his	1
opinions	1
and	1
his	1
passions	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
reciprocal	1
influence	1
on	1
each	1
other;	1
and	1
the	1
former	1
will	1
be	1
objects	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
latter	1
will	1
attach	1
themselves.	1
The	1
diversity	1
in	1
the	1
faculties	1
of	1
men,	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
property	1
originate,	1
is	1
not	1
less	1
an	1
insuperable	1
obstacle	1
to	1
a	1
uniformity	1
of	1
interests.	1
The	1
protection	1
of	1
these	1
faculties	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
object	1
of	1
government.	1
From	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
different	1
and	1
unequal	1
faculties	1
of	1
acquiring	1
property,	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
different	1
degrees	1
and	1
kinds	1
of	1
property	1
immediately	1
results;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
these	1
on	1
the	1
sentiments	1
and	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
respective	1
proprietors,	1
ensues	1
a	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
into	1
different	1
interests	1
and	1
parties.	1
The	1
latent	1
causes	1
of	1
faction	1
are	1
thus	1
sown	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
man;	1
and	1
we	1
see	1
them	1
everywhere	1
brought	1
into	1
different	1
degrees	1
of	1
activity,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
different	1
circumstances	1
of	1
civil	1
society.	1
A	1
zeal	1
for	1
different	1
opinions	1
concerning	1
religion,	1
concerning	1
government,	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
points,	1
as	1
well	1
of	1
speculation	1
as	1
of	1
practice;	1
an	1
attachment	1
to	1
different	1
leaders	1
ambitiously	1
contending	1
for	1
pre-eminence	1
and	1
power;	1
or	1
to	1
persons	1
of	1
other	1
descriptions	1
whose	1
fortunes	1
have	1
been	1
interesting	1
to	1
the	1
human	1
passions,	1
have,	1
in	1
turn,	1
divided	1
mankind	1
into	1
parties,	1
inflamed	1
them	1
with	1
mutual	1
animosity,	1
and	1
rendered	1
them	1
much	1
more	1
disposed	1
to	1
vex	1
and	1
oppress	1
each	1
other	1
than	1
to	1
co-operate	1
for	1
their	1
common	1
good.	1
So	1
strong	1
is	1
this	1
propensity	1
of	1
mankind	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
mutual	1
animosities,	1
that	1
where	1
no	1
substantial	1
occasion	1
presents	1
itself,	1
the	1
most	1
frivolous	1
and	1
fanciful	1
distinctions	1
have	1
been	1
sufficient	1
to	1
kindle	1
their	1
unfriendly	1
passions	1
and	1
excite	1
their	1
most	1
violent	1
conflicts.	1
But	1
the	1
most	1
common	1
and	1
durable	1
source	1
of	1
factions	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
various	1
and	1
unequal	1
distribution	1
of	1
property.	1
Those	1
who	1
hold	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
without	1
property	1
have	1
ever	1
formed	1
distinct	1
interests	1
in	1
society.	1
Those	1
who	1
are	1
creditors,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
debtors,	1
fall	1
under	1
a	1
like	1
discrimination.	1
A	1
landed	1
interest,	1
a	1
manufacturing	1
interest,	1
a	1
mercantile	1
interest,	1
a	1
moneyed	1
interest,	1
with	1
many	1
lesser	1
interests,	1
grow	1
up	1
of	1
necessity	1
in	1
civilized	1
nations,	1
and	1
divide	1
them	1
into	1
different	1
classes,	1
actuated	1
by	1
different	1
sentiments	1
and	1
views.	1
The	1
regulation	1
of	1
these	1
various	1
and	1
interfering	1
interests	1
forms	1
the	1
principal	1
task	1
of	1
modern	1
legislation,	1
and	1
involves	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
party	1
and	1
faction	1
in	1
the	1
necessary	1
and	1
ordinary	1
operations	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
No	1
man	1
is	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
judge	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
cause,	1
because	1
his	1
interest	1
would	1
certainly	1
bias	1
his	1
judgment,	1
and,	1
not	1
improbably,	1
corrupt	1
his	1
integrity.	1
With	1
equal,	1
nay	1
with	1
greater	1
reason,	1
a	1
body	1
of	1
men	1
are	1
unfit	1
to	1
be	1
both	1
judges	1
and	1
parties	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time;	1
yet	1
what	1
are	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
acts	1
of	1
legislation,	1
but	1
so	1
many	1
judicial	1
determinations,	1
not	1
indeed	1
concerning	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
single	1
persons,	1
but	1
concerning	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
large	1
bodies	1
of	1
citizens?	1
And	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
different	1
classes	1
of	1
legislators	1
but	1
advocates	1
and	1
parties	1
to	1
the	1
causes	1
which	1
they	1
determine?	1
Is	1
a	1
law	1
proposed	1
concerning	1
private	1
debts?	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
creditors	1
are	1
parties	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
debtors	1
on	1
the	1
other.	1
Justice	1
ought	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
balance	1
between	1
them.	1
Yet	1
the	1
parties	1
are,	1
and	1
must	1
be,	1
themselves	1
the	1
judges;	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
numerous	1
party,	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
faction	1
must	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
prevail.	1
Shall	1
domestic	1
manufactures	1
be	1
encouraged,	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
degree,	1
by	1
restrictions	1
on	1
foreign	1
manufactures?	1
are	1
questions	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
differently	1
decided	1
by	1
the	1
landed	1
and	1
the	1
manufacturing	1
classes,	1
and	1
probably	1
by	1
neither	1
with	1
a	1
sole	1
regard	1
to	1
justice	1
and	1
the	1
public	1
good.	1
The	1
apportionment	1
of	1
taxes	1
on	1
the	1
various	1
descriptions	1
of	1
property	1
is	1
an	1
act	1
which	1
seems	1
to	1
require	1
the	1
most	1
exact	1
impartiality;	1
yet	1
there	1
is,	1
perhaps,	1
no	1
legislative	1
act	1
in	1
which	1
greater	1
opportunity	1
and	1
temptation	1
are	1
given	1
to	1
a	1
predominant	1
party	1
to	1
trample	1
on	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
justice.	1
Every	1
shilling	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
overburden	1
the	1
inferior	1
number,	1
is	1
a	1
shilling	1
saved	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
pockets.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
enlightened	1
statesmen	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
adjust	1
these	1
clashing	1
interests,	1
and	1
render	1
them	1
all	1
subservient	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
good.	1
Enlightened	1
statesmen	1
will	1
not	1
always	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
helm.	1
Nor,	1
in	1
many	1
cases,	1
can	1
such	1
an	1
adjustment	1
be	1
made	1
at	1
all	1
without	1
taking	1
into	1
view	1
indirect	1
and	1
remote	1
considerations,	1
which	1
will	1
rarely	1
prevail	1
over	1
the	1
immediate	1
interest	1
which	1
one	1
party	1
may	1
find	1
in	1
disregarding	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
another	1
or	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
the	1
whole.	1
The	1
inference	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
brought	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
CAUSES	1
of	1
faction	1
cannot	1
be	1
removed,	1
and	1
that	1
relief	1
is	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
sought	1
in	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
controlling	1
its	1
EFFECTS.	1
If	1
a	1
faction	1
consists	1
of	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
majority,	1
relief	1
is	1
supplied	1
by	1
the	1
republican	1
principle,	1
which	1
enables	1
the	1
majority	1
to	1
defeat	1
its	1
sinister	1
views	1
by	1
regular	1
vote.	1
It	1
may	1
clog	1
the	1
administration,	1
it	1
may	1
convulse	1
the	1
society;	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
execute	1
and	1
mask	1
its	1
violence	1
under	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
When	1
a	1
majority	1
is	1
included	1
in	1
a	1
faction,	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
popular	1
government,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
enables	1
it	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
its	1
ruling	1
passion	1
or	1
interest	1
both	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
and	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
other	1
citizens.	1
To	1
secure	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
and	1
private	1
rights	1
against	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
faction,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
popular	1
government,	1
is	1
then	1
the	1
great	1
object	1
to	1
which	1
our	1
inquiries	1
are	1
directed.	1
Let	1
me	1
add	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
desideratum	1
by	1
which	1
this	1
form	1
of	1
government	1
can	1
be	1
rescued	1
from	1
the	1
opprobrium	1
under	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
so	1
long	1
labored,	1
and	1
be	1
recommended	1
to	1
the	1
esteem	1
and	1
adoption	1
of	1
mankind.	1
By	1
what	1
means	1
is	1
this	1
object	1
attainable?	1
Evidently	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
two	1
only.	1
Either	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
passion	1
or	1
interest	1
in	1
a	1
majority	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
must	1
be	1
prevented,	1
or	1
the	1
majority,	1
having	1
such	1
coexistent	1
passion	1
or	1
interest,	1
must	1
be	1
rendered,	1
by	1
their	1
number	1
and	1
local	1
situation,	1
unable	1
to	1
concert	1
and	1
carry	1
into	1
effect	1
schemes	1
of	1
oppression.	1
If	1
the	1
impulse	1
and	1
the	1
opportunity	1
be	1
suffered	1
to	1
coincide,	1
we	1
well	1
know	1
that	1
neither	1
moral	1
nor	1
religious	1
motives	1
can	1
be	1
relied	1
on	1
as	1
an	1
adequate	1
control.	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
such	1
on	1
the	1
injustice	1
and	1
violence	1
of	1
individuals,	1
and	1
lose	1
their	1
efficacy	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
combined	1
together,	1
that	1
is,	1
in	1
proportion	1
as	1
their	1
efficacy	1
becomes	1
needful.	1
From	1
this	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
concluded	1
that	1
a	1
pure	1
democracy,	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
mean	1
a	1
society	1
consisting	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
citizens,	1
who	1
assemble	1
and	1
administer	1
the	1
government	1
in	1
person,	1
can	1
admit	1
of	1
no	1
cure	1
for	1
the	1
mischiefs	1
of	1
faction.	1
A	1
common	1
passion	1
or	1
interest	1
will,	1
in	1
almost	1
every	1
case,	1
be	1
felt	1
by	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
whole;	1
a	1
communication	1
and	1
concert	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
government	1
itself;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
inducements	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
weaker	1
party	1
or	1
an	1
obnoxious	1
individual.	1
Hence	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
such	1
democracies	1
have	1
ever	1
been	1
spectacles	1
of	1
turbulence	1
and	1
contention;	1
have	1
ever	1
been	1
found	1
incompatible	1
with	1
personal	1
security	1
or	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
property;	1
and	1
have	1
in	1
general	1
been	1
as	1
short	1
in	1
their	1
lives	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
violent	1
in	1
their	1
deaths.	1
Theoretic	1
politicians,	1
who	1
have	1
patronized	1
this	1
species	1
of	1
government,	1
have	1
erroneously	1
supposed	1
that	1
by	1
reducing	1
mankind	1
to	1
a	1
perfect	1
equality	1
in	1
their	1
political	1
rights,	1
they	1
would,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
be	1
perfectly	1
equalized	1
and	1
assimilated	1
in	1
their	1
possessions,	1
their	1
opinions,	1
and	1
their	1
passions.	1
A	1
republic,	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
mean	1
a	1
government	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
scheme	1
of	1
representation	1
takes	1
place,	1
opens	1
a	1
different	1
prospect,	1
and	1
promises	1
the	1
cure	1
for	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
seeking.	1
Let	1
us	1
examine	1
the	1
points	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
varies	1
from	1
pure	1
democracy,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
comprehend	1
both	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
cure	1
and	1
the	1
efficacy	1
which	1
it	1
must	1
derive	1
from	1
the	1
Union.	1
The	1
two	1
great	1
points	1
of	1
difference	1
between	1
a	1
democracy	1
and	1
a	1
republic	1
are:	1
first,	1
the	1
delegation	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
in	1
the	1
latter,	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
citizens	1
elected	1
by	1
the	1
rest;	1
secondly,	1
the	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
citizens,	1
and	1
greater	1
sphere	1
of	1
country,	1
over	1
which	1
the	1
latter	1
may	1
be	1
extended.	1
The	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
difference	1
is,	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
to	1
refine	1
and	1
enlarge	1
the	1
public	1
views,	1
by	1
passing	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
a	1
chosen	1
body	1
of	1
citizens,	1
whose	1
wisdom	1
may	1
best	1
discern	1
the	1
true	1
interest	1
of	1
their	1
country,	1
and	1
whose	1
patriotism	1
and	1
love	1
of	1
justice	1
will	1
be	1
least	1
likely	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
it	1
to	1
temporary	1
or	1
partial	1
considerations.	1
Under	1
such	1
a	1
regulation,	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
happen	1
that	1
the	1
public	1
voice,	1
pronounced	1
by	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
consonant	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
than	1
if	1
pronounced	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
themselves,	1
convened	1
for	1
the	1
purpose.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
the	1
effect	1
may	1
be	1
inverted.	1
Men	1
of	1
factious	1
tempers,	1
of	1
local	1
prejudices,	1
or	1
of	1
sinister	1
designs,	1
may,	1
by	1
intrigue,	1
by	1
corruption,	1
or	1
by	1
other	1
means,	1
first	1
obtain	1
the	1
suffrages,	1
and	1
then	1
betray	1
the	1
interests,	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
The	1
question	1
resulting	1
is,	1
whether	1
small	1
or	1
extensive	1
republics	1
are	1
more	1
favorable	1
to	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
proper	1
guardians	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
weal;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
clearly	1
decided	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
by	1
two	1
obvious	1
considerations:	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
remarked	1
that,	1
however	1
small	1
the	1
republic	1
may	1
be,	1
the	1
representatives	1
must	1
be	1
raised	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
number,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
the	1
cabals	1
of	1
a	1
few;	1
and	1
that,	1
however	1
large	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
limited	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
number,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
the	1
confusion	1
of	1
a	1
multitude.	1
Hence,	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
representatives	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
cases	1
not	1
being	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
constituents,	1
and	1
being	1
proportionally	1
greater	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
republic,	1
it	1
follows	1
that,	1
if	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
fit	1
characters	1
be	1
not	1
less	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
republic,	1
the	1
former	1
will	1
present	1
a	1
greater	1
option,	1
and	1
consequently	1
a	1
greater	1
probability	1
of	1
a	1
fit	1
choice.	1
In	1
the	1
next	1
place,	1
as	1
each	1
representative	1
will	1
be	1
chosen	1
by	1
a	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
citizens	1
in	1
the	1
large	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
republic,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
difficult	1
for	1
unworthy	1
candidates	1
to	1
practice	1
with	1
success	1
the	1
vicious	1
arts	1
by	1
which	1
elections	1
are	1
too	1
often	1
carried;	1
and	1
the	1
suffrages	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
being	1
more	1
free,	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
centre	1
in	1
men	1
who	1
possess	1
the	1
most	1
attractive	1
merit	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
diffusive	1
and	1
established	1
characters.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
confessed	1
that	1
in	1
this,	1
as	1
in	1
most	1
other	1
cases,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
mean,	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
of	1
which	1
inconveniences	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
to	1
lie.	1
By	1
enlarging	1
too	1
much	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
electors,	1
you	1
render	1
the	1
representatives	1
too	1
little	1
acquainted	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
local	1
circumstances	1
and	1
lesser	1
interests;	1
as	1
by	1
reducing	1
it	1
too	1
much,	1
you	1
render	1
him	1
unduly	1
attached	1
to	1
these,	1
and	1
too	1
little	1
fit	1
to	1
comprehend	1
and	1
pursue	1
great	1
and	1
national	1
objects.	1
The	1
federal	1
Constitution	1
forms	1
a	1
happy	1
combination	1
in	1
this	1
respect;	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
aggregate	1
interests	1
being	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
national,	1
the	1
local	1
and	1
particular	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures.	1
The	1
other	1
point	1
of	1
difference	1
is,	1
the	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
citizens	1
and	1
extent	1
of	1
territory	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
brought	1
within	1
the	1
compass	1
of	1
republican	1
than	1
of	1
democratic	1
government;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
circumstance	1
principally	1
which	1
renders	1
factious	1
combinations	1
less	1
to	1
be	1
dreaded	1
in	1
the	1
former	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
smaller	1
the	1
society,	1
the	1
fewer	1
probably	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
distinct	1
parties	1
and	1
interests	1
composing	1
it;	1
the	1
fewer	1
the	1
distinct	1
parties	1
and	1
interests,	1
the	1
more	1
frequently	1
will	1
a	1
majority	1
be	1
found	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
party;	1
and	1
the	1
smaller	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
individuals	1
composing	1
a	1
majority,	1
and	1
the	1
smaller	1
the	1
compass	1
within	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
placed,	1
the	1
more	1
easily	1
will	1
they	1
concert	1
and	1
execute	1
their	1
plans	1
of	1
oppression.	1
Extend	1
the	1
sphere,	1
and	1
you	1
take	1
in	1
a	1
greater	1
variety	1
of	1
parties	1
and	1
interests;	1
you	1
make	1
it	1
less	1
probable	1
that	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
common	1
motive	1
to	1
invade	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
other	1
citizens;	1
or	1
if	1
such	1
a	1
common	1
motive	1
exists,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
difficult	1
for	1
all	1
who	1
feel	1
it	1
to	1
discover	1
their	1
own	1
strength,	1
and	1
to	1
act	1
in	1
unison	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
Besides	1
other	1
impediments,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
remarked	1
that,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
consciousness	1
of	1
unjust	1
or	1
dishonorable	1
purposes,	1
communication	1
is	1
always	1
checked	1
by	1
distrust	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
whose	1
concurrence	1
is	1
necessary.	1
Hence,	1
it	1
clearly	1
appears,	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
advantage	1
which	1
a	1
republic	1
has	1
over	1
a	1
democracy,	1
in	1
controlling	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
faction,	1
is	1
enjoyed	1
by	1
a	1
large	1
over	1
a	1
small	1
republic,--is	1
enjoyed	1
by	1
the	1
Union	1
over	1
the	1
States	1
composing	1
it.	1
Does	1
the	1
advantage	1
consist	1
in	1
the	1
substitution	1
of	1
representatives	1
whose	1
enlightened	1
views	1
and	1
virtuous	1
sentiments	1
render	1
them	1
superior	1
to	1
local	1
prejudices	1
and	1
schemes	1
of	1
injustice?	1
It	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
denied	1
that	1
the	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
possess	1
these	1
requisite	1
endowments.	1
Does	1
it	1
consist	1
in	1
the	1
greater	1
security	1
afforded	1
by	1
a	1
greater	1
variety	1
of	1
parties,	1
against	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
party	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
outnumber	1
and	1
oppress	1
the	1
rest?	1
In	1
an	1
equal	1
degree	1
does	1
the	1
increased	1
variety	1
of	1
parties	1
comprised	1
within	1
the	1
Union,	1
increase	1
this	1
security.	1
Does	1
it,	1
in	1
fine,	1
consist	1
in	1
the	1
greater	1
obstacles	1
opposed	1
to	1
the	1
concert	1
and	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
the	1
secret	1
wishes	1
of	1
an	1
unjust	1
and	1
interested	1
majority?	1
Here,	1
again,	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
gives	1
it	1
the	1
most	1
palpable	1
advantage.	1
The	1
influence	1
of	1
factious	1
leaders	1
may	1
kindle	1
a	1
flame	1
within	1
their	1
particular	1
States,	1
but	1
will	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
spread	1
a	1
general	1
conflagration	1
through	1
the	1
other	1
States.	1
A	1
religious	1
sect	1
may	1
degenerate	1
into	1
a	1
political	1
faction	1
in	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy;	1
but	1
the	1
variety	1
of	1
sects	1
dispersed	1
over	1
the	1
entire	1
face	1
of	1
it	1
must	1
secure	1
the	1
national	1
councils	1
against	1
any	1
danger	1
from	1
that	1
source.	1
A	1
rage	1
for	1
paper	1
money,	1
for	1
an	1
abolition	1
of	1
debts,	1
for	1
an	1
equal	1
division	1
of	1
property,	1
or	1
for	1
any	1
other	1
improper	1
or	1
wicked	1
project,	1
will	1
be	1
less	1
apt	1
to	1
pervade	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
than	1
a	1
particular	1
member	1
of	1
it;	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
proportion	1
as	1
such	1
a	1
malady	1
is	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
taint	1
a	1
particular	1
county	1
or	1
district,	1
than	1
an	1
entire	1
State.	1
In	1
the	1
extent	1
and	1
proper	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
therefore,	1
we	1
behold	1
a	1
republican	1
remedy	1
for	1
the	1
diseases	1
most	1
incident	1
to	1
republican	1
government.	1
And	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
pleasure	1
and	1
pride	1
we	1
feel	1
in	1
being	1
republicans,	1
ought	1
to	1

zeal	1
in	1

THE	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
in	1
a	1
commercial	1
light,	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
points	1
about	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
least	1
room	1
to	1
entertain	1
a	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion,	1
and	1
which	1
has,	1
in	1
fact,	1
commanded	1
the	1
most	1
general	1
assent	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
any	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
the	1
subject.	1
This	1
applies	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
our	1
intercourse	1
with	1
foreign	1
countries	1
as	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
There	1
are	1
appearances	1
to	1
authorize	1
a	1
supposition	1
that	1
the	1
adventurous	1
spirit,	1
which	1
distinguishes	1
the	1
commercial	1
character	1
of	1
America,	1
has	1
already	1
excited	1
uneasy	1
sensations	1
in	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
maritime	1
powers	1
of	1
Europe.	1
They	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
apprehensive	1
of	1
our	1
too	1
great	1
interference	1
in	1
that	1
carrying	1
trade,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
their	1
navigation	1
and	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
their	1
naval	1
strength.	1
Those	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
colonies	1
in	1
America	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
what	1
this	1
country	1
is	1
capable	1
of	1
becoming,	1
with	1
painful	1
solicitude.	1
They	1
foresee	1
the	1
dangers	1
that	1
may	1
threaten	1
their	1
American	1
dominions	1
from	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
of	1
States,	1
which	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
dispositions,	1
and	1
would	1
possess	1
all	1
the	1
means,	1
requisite	1
to	1
the	1
creation	1
of	1
a	1
powerful	1
marine.	1
Impressions	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
will	1
naturally	1
indicate	1
the	1
policy	1
of	1
fostering	1
divisions	1
among	1
us,	1
and	1
of	1
depriving	1
us,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible,	1
of	1
an	1
ACTIVE	1
COMMERCE	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
bottoms.	1
This	1
would	1
answer	1
the	1
threefold	1
purpose	1
of	1
preventing	1
our	1
interference	1
in	1
their	1
navigation,	1
of	1
monopolizing	1
the	1
profits	1
of	1
our	1
trade,	1
and	1
of	1
clipping	1
the	1
wings	1
by	1
which	1
we	1
might	1
soar	1
to	1
a	1
dangerous	1
greatness.	1
Did	1
not	1
prudence	1
forbid	1
the	1
detail,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
trace,	1
by	1
facts,	1
the	1
workings	1
of	1
this	1
policy	1
to	1
the	1
cabinets	1
of	1
ministers.	1
If	1
we	1
continue	1
united,	1
we	1
may	1
counteract	1
a	1
policy	1
so	1
unfriendly	1
to	1
our	1
prosperity	1
in	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
ways.	1
By	1
prohibitory	1
regulations,	1
extending,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
throughout	1
the	1
States,	1
we	1
may	1
oblige	1
foreign	1
countries	1
to	1
bid	1
against	1
each	1
other,	1
for	1
the	1
privileges	1
of	1
our	1
markets.	1
This	1
assertion	1
will	1
not	1
appear	1
chimerical	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
appreciate	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
markets	1
of	1
three	1
millions	1
of	1
people--increasing	1
in	1
rapid	1
progression,	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
exclusively	1
addicted	1
to	1
agriculture,	1
and	1
likely	1
from	1
local	1
circumstances	1
to	1
remain	1
so--to	1
any	1
manufacturing	1
nation;	1
and	1
the	1
immense	1
difference	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
trade	1
and	1
navigation	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
nation,	1
between	1
a	1
direct	1
communication	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
ships,	1
and	1
an	1
indirect	1
conveyance	1
of	1
its	1
products	1
and	1
returns,	1
to	1
and	1
from	1
America,	1
in	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
another	1
country.	1
Suppose,	1
for	1
instance,	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
government	1
in	1
America,	1
capable	1
of	1
excluding	1
Great	1
Britain	1
(with	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
at	1
present	1
no	1
treaty	1
of	1
commerce)	1
from	1
all	1
our	1
ports;	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
probable	1
operation	1
of	1
this	1
step	1
upon	1
her	1
politics?	1
Would	1
it	1
not	1
enable	1
us	1
to	1
negotiate,	1
with	1
the	1
fairest	1
prospect	1
of	1
success,	1
for	1
commercial	1
privileges	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
valuable	1
and	1
extensive	1
kind,	1
in	1
the	1
dominions	1
of	1
that	1
kingdom?	1
When	1
these	1
questions	1
have	1
been	1
asked,	1
upon	1
other	1
occasions,	1
they	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
plausible,	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
solid	1
or	1
satisfactory	1
answer.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
that	1
prohibitions	1
on	1
our	1
part	1
would	1
produce	1
no	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
system	1
of	1
Britain,	1
because	1
she	1
could	1
prosecute	1
her	1
trade	1
with	1
us	1
through	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
the	1
Dutch,	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
her	1
immediate	1
customers	1
and	1
paymasters	1
for	1
those	1
articles	1
which	1
were	1
wanted	1
for	1
the	1
supply	1
of	1
our	1
markets.	1
But	1
would	1
not	1
her	1
navigation	1
be	1
materially	1
injured	1
by	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
important	1
advantage	1
of	1
being	1
her	1
own	1
carrier	1
in	1
that	1
trade?	1
Would	1
not	1
the	1
principal	1
part	1
of	1
its	1
profits	1
be	1
intercepted	1
by	1
the	1
Dutch,	1
as	1
a	1
compensation	1
for	1
their	1
agency	1
and	1
risk?	1
Would	1
not	1
the	1
mere	1
circumstance	1
of	1
freight	1
occasion	1
a	1
considerable	1
deduction?	1
Would	1
not	1
so	1
circuitous	1
an	1
intercourse	1
facilitate	1
the	1
competitions	1
of	1
other	1
nations,	1
by	1
enhancing	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
British	1
commodities	1
in	1
our	1
markets,	1
and	1
by	1
transferring	1
to	1
other	1
hands	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
this	1
interesting	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
commerce?	1
A	1
mature	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
objects	1
suggested	1
by	1
these	1
questions	1
will	1
justify	1
a	1
belief	1
that	1
the	1
real	1
disadvantages	1
to	1
Britain	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
things,	1
conspiring	1
with	1
the	1
pre-possessions	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
American	1
trade,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
importunities	1
of	1
the	1
West	1
India	1
islands,	1
would	1
produce	1
a	1
relaxation	1
in	1
her	1
present	1
system,	1
and	1
would	1
let	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
privileges	1
in	1
the	1
markets	1
of	1
those	1
islands	1
elsewhere,	1
from	1
which	1
our	1
trade	1
would	1
derive	1
the	1
most	1
substantial	1
benefits.	1
Such	1
a	1
point	1
gained	1
from	1
the	1
British	1
government,	1
and	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
expected	1
without	1
an	1
equivalent	1
in	1
exemptions	1
and	1
immunities	1
in	1
our	1
markets,	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
correspondent	1
effect	1
on	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
other	1
nations,	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
inclined	1
to	1
see	1
themselves	1
altogether	1
supplanted	1
in	1
our	1
trade.	1
A	1
further	1
resource	1
for	1
influencing	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
European	1
nations	1
toward	1
us,	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
would	1
arise	1
from	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
a	1
federal	1
navy.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
continuance	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
under	1
an	1
efficient	1
government	1
would	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
our	1
power,	1
at	1
a	1
period	1
not	1
very	1
distant,	1
to	1
create	1
a	1
navy	1
which,	1
if	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
vie	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
maritime	1
powers,	1
would	1
at	1
least	1
be	1
of	1
respectable	1
weight	1
if	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
scale	1
of	1
either	1
of	1
two	1
contending	1
parties.	1
This	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
peculiarly	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
operations	1
in	1
the	1
West	1
Indies.	1
A	1
few	1
ships	1
of	1
the	1
line,	1
sent	1
opportunely	1
to	1
the	1
reinforcement	1
of	1
either	1
side,	1
would	1
often	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
decide	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
a	1
campaign,	1
on	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
which	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
magnitude	1
were	1
suspended.	1
Our	1
position	1
is,	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
a	1
most	1
commanding	1
one.	1
And	1
if	1
to	1
this	1
consideration	1
we	1
add	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
usefulness	1
of	1
supplies	1
from	1
this	1
country,	1
in	1
the	1
prosecution	1
of	1
military	1
operations	1
in	1
the	1
West	1
Indies,	1
it	1
will	1
readily	1
be	1
perceived	1
that	1
a	1
situation	1
so	1
favorable	1
would	1
enable	1
us	1
to	1
bargain	1
with	1
great	1
advantage	1
for	1
commercial	1
privileges.	1
A	1
price	1
would	1
be	1
set	1
not	1
only	1
upon	1
our	1
friendship,	1
but	1
upon	1
our	1
neutrality.	1
By	1
a	1
steady	1
adherence	1
to	1
the	1
Union	1
we	1
may	1
hope,	1
erelong,	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
arbiter	1
of	1
Europe	1
in	1
America,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
incline	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
European	1
competitions	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
our	1
interest	1
may	1
dictate.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
reverse	1
of	1
this	1
eligible	1
situation,	1
we	1
shall	1
discover	1
that	1
the	1
rivalships	1
of	1
the	1
parts	1
would	1
make	1
them	1
checks	1
upon	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
would	1
frustrate	1
all	1
the	1
tempting	1
advantages	1
which	1
nature	1
has	1
kindly	1
placed	1
within	1
our	1
reach.	1
In	1
a	1
state	1
so	1
insignificant	1
our	1
commerce	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
prey	1
to	1
the	1
wanton	1
intermeddlings	1
of	1
all	1
nations	1
at	1
war	1
with	1
each	1
other;	1
who,	1
having	1
nothing	1
to	1
fear	1
from	1
us,	1
would	1
with	1
little	1
scruple	1
or	1
remorse,	1
supply	1
their	1
wants	1
by	1
depredations	1
on	1
our	1
property	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
it	1
fell	1
in	1
their	1
way.	1
The	1
rights	1
of	1
neutrality	1
will	1
only	1
be	1
respected	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
defended	1
by	1
an	1
adequate	1
power.	1
A	1
nation,	1
despicable	1
by	1
its	1
weakness,	1
forfeits	1
even	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
being	1
neutral.	1
Under	1
a	1
vigorous	1
national	1
government,	1
the	1
natural	1
strength	1
and	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
directed	1
to	1
a	1
common	1
interest,	1
would	1
baffle	1
all	1
the	1
combinations	1
of	1
European	1
jealousy	1
to	1
restrain	1
our	1
growth.	1
This	1
situation	1
would	1
even	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
motive	1
to	1
such	1
combinations,	1
by	1
inducing	1
an	1
impracticability	1
of	1
success.	1
An	1
active	1
commerce,	1
an	1
extensive	1
navigation,	1
and	1
a	1
flourishing	1
marine	1
would	1
then	1
be	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
moral	1
and	1
physical	1
necessity.	1
We	1
might	1
defy	1
the	1
little	1
arts	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
politicians	1
to	1
control	1
or	1
vary	1
the	1
irresistible	1
and	1
unchangeable	1
course	1
of	1
nature.	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
disunion,	1
these	1
combinations	1
might	1
exist	1
and	1
might	1
operate	1
with	1
success.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
maritime	1
nations,	1
availing	1
themselves	1
of	1
our	1
universal	1
impotence,	1
to	1
prescribe	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
our	1
political	1
existence;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
common	1
interest	1
in	1
being	1
our	1
carriers,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
in	1
preventing	1
our	1
becoming	1
theirs,	1
they	1
would	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
combine	1
to	1
embarrass	1
our	1
navigation	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
would	1
in	1
effect	1
destroy	1
it,	1
and	1
confine	1
us	1
to	1
a	1
PASSIVE	1
COMMERCE.	1
We	1
should	1
then	1
be	1
compelled	1
to	1
content	1
ourselves	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
price	1
of	1
our	1
commodities,	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
profits	1
of	1
our	1
trade	1
snatched	1
from	1
us	1
to	1
enrich	1
our	1
enemies	1
and	1
persecutors.	1
That	1
unequaled	1
spirit	1
of	1
enterprise,	1
which	1
signalizes	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
American	1
merchants	1
and	1
navigators,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
itself	1
an	1
inexhaustible	1
mine	1
of	1
national	1
wealth,	1
would	1
be	1
stifled	1
and	1
lost,	1
and	1
poverty	1
and	1
disgrace	1
would	1
overspread	1
a	1
country	1
which,	1
with	1
wisdom,	1
might	1
make	1
herself	1
the	1
admiration	1
and	1
envy	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
There	1
are	1
rights	1
of	1
great	1
moment	1
to	1
the	1
trade	1
of	1
America	1
which	1
are	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
Union--I	1
allude	1
to	1
the	1
fisheries,	1
to	1
the	1
navigation	1
of	1
the	1
Western	1
lakes,	1
and	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Mississippi.	1
The	1
dissolution	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy	1
would	1
give	1
room	1
for	1
delicate	1
questions	1
concerning	1
the	1
future	1
existence	1
of	1
these	1
rights;	1
which	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
more	1
powerful	1
partners	1
would	1
hardly	1
fail	1
to	1
solve	1
to	1
our	1
disadvantage.	1
The	1
disposition	1
of	1
Spain	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
Mississippi	1
needs	1
no	1
comment.	1
France	1
and	1
Britain	1
are	1
concerned	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
fisheries,	1
and	1
view	1
them	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
moment	1
to	1
their	1
navigation.	1
They,	1
of	1
course,	1
would	1
hardly	1
remain	1
long	1
indifferent	1
to	1
that	1
decided	1
mastery,	1
of	1
which	1
experience	1
has	1
shown	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
possessed	1
in	1
this	1
valuable	1
branch	1
of	1
traffic,	1
and	1
by	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
undersell	1
those	1
nations	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
markets.	1
What	1
more	1
natural	1
than	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
exclude	1
from	1
the	1
lists	1
such	1
dangerous	1
competitors?	1
This	1
branch	1
of	1
trade	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
partial	1
benefit.	1
All	1
the	1
navigating	1
States	1
may,	1
in	1
different	1
degrees,	1
advantageously	1
participate	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
under	1
circumstances	1
of	1
a	1
greater	1
extension	1
of	1
mercantile	1
capital,	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
unlikely	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
As	1
a	1
nursery	1
of	1
seamen,	1
it	1
now	1
is,	1
or	1
when	1
time	1
shall	1
have	1
more	1
nearly	1
assimilated	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
navigation	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
will	1
become,	1
a	1
universal	1
resource.	1
To	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
a	1
navy,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
indispensable.	1
To	1
this	1
great	1
national	1
object,	1
a	1
NAVY,	1
union	1
will	1
contribute	1
in	1
various	1
ways.	1
Every	1
institution	1
will	1
grow	1
and	1
flourish	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
quantity	1
and	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
concentred	1
towards	1
its	1
formation	1
and	1
support.	1
A	1
navy	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
embrace	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
all,	1
is	1
an	1
object	1
far	1
less	1
remote	1
than	1
a	1
navy	1
of	1
any	1
single	1
State	1
or	1
partial	1
confederacy,	1
which	1
would	1
only	1
embrace	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
part.	1
It	1
happens,	1
indeed,	1
that	1
different	1
portions	1
of	1
confederated	1
America	1
possess	1
each	1
some	1
peculiar	1
advantage	1
for	1
this	1
essential	1
establishment.	1
The	1
more	1
southern	1
States	1
furnish	1
in	1
greater	1
abundance	1
certain	1
kinds	1
of	1
naval	1
stores--tar,	1
pitch,	1
and	1
turpentine.	1
Their	1
wood	1
for	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
ships	1
is	1
also	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
solid	1
and	1
lasting	1
texture.	1
The	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
the	1
ships	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
navy	1
might	1
be	1
composed,	1
if	1
chiefly	1
constructed	1
of	1
Southern	1
wood,	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
signal	1
importance,	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
naval	1
strength	1
or	1
of	1
national	1
economy.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
Southern	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Middle	1
States	1
yield	1
a	1
greater	1
plenty	1
of	1
iron,	1
and	1
of	1
better	1
quality.	1
Seamen	1
must	1
chiefly	1
be	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
Northern	1
hive.	1
The	1
necessity	1
of	1
naval	1
protection	1
to	1
external	1
or	1
maritime	1
commerce	1
does	1
not	1
require	1
a	1
particular	1
elucidation,	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
conduciveness	1
of	1
that	1
species	1
of	1
commerce	1
to	1
the	1
prosperity	1
of	1
a	1
navy.	1
An	1
unrestrained	1
intercourse	1
between	1
the	1
States	1
themselves	1
will	1
advance	1
the	1
trade	1
of	1
each	1
by	1
an	1
interchange	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
productions,	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
supply	1
of	1
reciprocal	1
wants	1
at	1
home,	1
but	1
for	1
exportation	1
to	1
foreign	1
markets.	1
The	1
veins	1
of	1
commerce	1
in	1
every	1
part	1
will	1
be	1
replenished,	1
and	1
will	1
acquire	1
additional	1
motion	1
and	1
vigor	1
from	1
a	1
free	1
circulation	1
of	1
the	1
commodities	1
of	1
every	1
part.	1
Commercial	1
enterprise	1
will	1
have	1
much	1
greater	1
scope,	1
from	1
the	1
diversity	1
in	1
the	1
productions	1
of	1
different	1
States.	1
When	1
the	1
staple	1
of	1
one	1
fails	1
from	1
a	1
bad	1
harvest	1
or	1
unproductive	1
crop,	1
it	1
can	1
call	1
to	1
its	1
aid	1
the	1
staple	1
of	1
another.	1
The	1
variety,	1
not	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
value,	1
of	1
products	1
for	1
exportation	1
contributes	1
to	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
foreign	1
commerce.	1
It	1
can	1
be	1
conducted	1
upon	1
much	1
better	1
terms	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
materials	1
of	1
a	1
given	1
value	1
than	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
materials	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
value;	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
competitions	1
of	1
trade	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
fluctations	1
of	1
markets.	1
Particular	1
articles	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
great	1
demand	1
at	1
certain	1
periods,	1
and	1
unsalable	1
at	1
others;	1
but	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
articles,	1
it	1
can	1
scarcely	1
happen	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
all	1
be	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
predicament,	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
account	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
the	1
merchant	1
would	1
be	1
less	1
liable	1
to	1
any	1
considerable	1
obstruction	1
or	1
stagnation.	1
The	1
speculative	1
trader	1
will	1
at	1
once	1
perceive	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
these	1
observations,	1
and	1
will	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
the	1
aggregate	1
balance	1
of	1
the	1
commerce	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
would	1
bid	1
fair	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
more	1
favorable	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
thirteen	1
States	1
without	1
union	1
or	1
with	1
partial	1
unions.	1
It	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
replied	1
to	1
this,	1
that	1
whether	1
the	1
States	1
are	1
united	1
or	1
disunited,	1
there	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
an	1
intimate	1
intercourse	1
between	1
them	1
which	1
would	1
answer	1
the	1
same	1
ends;	1
this	1
intercourse	1
would	1
be	1
fettered,	1
interrupted,	1
and	1
narrowed	1
by	1
a	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
causes,	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
papers	1
have	1
been	1
amply	1
detailed.	1
A	1
unity	1
of	1
commercial,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
political,	1
interests,	1
can	1
only	1
result	1
from	1
a	1
unity	1
of	1
government.	1
There	1
are	1
other	1
points	1
of	1
view	1
in	1
which	1
this	1
subject	1
might	1
be	1
placed,	1
of	1
a	1
striking	1
and	1
animating	1
kind.	1
But	1
they	1
would	1
lead	1
us	1
too	1
far	1
into	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
futurity,	1
and	1
would	1
involve	1
topics	1
not	1
proper	1
for	1
a	1
newspaper	1
discussion.	1
I	1
shall	1
briefly	1
observe,	1
that	1
our	1
situation	1
invites	1
and	1
our	1
interests	1
prompt	1
us	1
to	1
aim	1
at	1
an	1
ascendant	1
in	1
the	1
system	1
of	1
American	1
affairs.	1
The	1
world	1
may	1
politically,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
geographically,	1
be	1
divided	1
into	1
four	1
parts,	1
each	1
having	1
a	1
distinct	1
set	1
of	1
interests.	1
Unhappily	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
three,	1
Europe,	1
by	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
by	1
her	1
negotiations,	1
by	1
force	1
and	1
by	1
fraud,	1
has,	1
in	1
different	1
degrees,	1
extended	1
her	1
dominion	1
over	1
them	1
all.	1
Africa,	1
Asia,	1
and	1
America,	1
have	1
successively	1
felt	1
her	1
domination.	1
The	1
superiority	1
she	1
has	1
long	1
maintained	1
has	1
tempted	1
her	1
to	1
plume	1
herself	1
as	1
the	1
Mistress	1
of	1
the	1
World,	1
and	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
mankind	1
as	1
created	1
for	1
her	1
benefit.	1
Men	1
admired	1
as	1
profound	1
philosophers	1
have,	1
in	1
direct	1
terms,	1
attributed	1
to	1
her	1
inhabitants	1
a	1
physical	1
superiority,	1
and	1
have	1
gravely	1
asserted	1
that	1
all	1
animals,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
human	1
species,	1
degenerate	1
in	1
America--that	1
even	1
dogs	1
cease	1
to	1
bark	1
after	1
having	1
breathed	1
awhile	1
in	1
our	1
atmosphere.1	1
Facts	1
have	1
too	1
long	1
supported	1
these	1
arrogant	1
pretensions	1
of	1
the	1
Europeans.	1
It	1
belongs	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
vindicate	1
the	1
honor	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race,	1
and	1
to	1
teach	1
that	1
assuming	1
brother,	1
moderation.	1
Union	1
will	1
enable	1
us	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
Disunion	1
will	1
will	1
add	1
another	1
victim	1
to	1
his	1
triumphs.	1
Let	1
Americans	1
disdain	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
European	1
greatness!	1
Let	1
the	1
thirteen	1
States,	1
bound	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
strict	1
and	1
indissoluble	1
Union,	1
concur	1
in	1
erecting	1
one	1
great	1
American	1
system,	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
all	1
transatlantic	1
force	1
or	1
influence,	1
and	1
able	1
to	1
dictate	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
old	1
and	1
the	1

THE	1
effects	1
of	1
Union	1
upon	1
the	1
commercial	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
have	1
been	1
sufficiently	1
delineated.	1
Its	1
tendency	1
to	1
promote	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
revenue	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
our	1
present	1
inquiry.	1
The	1
prosperity	1
of	1
commerce	1
is	1
now	1
perceived	1
and	1
acknowledged	1
by	1
all	1
enlightened	1
statesmen	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
useful	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
productive	1
source	1
of	1
national	1
wealth,	1
and	1
has	1
accordingly	1
become	1
a	1
primary	1
object	1
of	1
their	1
political	1
cares.	1
By	1
multiplying	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
gratification,	1
by	1
promoting	1
the	1
introduction	1
and	1
circulation	1
of	1
the	1
precious	1
metals,	1
those	1
darling	1
objects	1
of	1
human	1
avarice	1
and	1
enterprise,	1
it	1
serves	1
to	1
vivify	1
and	1
invigorate	1
the	1
channels	1
of	1
industry,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
flow	1
with	1
greater	1
activity	1
and	1
copiousness.	1
The	1
assiduous	1
merchant,	1
the	1
laborious	1
husbandman,	1
the	1
active	1
mechanic,	1
and	1
the	1
industrious	1
manufacturer,--all	1
orders	1
of	1
men,	1
look	1
forward	1
with	1
eager	1
expectation	1
and	1
growing	1
alacrity	1
to	1
this	1
pleasing	1
reward	1
of	1
their	1
toils.	1
The	1
often-agitated	1
question	1
between	1
agriculture	1
and	1
commerce	1
has,	1
from	1
indubitable	1
experience,	1
received	1
a	1
decision	1
which	1
has	1
silenced	1
the	1
rivalship	1
that	1
once	1
subsisted	1
between	1
them,	1
and	1
has	1
proved,	1
to	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
their	1
friends,	1
that	1
their	1
interests	1
are	1
intimately	1
blended	1
and	1
interwoven.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
in	1
various	1
countries	1
that,	1
in	1
proportion	1
as	1
commerce	1
has	1
flourished,	1
land	1
has	1
risen	1
in	1
value.	1
And	1
how	1
could	1
it	1
have	1
happened	1
otherwise?	1
Could	1
that	1
which	1
procures	1
a	1
freer	1
vent	1
for	1
the	1
products	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
furnishes	1
new	1
incitements	1
to	1
the	1
cultivation	1
of	1
land,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
instrument	1
in	1
increasing	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
money	1
in	1
a	1
state--could	1
that,	1
in	1
fine,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
faithful	1
handmaid	1
of	1
labor	1
and	1
industry,	1
in	1
every	1
shape,	1
fail	1
to	1
augment	1
that	1
article,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
prolific	1
parent	1
of	1
far	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
objects	1
upon	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
exerted?	1
It	1
is	1
astonishing	1
that	1
so	1
simple	1
a	1
truth	1
should	1
ever	1
have	1
had	1
an	1
adversary;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
one,	1
among	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
proofs,	1
how	1
apt	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
ill-informed	1
jealousy,	1
or	1
of	1
too	1
great	1
abstraction	1
and	1
refinement,	1
is	1
to	1
lead	1
men	1
astray	1
from	1
the	1
plainest	1
truths	1
of	1
reason	1
and	1
conviction.	1
The	1
ability	1
of	1
a	1
country	1
to	1
pay	1
taxes	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
proportioned,	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
degree,	1
to	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
money	1
in	1
circulation,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
celerity	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
circulates.	1
Commerce,	1
contributing	1
to	1
both	1
these	1
objects,	1
must	1
of	1
necessity	1
render	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
taxes	1
easier,	1
and	1
facilitate	1
the	1
requisite	1
supplies	1
to	1
the	1
treasury.	1
The	1
hereditary	1
dominions	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Germany	1
contain	1
a	1
great	1
extent	1
of	1
fertile,	1
cultivated,	1
and	1
populous	1
territory,	1
a	1
large	1
proportion	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
situated	1
in	1
mild	1
and	1
luxuriant	1
climates.	1
In	1
some	1
parts	1
of	1
this	1
territory	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
the	1
best	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
mines	1
in	1
Europe.	1
And	1
yet,	1
from	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
the	1
fostering	1
influence	1
of	1
commerce,	1
that	1
monarch	1
can	1
boast	1
but	1
slender	1
revenues.	1
He	1
has	1
several	1
times	1
been	1
compelled	1
to	1
owe	1
obligations	1
to	1
the	1
pecuniary	1
succors	1
of	1
other	1
nations	1
for	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
his	1
essential	1
interests,	1
and	1
is	1
unable,	1
upon	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
resources,	1
to	1
sustain	1
a	1
long	1
or	1
continued	1
war.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
this	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
alone	1
that	1
Union	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
to	1
conduce	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
revenue.	1
There	1
are	1
other	1
points	1
of	1
view,	1
in	1
which	1
its	1
influence	1
will	1
appear	1
more	1
immediate	1
and	1
decisive.	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
from	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
from	1
the	1
habits	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
from	1
the	1
experience	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
itself,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impracticable	1
to	1
raise	1
any	1
very	1
considerable	1
sums	1
by	1
direct	1
taxation.	1
Tax	1
laws	1
have	1
in	1
vain	1
been	1
multiplied;	1
new	1
methods	1
to	1
enforce	1
the	1
collection	1
have	1
in	1
vain	1
been	1
tried;	1
the	1
public	1
expectation	1
has	1
been	1
uniformly	1
disappointed,	1
and	1
the	1
treasuries	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
have	1
remained	1
empty.	1
The	1
popular	1
system	1
of	1
administration	1
inherent	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
popular	1
government,	1
coinciding	1
with	1
the	1
real	1
scarcity	1
of	1
money	1
incident	1
to	1
a	1
languid	1
and	1
mutilated	1
state	1
of	1
trade,	1
has	1
hitherto	1
defeated	1
every	1
experiment	1
for	1
extensive	1
collections,	1
and	1
has	1
at	1
length	1
taught	1
the	1
different	1
legislatures	1
the	1
folly	1
of	1
attempting	1
them.	1
No	1
person	1
acquainted	1
with	1
what	1
happens	1
in	1
other	1
countries	1
will	1
be	1
surprised	1
at	1
this	1
circumstance.	1
In	1
so	1
opulent	1
a	1
nation	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
Britain,	1
where	1
direct	1
taxes	1
from	1
superior	1
wealth	1
must	1
be	1
much	1
more	1
tolerable,	1
and,	1
from	1
the	1
vigor	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
much	1
more	1
practicable,	1
than	1
in	1
America,	1
far	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
revenue	1
is	1
derived	1
from	1
taxes	1
of	1
the	1
indirect	1
kind,	1
from	1
imposts,	1
and	1
from	1
excises.	1
Duties	1
on	1
imported	1
articles	1
form	1
a	1
large	1
branch	1
of	1
this	1
latter	1
description.	1
In	1
America,	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
depend	1
for	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
revenue	1
chiefly	1
on	1
such	1
duties.	1
In	1
most	1
parts	1
of	1
it,	1
excises	1
must	1
be	1
confined	1
within	1
a	1
narrow	1
compass.	1
The	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
ill	1
brook	1
the	1
inquisitive	1
and	1
peremptory	1
spirit	1
of	1
excise	1
laws.	1
The	1
pockets	1
of	1
the	1
farmers,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
will	1
reluctantly	1
yield	1
but	1
scanty	1
supplies,	1
in	1
the	1
unwelcome	1
shape	1
of	1
impositions	1
on	1
their	1
houses	1
and	1
lands;	1
and	1
personal	1
property	1
is	1
too	1
precarious	1
and	1
invisible	1
a	1
fund	1
to	1
be	1
laid	1
hold	1
of	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
way	1
than	1
by	1
the	1
inperceptible	1
agency	1
of	1
taxes	1
on	1
consumption.	1
If	1
these	1
remarks	1
have	1
any	1
foundation,	1
that	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
which	1
will	1
best	1
enable	1
us	1
to	1
improve	1
and	1
extend	1
so	1
valuable	1
a	1
resource	1
must	1
be	1
best	1
adapted	1
to	1
our	1
political	1
welfare.	1
And	1
it	1
cannot	1
admit	1
of	1
a	1
serious	1
doubt,	1
that	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
must	1
rest	1
on	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
Union.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
conducive	1
to	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
commerce,	1
so	1
far	1
it	1
must	1
tend	1
to	1
the	1
extension	1
of	1
the	1
revenue	1
to	1
be	1
drawn	1
from	1
that	1
source.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
contribute	1
to	1
rendering	1
regulations	1
for	1
the	1
collection	1
of	1
the	1
duties	1
more	1
simple	1
and	1
efficacious,	1
so	1
far	1
it	1
must	1
serve	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
purposes	1
of	1
making	1
the	1
same	1
rate	1
of	1
duties	1
more	1
productive,	1
and	1
of	1
putting	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
increase	1
the	1
rate	1
without	1
prejudice	1
to	1
trade.	1
The	1
relative	1
situation	1
of	1
these	1
States;	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
rivers	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
intersected,	1
and	1
of	1
bays	1
that	1
wash	1
there	1
shores;	1
the	1
facility	1
of	1
communication	1
in	1
every	1
direction;	1
the	1
affinity	1
of	1
language	1
and	1
manners;	1
the	1
familiar	1
habits	1
of	1
intercourse;	1
--all	1
these	1
are	1
circumstances	1
that	1
would	1
conspire	1
to	1
render	1
an	1
illicit	1
trade	1
between	1
them	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
little	1
difficulty,	1
and	1
would	1
insure	1
frequent	1
evasions	1
of	1
the	1
commercial	1
regulations	1
of	1
each	1
other.	1
The	1
separate	1
States	1
or	1
confederacies	1
would	1
be	1
necessitated	1
by	1
mutual	1
jealousy	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
temptations	1
to	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
trade	1
by	1
the	1
lowness	1
of	1
their	1
duties.	1
The	1
temper	1
of	1
our	1
governments,	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
would	1
not	1
permit	1
those	1
rigorous	1
precautions	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
European	1
nations	1
guard	1
the	1
avenues	1
into	1
their	1
respective	1
countries,	1
as	1
well	1
by	1
land	1
as	1
by	1
water;	1
and	1
which,	1
even	1
there,	1
are	1
found	1
insufficient	1
obstacles	1
to	1
the	1
adventurous	1
stratagems	1
of	1
avarice.	1
In	1
France,	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
patrols	1
(as	1
they	1
are	1
called)	1
constantly	1
employed	1
to	1
secure	1
their	1
fiscal	1
regulations	1
against	1
the	1
inroads	1
of	1
the	1
dealers	1
in	1
contraband	1
trade.	1
Mr.	1
Neckar	1
computes	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
these	1
patrols	1
at	1
upwards	1
of	1
twenty	1
thousand.	1
This	1
shows	1
the	1
immense	1
difficulty	1
in	1
preventing	1
that	1
species	1
of	1
traffic,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
inland	1
communication,	1
and	1
places	1
in	1
a	1
strong	1
light	1
the	1
disadvantages	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
collection	1
of	1
duties	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
would	1
be	1
encumbered,	1
if	1
by	1
disunion	1
the	1
States	1
should	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
a	1
situation,	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
resembling	1
that	1
of	1
France	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
her	1
neighbors.	1
The	1
arbitrary	1
and	1
vexatious	1
powers	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
patrols	1
are	1
necessarily	1
armed,	1
would	1
be	1
intolerable	1
in	1
a	1
free	1
country.	1
If,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
there	1
be	1
but	1
one	1
government	1
pervading	1
all	1
the	1
States,	1
there	1
will	1
be,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
principal	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
commerce,	1
but	1
ONE	1
SIDE	1
to	1
guard--the	1
ATLANTIC	1
COAST.	1
Vessels	1
arriving	1
directly	1
from	1
foreign	1
countries,	1
laden	1
with	1
valuable	1
cargoes,	1
would	1
rarely	1
choose	1
to	1
hazard	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
complicated	1
and	1
critical	1
perils	1
which	1
would	1
attend	1
attempts	1
to	1
unlade	1
prior	1
to	1
their	1
coming	1
into	1
port.	1
They	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
dread	1
both	1
the	1
dangers	1
of	1
the	1
coast,	1
and	1
of	1
detection,	1
as	1
well	1
after	1
as	1
before	1
their	1
arrival	1
at	1
the	1
places	1
of	1
their	1
final	1
destination.	1
An	1
ordinary	1
degree	1
of	1
vigilance	1
would	1
be	1
competent	1
to	1
the	1
prevention	1
of	1
any	1
material	1
infractions	1
upon	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
revenue.	1
A	1
few	1
armed	1
vessels,	1
judiciously	1
stationed	1
at	1
the	1
entrances	1
of	1
our	1
ports,	1
might	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
expense	1
be	1
made	1
useful	1
sentinels	1
of	1
the	1
laws.	1
And	1
the	1
government	1
having	1
the	1
same	1
interest	1
to	1
provide	1
against	1
violations	1
everywhere,	1
the	1
co-operation	1
of	1
its	1
measures	1
in	1
each	1
State	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
powerful	1
tendency	1
to	1
render	1
them	1
effectual.	1
Here	1
also	1
we	1
should	1
preserve	1
by	1
Union,	1
an	1
advantage	1
which	1
nature	1
holds	1
out	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
relinquished	1
by	1
separation.	1
The	1
United	1
States	1
lie	1
at	1
a	1
great	1
distance	1
from	1
Europe,	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
considerable	1
distance	1
from	1
all	1
other	1
places	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
extensive	1
connections	1
of	1
foreign	1
trade.	1
The	1
passage	1
from	1
them	1
to	1
us,	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
hours,	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
night,	1
as	1
between	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
France	1
and	1
Britain,	1
and	1
of	1
other	1
neighboring	1
nations,	1
would	1
be	1
impracticable.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
prodigious	1
security	1
against	1
a	1
direct	1
contraband	1
with	1
foreign	1
countries;	1
but	1
a	1
circuitous	1
contraband	1
to	1
one	1
State,	1
through	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
another,	1
would	1
be	1
both	1
easy	1
and	1
safe.	1
The	1
difference	1
between	1
a	1
direct	1
importation	1
from	1
abroad,	1
and	1
an	1
indirect	1
importation	1
through	1
the	1
channel	1
of	1
a	1
neighboring	1
State,	1
in	1
small	1
parcels,	1
according	1
to	1
time	1
and	1
opportunity,	1
with	1
the	1
additional	1
facilities	1
of	1
inland	1
communication,	1
must	1
be	1
palpable	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
of	1
discernment.	1
It	1
is	1
therefore	1
evident,	1
that	1
one	1
national	1
government	1
would	1
be	1
able,	1
at	1
much	1
less	1
expense,	1
to	1
extend	1
the	1
duties	1
on	1
imports,	1
beyond	1
comparison,	1
further	1
than	1
would	1
be	1
practicable	1
to	1
the	1
States	1
separately,	1
or	1
to	1
any	1
partial	1
confederacies.	1
Hitherto,	1
I	1
believe,	1
it	1
may	1
safely	1
be	1
asserted,	1
that	1
these	1
duties	1
have	1
not	1
upon	1
an	1
average	1
exceeded	1
in	1
any	1
State	1
three	1
per	1
cent.	1
In	1
France	1
they	1
are	1
estimated	1
to	1
be	1
about	1
fifteen	1
per	1
cent.,	1
and	1
in	1
Britain	1
they	1
exceed	1
this	1
proportion.1	1
There	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
nothing	1
to	1
hinder	1
their	1
being	1
increased	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
to	1
at	1
least	1
treble	1
their	1
present	1
amount.	1
The	1
single	1
article	1
of	1
ardent	1
spirits,	1
under	1
federal	1
regulation,	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
furnish	1
a	1
considerable	1
revenue.	1
Upon	1
a	1
ratio	1
to	1
the	1
importation	1
into	1
this	1
State,	1
the	1
whole	1
quantity	1
imported	1
into	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
may	1
be	1
estimated	1
at	1
four	1
millions	1
of	1
gallons;	1
which,	1
at	1
a	1
shilling	1
per	1
gallon,	1
would	1
produce	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
pounds.	1
That	1
article	1
would	1
well	1
bear	1
this	1
rate	1
of	1
duty;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
tend	1
to	1
diminish	1
the	1
consumption	1
of	1
it,	1
such	1
an	1
effect	1
would	1
be	1
equally	1
favorable	1
to	1
the	1
agriculture,	1
to	1
the	1
economy,	1
to	1
the	1
morals,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
society.	1
There	1
is,	1
perhaps,	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
national	1
extravagance	1
as	1
these	1
spirits.	1
What	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
consequence,	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
avail	1
ourselves	1
of	1
the	1
resource	1
in	1
question	1
in	1
its	1
full	1
extent?	1
A	1
nation	1
cannot	1
long	1
exist	1
without	1
revenues.	1
Destitute	1
of	1
this	1
essential	1
support,	1
it	1
must	1
resign	1
its	1
independence,	1
and	1
sink	1
into	1
the	1
degraded	1
condition	1
of	1
a	1
province.	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
extremity	1
to	1
which	1
no	1
government	1
will	1
of	1
choice	1
accede.	1
Revenue,	1
therefore,	1
must	1
be	1
had	1
at	1
all	1
events.	1
In	1
this	1
country,	1
if	1
the	1
principal	1
part	1
be	1
not	1
drawn	1
from	1
commerce,	1
it	1
must	1
fall	1
with	1
oppressive	1
weight	1
upon	1
land.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
intimated	1
that	1
excises,	1
in	1
their	1
true	1
signification,	1
are	1
too	1
little	1
in	1
unison	1
with	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
to	1
admit	1
of	1
great	1
use	1
being	1
made	1
of	1
that	1
mode	1
of	1
taxation;	1
nor,	1
indeed,	1
in	1
the	1
States	1
where	1
almost	1
the	1
sole	1
employment	1
is	1
agriculture,	1
are	1
the	1
objects	1
proper	1
for	1
excise	1
sufficiently	1
numerous	1
to	1
permit	1
very	1
ample	1
collections	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
Personal	1
estate	1
(as	1
has	1
been	1
before	1
remarked),	1
from	1
the	1
difficulty	1
in	1
tracing	1
it,	1
cannot	1
be	1
subjected	1
to	1
large	1
contributions,	1
by	1
any	1
other	1
means	1
than	1
by	1
taxes	1
on	1
consumption.	1
In	1
populous	1
cities,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
enough	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
conjecture,	1
to	1
occasion	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
individuals,	1
without	1
much	1
aggregate	1
benefit	1
to	1
the	1
State;	1
but	1
beyond	1
these	1
circles,	1
it	1
must,	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure,	1
escape	1
the	1
eye	1
and	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
tax-gatherer.	1
As	1
the	1
necessities	1
of	1
the	1
State,	1
nevertheless,	1
must	1
be	1
satisfied	1
in	1
some	1
mode	1
or	1
other,	1
the	1
defect	1
of	1
other	1
resources	1
must	1
throw	1
the	1
principal	1
weight	1
of	1
public	1
burdens	1
on	1
the	1
possessors	1
of	1
land.	1
And	1
as,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
the	1
wants	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
can	1
never	1
obtain	1
an	1
adequate	1
supply,	1
unless	1
all	1
the	1
sources	1
of	1
revenue	1
are	1
open	1
to	1
its	1
demands,	1
the	1
finances	1
of	1
the	1
community,	1
under	1
such	1
embarrassments,	1
cannot	1
be	1
put	1
into	1
a	1
situation	1
consistent	1
with	1
its	1
respectability	1
or	1
its	1
security.	1
Thus	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
even	1
have	1
the	1
consolations	1
of	1
a	1
full	1
treasury,	1
to	1
atone	1
for	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
that	1
valuable	1
class	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
who	1
are	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
cultivation	1
of	1
the	1
soil.	1
But	1
public	1
and	1
private	1
distress	1
will	1
keep	1
pace	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
gloomy	1
concert;	1
and	1
unite	1
in	1
deploring	1
the	1
infatuation	1
of	1
those	1
counsels	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
disunion.	1
PUBLIUS.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
As	1
CONNECTED	1
with	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
revenue,	1
we	1
may	1
with	1
propriety	1
consider	1
that	1
of	1
economy.	1
The	1
money	1
saved	1
from	1
one	1
object	1
may	1
be	1
usefully	1
applied	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
less	1
to	1
be	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
pockets	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
If	1
the	1
States	1
are	1
united	1
under	1
one	1
government,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
but	1
one	1
national	1
civil	1
list	1
to	1
support;	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
divided	1
into	1
several	1
confederacies,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
many	1
different	1
national	1
civil	1
lists	1
to	1
be	1
provided	1
for--and	1
each	1
of	1
them,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
principal	1
departments,	1
coextensive	1
with	1
that	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
for	1
a	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
whole.	1
The	1
entire	1
separation	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
into	1
thirteen	1
unconnected	1
sovereignties	1
is	1
a	1
project	1
too	1
extravagant	1
and	1
too	1
replete	1
with	1
danger	1
to	1
have	1
many	1
advocates.	1
The	1
ideas	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
speculate	1
upon	1
the	1
dismemberment	1
of	1
the	1
empire	1
seem	1
generally	1
turned	1
toward	1
three	1
confederacies--one	1
consisting	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
Northern,	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
Middle,	1
and	1
a	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
five	1
Southern	1
States.	1
There	1
is	1
little	1
probability	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
greater	1
number.	1
According	1
to	1
this	1
distribution,	1
each	1
confederacy	1
would	1
comprise	1
an	1
extent	1
of	1
territory	1
larger	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain.	1
No	1
well-informed	1
man	1
will	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
confederacy	1
can	1
be	1
properly	1
regulated	1
by	1
a	1
government	1
less	1
comprehensive	1
in	1
its	1
organs	1
or	1
institutions	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
proposed	1
by	1
the	1
convention.	1
When	1
the	1
dimensions	1
of	1
a	1
State	1
attain	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
magnitude,	1
it	1
requires	1
the	1
same	1
energy	1
of	1
government	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
forms	1
of	1
administration	1
which	1
are	1
requisite	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
much	1
greater	1
extent.	1
This	1
idea	1
admits	1
not	1
of	1
precise	1
demonstration,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
rule	1
by	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
measure	1
the	1
momentum	1
of	1
civil	1
power	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
any	1
given	1
number	1
of	1
individuals;	1
but	1
when	1
we	1
consider	1
that	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Britain,	1
nearly	1
commensurate	1
with	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
supposed	1
confederacies,	1
contains	1
about	1
eight	1
millions	1
of	1
people,	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
reflect	1
upon	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
authority	1
required	1
to	1
direct	1
the	1
passions	1
of	1
so	1
large	1
a	1
society	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
good,	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
like	1
portion	1
of	1
power	1
would	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
same	1
task	1
in	1
a	1
society	1
far	1
more	1
numerous.	1
Civil	1
power,	1
properly	1
organized	1
and	1
exerted,	1
is	1
capable	1
of	1
diffusing	1
its	1
force	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
extent;	1
and	1
can,	1
in	1
a	1
manner,	1
reproduce	1
itself	1
in	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
empire	1
by	1
a	1
judicious	1
arrangement	1
of	1
subordinate	1
institutions.	1
The	1
supposition	1
that	1
each	1
confederacy	1
into	1
which	1
the	1
States	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
divided	1
would	1
require	1
a	1
government	1
not	1
less	1
comprehensive	1
than	1
the	1
one	1
proposed,	1
will	1
be	1
strengthened	1
by	1
another	1
supposition,	1
more	1
probable	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
presents	1
us	1
with	1
three	1
confederacies	1
as	1
the	1
alternative	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
Union.	1
If	1
we	1
attend	1
carefully	1
to	1
geographical	1
and	1
commercial	1
considerations,	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
the	1
habits	1
and	1
prejudices	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
States,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
conclude	1
that	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
disunion	1
they	1
will	1
most	1
naturally	1
league	1
themselves	1
under	1
two	1
governments.	1
The	1
four	1
Eastern	1
States,	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
causes	1
that	1
form	1
the	1
links	1
of	1
national	1
sympathy	1
and	1
connection,	1
may	1
with	1
certainty	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
unite.	1
New	1
York,	1
situated	1
as	1
she	1
is,	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
unwise	1
enough	1
to	1
oppose	1
a	1
feeble	1
and	1
unsupported	1
flank	1
to	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
that	1
confederacy.	1
There	1
are	1
other	1
obvious	1
reasons	1
that	1
would	1
facilitate	1
her	1
accession	1
to	1
it.	1
New	1
Jersey	1
is	1
too	1
small	1
a	1
State	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
frontier,	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
this	1
still	1
more	1
powerful	1
combination;	1
nor	1
do	1
there	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
any	1
obstacles	1
to	1
her	1
admission	1
into	1
it.	1
Even	1
Pennsylvania	1
would	1
have	1
strong	1
inducements	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
Northern	1
league.	1
An	1
active	1
foreign	1
commerce,	1
on	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
navigation,	1
is	1
her	1
true	1
policy,	1
and	1
coincides	1
with	1
the	1
opinions	1
and	1
dispositions	1
of	1
her	1
citizens.	1
The	1
more	1
Southern	1
States,	1
from	1
various	1
circumstances,	1
may	1
not	1
think	1
themselves	1
much	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
encouragement	1
of	1
navigation.	1
They	1
may	1
prefer	1
a	1
system	1
which	1
would	1
give	1
unlimited	1
scope	1
to	1
all	1
nations	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
carriers	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
purchasers	1
of	1
their	1
commodities.	1
Pennsylvania	1
may	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
confound	1
her	1
interests	1
in	1
a	1
connection	1
so	1
adverse	1
to	1
her	1
policy.	1
As	1
she	1
must	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
be	1
a	1
frontier,	1
she	1
may	1
deem	1
it	1
most	1
consistent	1
with	1
her	1
safety	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
exposed	1
side	1
turned	1
towards	1
the	1
weaker	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Southern,	1
rather	1
than	1
towards	1
the	1
stronger	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Northern,	1
Confederacy.	1
This	1
would	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
fairest	1
chance	1
to	1
avoid	1
being	1
the	1
Flanders	1
of	1
America.	1
Whatever	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
determination	1
of	1
Pennsylvania,	1
if	1
the	1
Northern	1
Confederacy	1
includes	1
New	1
Jersey,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
likelihood	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
confederacy	1
to	1
the	1
south	1
of	1
that	1
State.	1
Nothing	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
evident	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
thirteen	1
States	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
support	1
a	1
national	1
government	1
better	1
than	1
one	1
half,	1
or	1
one	1
third,	1
or	1
any	1
number	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
whole.	1
This	1
reflection	1
must	1
have	1
great	1
weight	1
in	1
obviating	1
that	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
proposed	1
plan,	1
which	1
is	1
founded	1
on	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
expense;	1
an	1
objection,	1
however,	1
which,	1
when	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
nearer	1
view	1
of	1
it,	1
will	1
appear	1
in	1
every	1
light	1
to	1
stand	1
on	1
mistaken	1
ground.	1
If,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
a	1
plurality	1
of	1
civil	1
lists,	1
we	1
take	1
into	1
view	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
persons	1
who	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
employed	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
inland	1
communication	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
confederacies	1
against	1
illicit	1
trade,	1
and	1
who	1
in	1
time	1
will	1
infallibly	1
spring	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
necessities	1
of	1
revenue;	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
also	1
take	1
into	1
view	1
the	1
military	1
establishments	1
which	1
it	1
has	1

MADISON	1
To	1
the	1

York:	1
WE	1
HAVE	1
seen	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
as	1
our	1
bulwark	1
against	1
foreign	1
danger,	1
as	1
the	1
conservator	1
of	1
peace	1
among	1
ourselves,	1
as	1
the	1
guardian	1
of	1
our	1
commerce	1
and	1
other	1
common	1
interests,	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
substitute	1
for	1
those	1
military	1
establishments	1
which	1
have	1
subverted	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
the	1
Old	1
World,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
proper	1
antidote	1
for	1
the	1
diseases	1
of	1
faction,	1
which	1
have	1
proved	1
fatal	1
to	1
other	1
popular	1
governments,	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
alarming	1
symptoms	1
have	1
been	1
betrayed	1
by	1
our	1
own.	1
All	1
that	1
remains,	1
within	1
this	1
branch	1
of	1
our	1
inquiries,	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
notice	1
of	1
an	1
objection	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
great	1
extent	1
of	1
country	1
which	1
the	1
Union	1
embraces.	1
A	1
few	1
observations	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
more	1
proper,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
adversaries	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution	1
are	1
availing	1
themselves	1
of	1
the	1
prevailing	1
prejudice	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
practicable	1
sphere	1
of	1
republican	1
administration,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
supply,	1
by	1
imaginary	1
difficulties,	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
those	1
solid	1
objections	1
which	1
they	1
endeavor	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
find.	1
The	1
error	1
which	1
limits	1
republican	1
government	1
to	1
a	1
narrow	1
district	1
has	1
been	1
unfolded	1
and	1
refuted	1
in	1
preceding	1
papers.	1
I	1
remark	1
here	1
only	1
that	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
owe	1
its	1
rise	1
and	1
prevalence	1
chiefly	1
to	1
the	1
confounding	1
of	1
a	1
republic	1
with	1
a	1
democracy,	1
applying	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
reasonings	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
true	1
distinction	1
between	1
these	1
forms	1
was	1
also	1
adverted	1
to	1
on	1
a	1
former	1
occasion.	1
It	1
is,	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
democracy,	1
the	1
people	1
meet	1
and	1
exercise	1
the	1
government	1
in	1
person;	1
in	1
a	1
republic,	1
they	1
assemble	1
and	1
administer	1
it	1
by	1
their	1
representatives	1
and	1
agents.	1
A	1
democracy,	1
consequently,	1
will	1
be	1
confined	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
spot.	1
A	1
republic	1
may	1
be	1
extended	1
over	1
a	1
large	1
region.	1
To	1
this	1
accidental	1
source	1
of	1
the	1
error	1
may	1
be	1
added	1
the	1
artifice	1
of	1
some	1
celebrated	1
authors,	1
whose	1
writings	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
share	1
in	1
forming	1
the	1
modern	1
standard	1
of	1
political	1
opinions.	1
Being	1
subjects	1
either	1
of	1
an	1
absolute	1
or	1
limited	1
monarchy,	1
they	1
have	1
endeavored	1
to	1
heighten	1
the	1
advantages,	1
or	1
palliate	1
the	1
evils	1
of	1
those	1
forms,	1
by	1
placing	1
in	1
comparison	1
the	1
vices	1
and	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
republican,	1
and	1
by	1
citing	1
as	1
specimens	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
the	1
turbulent	1
democracies	1
of	1
ancient	1
Greece	1
and	1
modern	1
Italy.	1
Under	1
the	1
confusion	1
of	1
names,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
an	1
easy	1
task	1
to	1
transfer	1
to	1
a	1
republic	1
observations	1
applicable	1
to	1
a	1
democracy	1
only;	1
and	1
among	1
others,	1
the	1
observation	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
established	1
but	1
among	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
people,	1
living	1
within	1
a	1
small	1
compass	1
of	1
territory.	1
Such	1
a	1
fallacy	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
less	1
perceived,	1
as	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
popular	1
governments	1
of	1
antiquity	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
democratic	1
species;	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
modern	1
Europe,	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
owe	1
the	1
great	1
principle	1
of	1
representation,	1
no	1
example	1
is	1
seen	1
of	1
a	1
government	1
wholly	1
popular,	1
and	1
founded,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
wholly	1
on	1
that	1
principle.	1
If	1
Europe	1
has	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
discovering	1
this	1
great	1
mechanical	1
power	1
in	1
government,	1
by	1
the	1
simple	1
agency	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
political	1
body	1
may	1
be	1
concentred,	1
and	1
its	1
force	1
directed	1
to	1
any	1
object	1
which	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
requires,	1
America	1
can	1
claim	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
making	1
the	1
discovery	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
unmixed	1
and	1
extensive	1
republics.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
lamented	1
that	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
citizens	1
should	1
wish	1
to	1
deprive	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
additional	1
merit	1
of	1
displaying	1
its	1
full	1
efficacy	1
in	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
comprehensive	1
system	1
now	1
under	1
her	1
consideration.	1
As	1
the	1
natural	1
limit	1
of	1
a	1
democracy	1
is	1
that	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
central	1
point	1
which	1
will	1
just	1
permit	1
the	1
most	1
remote	1
citizens	1
to	1
assemble	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
their	1
public	1
functions	1
demand,	1
and	1
will	1
include	1
no	1
greater	1
number	1
than	1
can	1
join	1
in	1
those	1
functions;	1
so	1
the	1
natural	1
limit	1
of	1
a	1
republic	1
is	1
that	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
centre	1
which	1
will	1
barely	1
allow	1
the	1
representatives	1
to	1
meet	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
public	1
affairs.	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
exceed	1
this	1
distance?	1
It	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
said	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
recollect	1
that	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
coast	1
is	1
the	1
longest	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
that	1
during	1
the	1
term	1
of	1
thirteen	1
years,	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
have	1
been	1
almost	1
continually	1
assembled,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
from	1
the	1
most	1
distant	1
States	1
are	1
not	1
chargeable	1
with	1
greater	1
intermissions	1
of	1
attendance	1
than	1
those	1
from	1
the	1
States	1
in	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
of	1
Congress.	1
That	1
we	1
may	1
form	1
a	1
juster	1
estimate	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
interesting	1
subject,	1
let	1
us	1
resort	1
to	1
the	1
actual	1
dimensions	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
The	1
limits,	1
as	1
fixed	1
by	1
the	1
treaty	1
of	1
peace,	1
are:	1
on	1
the	1
east	1
the	1
Atlantic,	1
on	1
the	1
south	1
the	1
latitude	1
of	1
thirty-one	1
degrees,	1
on	1
the	1
west	1
the	1
Mississippi,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
north	1
an	1
irregular	1
line	1
running	1
in	1
some	1
instances	1
beyond	1
the	1
forty-fifth	1
degree,	1
in	1
others	1
falling	1
as	1
low	1
as	1
the	1
forty-second.	1
The	1
southern	1
shore	1
of	1
Lake	1
Erie	1
lies	1
below	1
that	1
latitude.	1
Computing	1
the	1
distance	1
between	1
the	1
thirty-first	1
and	1
forty-fifth	1
degrees,	1
it	1
amounts	1
to	1
nine	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy-three	1
common	1
miles;	1
computing	1
it	1
from	1
thirty-one	1
to	1
forty-two	1
degrees,	1
to	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty-four	1
miles	1
and	1
a	1
half.	1
Taking	1
the	1
mean	1
for	1
the	1
distance,	1
the	1
amount	1
will	1
be	1
eight	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty-eight	1
miles	1
and	1
three-fourths.	1
The	1
mean	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
to	1
the	1
Mississippi	1
does	1
not	1
probably	1
exceed	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
miles.	1
On	1
a	1
comparison	1
of	1
this	1
extent	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
several	1
countries	1
in	1
Europe,	1
the	1
practicability	1
of	1
rendering	1
our	1
system	1
commensurate	1
to	1
it	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
demonstrable.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
larger	1
than	1
Germany,	1
where	1
a	1
diet	1
representing	1
the	1
whole	1
empire	1
is	1
continually	1
assembled;	1
or	1
than	1
Poland	1
before	1
the	1
late	1
dismemberment,	1
where	1
another	1
national	1
diet	1
was	1
the	1
depositary	1
of	1
the	1
supreme	1
power.	1
Passing	1
by	1
France	1
and	1
Spain,	1
we	1
find	1
that	1
in	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
inferior	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
size,	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
northern	1
extremity	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
have	1
as	1
far	1
to	1
travel	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
council	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
required	1
of	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
remote	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
Favorable	1
as	1
this	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
may	1
be,	1
some	1
observations	1
remain	1
which	1
will	1
place	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
light	1
still	1
more	1
satisfactory.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
remembered	1
that	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
charged	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
and	1
administering	1
laws.	1
Its	1
jurisdiction	1
is	1
limited	1
to	1
certain	1
enumerated	1
objects,	1
which	1
concern	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
republic,	1
but	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
attained	1
by	1
the	1
separate	1
provisions	1
of	1
any.	1
The	1
subordinate	1
governments,	1
which	1
can	1
extend	1
their	1
care	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
other	1
subjects	1
which	1
can	1
be	1
separately	1
provided	1
for,	1
will	1
retain	1
their	1
due	1
authority	1
and	1
activity.	1
Were	1
it	1
proposed	1
by	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
to	1
abolish	1
the	1
governments	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
States,	1
its	1
adversaries	1
would	1
have	1
some	1
ground	1
for	1
their	1
objection;	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
abolished	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
would	1
be	1
compelled,	1
by	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
self-preservation,	1
to	1
reinstate	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
proper	1
jurisdiction.	1
A	1
second	1
observation	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
immediate	1
object	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution	1
is	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
union	1
of	1
the	1
thirteen	1
primitive	1
States,	1
which	1
we	1
know	1
to	1
be	1
practicable;	1
and	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
them	1
such	1
other	1
States	1
as	1
may	1
arise	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
bosoms,	1
or	1
in	1
their	1
neighborhoods,	1
which	1
we	1
cannot	1
doubt	1
to	1
be	1
equally	1
practicable.	1
The	1
arrangements	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
necessary	1
for	1
those	1
angles	1
and	1
fractions	1
of	1
our	1
territory	1
which	1
lie	1
on	1
our	1
northwestern	1
frontier,	1
must	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
those	1
whom	1
further	1
discoveries	1
and	1
experience	1
will	1
render	1
more	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
task.	1
Let	1
it	1
be	1
remarked,	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
place,	1
that	1
the	1
intercourse	1
throughout	1
the	1
Union	1
will	1
be	1
facilitated	1
by	1
new	1
improvements.	1
Roads	1
will	1
everywhere	1
be	1
shortened,	1
and	1
kept	1
in	1
better	1
order;	1
accommodations	1
for	1
travelers	1
will	1
be	1
multiplied	1
and	1
meliorated;	1
an	1
interior	1
navigation	1
on	1
our	1
eastern	1
side	1
will	1
be	1
opened	1
throughout,	1
or	1
nearly	1
throughout,	1
the	1
whole	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
thirteen	1
States.	1
The	1
communication	1
between	1
the	1
Western	1
and	1
Atlantic	1
districts,	1
and	1
between	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
each,	1
will	1
be	1
rendered	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
easy	1
by	1
those	1
numerous	1
canals	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
beneficence	1
of	1
nature	1
has	1
intersected	1
our	1
country,	1
and	1
which	1
art	1
finds	1
it	1
so	1
little	1
difficult	1
to	1
connect	1
and	1
complete.	1
A	1
fourth	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
important	1
consideration	1
is,	1
that	1
as	1
almost	1
every	1
State	1
will,	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
or	1
other,	1
be	1
a	1
frontier,	1
and	1
will	1
thus	1
find,	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
its	1
safety,	1
an	1
inducement	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
sacrifices	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
protection;	1
so	1
the	1
States	1
which	1
lie	1
at	1
the	1
greatest	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
which,	1
of	1
course,	1
may	1
partake	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
ordinary	1
circulation	1
of	1
its	1
benefits,	1
will	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
immediately	1
contiguous	1
to	1
foreign	1
nations,	1
and	1
will	1
consequently	1
stand,	1
on	1
particular	1
occasions,	1
in	1
greatest	1
need	1
of	1
its	1
strength	1
and	1
resources.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
inconvenient	1
for	1
Georgia,	1
or	1
the	1
States	1
forming	1
our	1
western	1
or	1
northeastern	1
borders,	1
to	1
send	1
their	1
representatives	1
to	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
government;	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
find	1
it	1
more	1
so	1
to	1
struggle	1
alone	1
against	1
an	1
invading	1
enemy,	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
support	1
alone	1
the	1
whole	1
expense	1
of	1
those	1
precautions	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
dictated	1
by	1
the	1
neighborhood	1
of	1
continual	1
danger.	1
If	1
they	1
should	1
derive	1
less	1
benefit,	1
therefore,	1
from	1
the	1
Union	1
in	1
some	1
respects	1
than	1
the	1
less	1
distant	1
States,	1
they	1
will	1
derive	1
greater	1
benefit	1
from	1
it	1
in	1
other	1
respects,	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
proper	1
equilibrium	1
will	1
be	1
maintained	1
throughout.	1
I	1
submit	1
to	1
you,	1
my	1
fellow-citizens,	1
these	1
considerations,	1
in	1
full	1
confidence	1
that	1
the	1
good	1
sense	1
which	1
has	1
so	1
often	1
marked	1
your	1
decisions	1
will	1
allow	1
them	1
their	1
due	1
weight	1
and	1
effect;	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
suffer	1
difficulties,	1
however	1
formidable	1
in	1
appearance,	1
or	1
however	1
fashionable	1
the	1
error	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
founded,	1
to	1
drive	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
gloomy	1
and	1
perilous	1
scene	1
into	1
which	1
the	1
advocates	1
for	1
disunion	1
would	1
conduct	1
you.	1
Hearken	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
unnatural	1
voice	1
which	1
tells	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America,	1
knit	1
together	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
by	1
so	1
many	1
cords	1
of	1
affection,	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
live	1
together	1
as	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
family;	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
continue	1
the	1
mutual	1
guardians	1
of	1
their	1
mutual	1
happiness;	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
fellowcitizens	1
of	1
one	1
great,	1
respectable,	1
and	1
flourishing	1
empire.	1
Hearken	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
voice	1
which	1
petulantly	1
tells	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
government	1
recommended	1
for	1
your	1
adoption	1
is	1
a	1
novelty	1
in	1
the	1
political	1
world;	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
never	1
yet	1
had	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
theories	1
of	1
the	1
wildest	1
projectors;	1
that	1
it	1
rashly	1
attempts	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
accomplish.	1
No,	1
my	1
countrymen,	1
shut	1
your	1
ears	1
against	1
this	1
unhallowed	1
language.	1
Shut	1
your	1
hearts	1
against	1
the	1
poison	1
which	1
it	1
conveys;	1
the	1
kindred	1
blood	1
which	1
flows	1
in	1
the	1
veins	1
of	1
American	1
citizens,	1
the	1
mingled	1
blood	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
shed	1
in	1
defense	1
of	1
their	1
sacred	1
rights,	1
consecrate	1
their	1
Union,	1
and	1
excite	1
horror	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
their	1
becoming	1
aliens,	1
rivals,	1
enemies.	1
And	1
if	1
novelties	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
shunned,	1
believe	1
me,	1
the	1
most	1
alarming	1
of	1
all	1
novelties,	1
the	1
most	1
wild	1
of	1
all	1
projects,	1
the	1
most	1
rash	1
of	1
all	1
attempts,	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
rendering	1
us	1
in	1
pieces,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
preserve	1
our	1
liberties	1
and	1
promote	1
our	1
happiness.	1
But	1
why	1
is	1
the	1
experiment	1
of	1
an	1
extended	1
republic	1
to	1
be	1
rejected,	1
merely	1
because	1
it	1
may	1
comprise	1
what	1
is	1
new?	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America,	1
that,	1
whilst	1
they	1
have	1
paid	1
a	1
decent	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
opinions	1
of	1
former	1
times	1
and	1
other	1
nations,	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
suffered	1
a	1
blind	1
veneration	1
for	1
antiquity,	1
for	1
custom,	1
or	1
for	1
names,	1
to	1
overrule	1
the	1
suggestions	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
good	1
sense,	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
situation,	1
and	1
the	1
lessons	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
experience?	1
To	1
this	1
manly	1
spirit,	1
posterity	1
will	1
be	1
indebted	1
for	1
the	1
possession,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
the	1
example,	1
of	1
the	1
numerous	1
innovations	1
displayed	1
on	1
the	1
American	1
theatre,	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
private	1
rights	1
and	1
public	1
happiness.	1
Had	1
no	1
important	1
step	1
been	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
leaders	1
of	1
the	1
Revolution	1
for	1
which	1
a	1
precedent	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
discovered,	1
no	1
government	1
established	1
of	1
which	1
an	1
exact	1
model	1
did	1
not	1
present	1
itself,	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
might,	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
have	1
been	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
melancholy	1
victims	1
of	1
misguided	1
councils,	1
must	1
at	1
best	1
have	1
been	1
laboring	1
under	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
forms	1
which	1
have	1
crushed	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
mankind.	1
Happily	1
for	1
America,	1
happily,	1
we	1
trust,	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
human	1
race,	1
they	1
pursued	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
more	1
noble	1
course.	1
They	1
accomplished	1
a	1
revolution	1
which	1
has	1
no	1
parallel	1
in	1
the	1
annals	1
of	1
human	1
society.	1
They	1
reared	1
the	1
fabrics	1
of	1
governments	1
which	1
have	1
no	1
model	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
globe.	1
They	1
formed	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
Confederacy,	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
incumbent	1
on	1
their	1
successors	1
to	1
improve	1
and	1
perpetuate.	1
If	1
their	1
works	1
betray	1
imperfections,	1
we	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
fewness	1
of	1
them.	1
If	1
they	1
erred	1
most	1
in	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
work	1
most	1
difficult	1
to	1
be	1
executed;	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
work	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
new	1
modelled	1
by	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
your	1
convention,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
act	1
on	1
which	1
you	1
are	1
now	1
to	1
deliberate	1
and	1
to	1
decide.	1

IN	1
THE	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
papers,	1
I	1
have	1
endeavored,	1
my	1
fellow-citizens,	1
to	1
place	1
before	1
you,	1
in	1
a	1
clear	1
and	1
convincing	1
light,	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
Union	1
to	1
your	1
political	1
safety	1
and	1
happiness.	1
I	1
have	1
unfolded	1
to	1
you	1
a	1
complication	1
of	1
dangers	1
to	1
which	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
exposed,	1
should	1
you	1
permit	1
that	1
sacred	1
knot	1
which	1
binds	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
together	1
be	1
severed	1
or	1
dissolved	1
by	1
ambition	1
or	1
by	1
avarice,	1
by	1
jealousy	1
or	1
by	1
misrepresentation.	1
In	1
the	1
sequel	1
of	1
the	1
inquiry	1
through	1
which	1
I	1
propose	1
to	1
accompany	1
you,	1
the	1
truths	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
inculcated	1
will	1
receive	1
further	1
confirmation	1
from	1
facts	1
and	1
arguments	1
hitherto	1
unnoticed.	1
If	1
the	1
road	1
over	1
which	1
you	1
will	1
still	1
have	1
to	1
pass	1
should	1
in	1
some	1
places	1
appear	1
to	1
you	1
tedious	1
or	1
irksome,	1
you	1
will	1
recollect	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
information	1
on	1
a	1
subject	1
the	1
most	1
momentous	1
which	1
can	1
engage	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
a	1
free	1
people,	1
that	1
the	1
field	1
through	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
travel	1
is	1
in	1
itself	1
spacious,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
difficulties	1
of	1
the	1
journey	1
have	1
been	1
unnecessarily	1
increased	1
by	1
the	1
mazes	1
with	1
which	1
sophistry	1
has	1
beset	1
the	1
way.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
aim	1
to	1
remove	1
the	1
obstacles	1
from	1
your	1
progress	1
in	1
as	1
compendious	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
done,	1
without	1
sacrificing	1
utility	1
to	1
despatch.	1
In	1
pursuance	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
down	1
for	1
the	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
subject,	1
the	1
point	1
next	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
examined	1
is	1
the	1
"insufficiency	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
Confederation	1
to	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
the	1
Union."	1
It	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
asked	1
what	1
need	1
there	1
is	1
of	1
reasoning	1
or	1
proof	1
to	1
illustrate	1
a	1
position	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
either	1
controverted	1
or	1
doubted,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
understandings	1
and	1
feelings	1
of	1
all	1
classes	1
of	1
men	1
assent,	1
and	1
which	1
in	1
substance	1
is	1
admitted	1
by	1
the	1
opponents	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution.	1
It	1
must	1
in	1
truth	1
be	1
acknowledged	1
that,	1
however	1
these	1
may	1
differ	1
in	1
other	1
respects,	1
they	1
in	1
general	1
appear	1
to	1
harmonize	1
in	1
this	1
sentiment,	1
at	1
least,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
material	1
imperfections	1
in	1
our	1
national	1
system,	1
and	1
that	1
something	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
rescue	1
us	1
from	1
impending	1
anarchy.	1
The	1
facts	1
that	1
support	1
this	1
opinion	1
are	1
no	1
longer	1
objects	1
of	1
speculation.	1
They	1
have	1
forced	1
themselves	1
upon	1
the	1
sensibility	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large,	1
and	1
have	1
at	1
length	1
extorted	1
from	1
those,	1
whose	1
mistaken	1
policy	1
has	1
had	1
the	1
principal	1
share	1
in	1
precipitating	1
the	1
extremity	1
at	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
arrived,	1
a	1
reluctant	1
confession	1
of	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
those	1
defects	1
in	1
the	1
scheme	1
of	1
our	1
federal	1
government,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
long	1
pointed	1
out	1
and	1
regretted	1
by	1
the	1
intelligent	1
friends	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
We	1
may	1
indeed	1
with	1
propriety	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
reached	1
almost	1
the	1
last	1
stage	1
of	1
national	1
humiliation.	1
There	1
is	1
scarcely	1
anything	1
that	1
can	1
wound	1
the	1
pride	1
or	1
degrade	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
an	1
independent	1
nation	1
which	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
experience.	1
Are	1
there	1
engagements	1
to	1
the	1
performance	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
held	1
by	1
every	1
tie	1
respectable	1
among	1
men?	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
subjects	1
of	1
constant	1
and	1
unblushing	1
violation.	1
Do	1
we	1
owe	1
debts	1
to	1
foreigners	1
and	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
citizens	1
contracted	1
in	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
imminent	1
peril	1
for	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
our	1
political	1
existence?	1
These	1
remain	1
without	1
any	1
proper	1
or	1
satisfactory	1
provision	1
for	1
their	1
discharge.	1
Have	1
we	1
valuable	1
territories	1
and	1
important	1
posts	1
in	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
foreign	1
power	1
which,	1
by	1
express	1
stipulations,	1
ought	1
long	1
since	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
surrendered?	1
These	1
are	1
still	1
retained,	1
to	1
the	1
prejudice	1
of	1
our	1
interests,	1
not	1
less	1
than	1
of	1
our	1
rights.	1
Are	1
we	1
in	1
a	1
condition	1
to	1
resent	1
or	1
to	1
repel	1
the	1
aggression?	1
We	1
have	1
neither	1
troops,	1
nor	1
treasury,	1
nor	1
government.1	1
Are	1
we	1
even	1
in	1
a	1
condition	1
to	1
remonstrate	1
with	1
dignity?	1
The	1
just	1
imputations	1
on	1
our	1
own	1
faith,	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
treaty,	1
ought	1
first	1
to	1
be	1
removed.	1
Are	1
we	1
entitled	1
by	1
nature	1
and	1
compact	1
to	1
a	1
free	1
participation	1
in	1
the	1
navigation	1
of	1
the	1
Mississippi?	1
Spain	1
excludes	1
us	1
from	1
it.	1
Is	1
public	1
credit	1
an	1
indispensable	1
resource	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
public	1
danger?	1
We	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
abandoned	1
its	1
cause	1
as	1
desperate	1
and	1
irretrievable.	1
Is	1
commerce	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
national	1
wealth?	1
Ours	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
lowest	1
point	1
of	1
declension.	1
Is	1
respectability	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
foreign	1
powers	1
a	1
safeguard	1
against	1
foreign	1
encroachments?	1
The	1
imbecility	1
of	1
our	1
government	1
even	1
forbids	1
them	1
to	1
treat	1
with	1
us.	1
Our	1
ambassadors	1
abroad	1
are	1
the	1
mere	1
pageants	1
of	1
mimic	1
sovereignty.	1
Is	1
a	1
violent	1
and	1
unnatural	1
decrease	1
in	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
land	1
a	1
symptom	1
of	1
national	1
distress?	1
The	1
price	1
of	1
improved	1
land	1
in	1
most	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
is	1
much	1
lower	1
than	1
can	1
be	1
accounted	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
waste	1
land	1
at	1
market,	1
and	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
fully	1
explained	1
by	1
that	1
want	1
of	1
private	1
and	1
public	1
confidence,	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
alarmingly	1
prevalent	1
among	1
all	1
ranks,	1
and	1
which	1
have	1
a	1
direct	1
tendency	1
to	1
depreciate	1
property	1
of	1
every	1
kind.	1
Is	1
private	1
credit	1
the	1
friend	1
and	1
patron	1
of	1
industry?	1
That	1
most	1
useful	1
kind	1
which	1
relates	1
to	1
borrowing	1
and	1
lending	1
is	1
reduced	1
within	1
the	1
narrowest	1
limits,	1
and	1
this	1
still	1
more	1
from	1
an	1
opinion	1
of	1
insecurity	1
than	1
from	1
the	1
scarcity	1
of	1
money.	1
To	1
shorten	1
an	1
enumeration	1
of	1
particulars	1
which	1
can	1
afford	1
neither	1
pleasure	1
nor	1
instruction,	1
it	1
may	1
in	1
general	1
be	1
demanded,	1
what	1
indication	1
is	1
there	1
of	1
national	1
disorder,	1
poverty,	1
and	1
insignificance	1
that	1
could	1
befall	1
a	1
community	1
so	1
peculiarly	1
blessed	1
with	1
natural	1
advantages	1
as	1
we	1
are,	1
which	1
does	1
not	1
form	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
catalogue	1
of	1
our	1
public	1
misfortunes?	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
melancholy	1
situation	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
by	1
those	1
very	1
maxims	1
and	1
councils	1
which	1
would	1
now	1
deter	1
us	1
from	1
adopting	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution;	1
and	1
which,	1
not	1
content	1
with	1
having	1
conducted	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
a	1
precipice,	1
seem	1
resolved	1
to	1
plunge	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
abyss	1
that	1
awaits	1
us	1
below.	1
Here,	1
my	1
countrymen,	1
impelled	1
by	1
every	1
motive	1
that	1
ought	1
to	1
influence	1
an	1
enlightened	1
people,	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
a	1
firm	1
stand	1
for	1
our	1
safety,	1
our	1
tranquillity,	1
our	1
dignity,	1
our	1
reputation.	1
Let	1
us	1
at	1
last	1
break	1
the	1
fatal	1
charm	1
which	1
has	1
too	1
long	1
seduced	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
felicity	1
and	1
prosperity.	1
It	1
is	1
true,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
before	1
observed	1
that	1
facts,	1
too	1
stubborn	1
to	1
be	1
resisted,	1
have	1
produced	1
a	1
species	1
of	1
general	1
assent	1
to	1
the	1
abstract	1
proposition	1
that	1
there	1
exist	1
material	1
defects	1
in	1
our	1
national	1
system;	1
but	1
the	1
usefulness	1
of	1
the	1
concession,	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
adversaries	1
of	1
federal	1
measures,	1
is	1
destroyed	1
by	1
a	1
strenuous	1
opposition	1
to	1
a	1
remedy,	1
upon	1
the	1
only	1
principles	1
that	1
can	1
give	1
it	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
success.	1
While	1
they	1
admit	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
is	1
destitute	1
of	1
energy,	1
they	1
contend	1
against	1
conferring	1
upon	1
it	1
those	1
powers	1
which	1
are	1
requisite	1
to	1
supply	1
that	1
energy.	1
They	1
seem	1
still	1
to	1
aim	1
at	1
things	1
repugnant	1
and	1
irreconcilable;	1
at	1
an	1
augmentation	1
of	1
federal	1
authority,	1
without	1
a	1
diminution	1
of	1
State	1
authority;	1
at	1
sovereignty	1
in	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
complete	1
independence	1
in	1
the	1
members.	1
They	1
still,	1
in	1
fine,	1
seem	1
to	1
cherish	1
with	1
blind	1
devotion	1
the	1
political	1
monster	1
of	1
an	1
imperium	1
in	1
imperio.	1
This	1
renders	1
a	1
full	1
display	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation	1
necessary,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
evils	1
we	1
experience	1
do	1
not	1
proceed	1
from	1
minute	1
or	1
partial	1
imperfections,	1
but	1
from	1
fundamental	1
errors	1
in	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
building,	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
amended	1
otherwise	1
than	1
by	1
an	1
alteration	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
principles	1
and	1
main	1
pillars	1
of	1
the	1
fabric.	1
The	1
great	1
and	1
radical	1
vice	1
in	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
existing	1
Confederation	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
LEGISLATION	1
for	1
STATES	1
or	1
GOVERNMENTS,	1
in	1
their	1
CORPORATE	1
or	1
COLLECTIVE	1
CAPACITIES,	1
and	1
as	1
contradistinguished	1
from	1
the	1
INDIVIDUALS	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
consist.	1
Though	1
this	1
principle	1
does	1
not	1
run	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
delegated	1
to	1
the	1
Union,	1
yet	1
it	1
pervades	1
and	1
governs	1
those	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
depends.	1
Except	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
rule	1
of	1
appointment,	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
has	1
an	1
indefinite	1
discretion	1
to	1
make	1
requisitions	1
for	1
men	1
and	1
money;	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
authority	1
to	1
raise	1
either,	1
by	1
regulations	1
extending	1
to	1
the	1
individual	1
citizens	1
of	1
America.	1
The	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
is,	1
that	1
though	1
in	1
theory	1
their	1
resolutions	1
concerning	1
those	1
objects	1
are	1
laws,	1
constitutionally	1
binding	1
on	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
yet	1
in	1
practice	1
they	1
are	1
mere	1
recommendations	1
which	1
the	1
States	1
observe	1
or	1
disregard	1
at	1
their	1
option.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
singular	1
instance	1
of	1
the	1
capriciousness	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
mind,	1
that	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
admonitions	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
from	1
experience	1
on	1
this	1
head,	1
there	1
should	1
still	1
be	1
found	1
men	1
who	1
object	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution,	1
for	1
deviating	1
from	1
a	1
principle	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
the	1
bane	1
of	1
the	1
old,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
itself	1
evidently	1
incompatible	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
GOVERNMENT;	1
a	1
principle,	1
in	1
short,	1
which,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
executed	1
at	1
all,	1
must	1
substitute	1
the	1
violent	1
and	1
sanguinary	1
agency	1
of	1
the	1
sword	1
to	1
the	1
mild	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
magistracy.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
absurd	1
or	1
impracticable	1
in	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
league	1
or	1
alliance	1
between	1
independent	1
nations	1
for	1
certain	1
defined	1
purposes	1
precisely	1
stated	1
in	1
a	1
treaty	1
regulating	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
of	1
time,	1
place,	1
circumstance,	1
and	1
quantity;	1
leaving	1
nothing	1
to	1
future	1
discretion;	1
and	1
depending	1
for	1
its	1
execution	1
on	1
the	1
good	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
parties.	1
Compacts	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
exist	1
among	1
all	1
civilized	1
nations,	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
vicissitudes	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
war,	1
of	1
observance	1
and	1
non-observance,	1
as	1
the	1
interests	1
or	1
passions	1
of	1
the	1
contracting	1
powers	1
dictate.	1
In	1
the	1
early	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
century	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
epidemical	1
rage	1
in	1
Europe	1
for	1
this	1
species	1
of	1
compacts,	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
politicians	1
of	1
the	1
times	1
fondly	1
hoped	1
for	1
benefits	1
which	1
were	1
never	1
realized.	1
With	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
establishing	1
the	1
equilibrium	1
of	1
power	1
and	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
all	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
negotiation	1
were	1
exhausted,	1
and	1
triple	1
and	1
quadruple	1
alliances	1
were	1
formed;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
scarcely	1
formed	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
broken,	1
giving	1
an	1
instructive	1
but	1
afflicting	1
lesson	1
to	1
mankind,	1
how	1
little	1
dependence	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
placed	1
on	1
treaties	1
which	1
have	1
no	1
other	1
sanction	1
than	1
the	1
obligations	1
of	1
good	1
faith,	1
and	1
which	1
oppose	1
general	1
considerations	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
justice	1
to	1
the	1
impulse	1
of	1
any	1
immediate	1
interest	1
or	1
passion.	1
If	1
the	1
particular	1
States	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
are	1
disposed	1
to	1
stand	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
relation	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
to	1
drop	1
the	1
project	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
DISCRETIONARY	1
SUPERINTENDENCE,	1
the	1
scheme	1
would	1
indeed	1
be	1
pernicious,	1
and	1
would	1
entail	1
upon	1
us	1
all	1
the	1
mischiefs	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
enumerated	1
under	1
the	1
first	1
head;	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
being,	1
at	1
least,	1
consistent	1
and	1
practicable	1
Abandoning	1
all	1
views	1
towards	1
a	1
confederate	1
government,	1
this	1
would	1
bring	1
us	1
to	1
a	1
simple	1
alliance	1
offensive	1
and	1
defensive;	1
and	1
would	1
place	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
situation	1
to	1
be	1
alternate	1
friends	1
and	1
enemies	1
of	1
each	1
other,	1
as	1
our	1
mutual	1
jealousies	1
and	1
rivalships,	1
nourished	1
by	1
the	1
intrigues	1
of	1
foreign	1
nations,	1
should	1
prescribe	1
to	1
us.	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
unwilling	1
to	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
this	1
perilous	1
situation;	1
if	1
we	1
still	1
will	1
adhere	1
to	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
a	1
national	1
government,	1
or,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
thing,	1
of	1
a	1
superintending	1
power,	1
under	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
council,	1
we	1
must	1
resolve	1
to	1
incorporate	1
into	1
our	1
plan	1
those	1
ingredients	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
forming	1
the	1
characteristic	1
difference	1
between	1
a	1
league	1
and	1
a	1
government;	1
we	1
must	1
extend	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
to	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
the	1
citizens,	1
--the	1
only	1
proper	1
objects	1
of	1
government.	1
Government	1
implies	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
laws.	1
It	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
law,	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
attended	1
with	1
a	1
sanction;	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
a	1
penalty	1
or	1
punishment	1
for	1
disobedience.	1
If	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
penalty	1
annexed	1
to	1
disobedience,	1
the	1
resolutions	1
or	1
commands	1
which	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
laws	1
will,	1
in	1
fact,	1
amount	1
to	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
advice	1
or	1
recommendation.	1
This	1
penalty,	1
whatever	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
inflicted	1
in	1
two	1
ways:	1
by	1
the	1
agency	1
of	1
the	1
courts	1
and	1
ministers	1
of	1
justice,	1
or	1
by	1
military	1
force;	1
by	1
the	1
COERCION	1
of	1
the	1
magistracy,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
COERCION	1
of	1
arms.	1
The	1
first	1
kind	1
can	1
evidently	1
apply	1
only	1
to	1
men;	1
the	1
last	1
kind	1
must	1
of	1
necessity,	1
be	1
employed	1
against	1
bodies	1
politic,	1
or	1
communities,	1
or	1
States.	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
process	1
of	1
a	1
court	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
observance	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
can,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
resort,	1
be	1
enforced.	1
Sentences	1
may	1
be	1
denounced	1
against	1
them	1
for	1
violations	1
of	1
their	1
duty;	1
but	1
these	1
sentences	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
execution	1
by	1
the	1
sword.	1
In	1
an	1
association	1
where	1
the	1
general	1
authority	1
is	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
collective	1
bodies	1
of	1
the	1
communities,	1
that	1
compose	1
it,	1
every	1
breach	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
must	1
involve	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
war;	1
and	1
military	1
execution	1
must	1
become	1
the	1
only	1
instrument	1
of	1
civil	1
obedience.	1
Such	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
can	1
certainly	1
not	1
deserve	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
government,	1
nor	1
would	1
any	1
prudent	1
man	1
choose	1
to	1
commit	1
his	1
happiness	1
to	1
it.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
told	1
that	1
breaches,	1
by	1
the	1
States,	1
of	1
the	1
regulations	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
authority	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
expected;	1
that	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
common	1
interest	1
would	1
preside	1
over	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
respective	1
members,	1
and	1
would	1
beget	1
a	1
full	1
compliance	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
constitutional	1
requisitions	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
This	1
language,	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
day,	1
would	1
appear	1
as	1
wild	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
now	1
hear	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
quarter	1
will	1
be	1
thought,	1
when	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
received	1
further	1
lessons	1
from	1
that	1
best	1
oracle	1
of	1
wisdom,	1
experience.	1
It	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
betrayed	1
an	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
springs	1
by	1
which	1
human	1
conduct	1
is	1
actuated,	1
and	1
belied	1
the	1
original	1
inducements	1
to	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
civil	1
power.	1
Why	1
has	1
government	1
been	1
instituted	1
at	1
all?	1
Because	1
the	1
passions	1
of	1
men	1
will	1
not	1
conform	1
to	1
the	1
dictates	1
of	1
reason	1
and	1
justice,	1
without	1
constraint.	1
Has	1
it	1
been	1
found	1
that	1
bodies	1
of	1
men	1
act	1
with	1
more	1
rectitude	1
or	1
greater	1
disinterestedness	1
than	1
individuals?	1
The	1
contrary	1
of	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
inferred	1
by	1
all	1
accurate	1
observers	1
of	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
mankind;	1
and	1
the	1
inference	1
is	1
founded	1
upon	1
obvious	1
reasons.	1
Regard	1
to	1
reputation	1
has	1
a	1
less	1
active	1
influence,	1
when	1
the	1
infamy	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
action	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
divided	1
among	1
a	1
number	1
than	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
fall	1
singly	1
upon	1
one.	1
A	1
spirit	1
of	1
faction,	1
which	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
mingle	1
its	1
poison	1
in	1
the	1
deliberations	1
of	1
all	1
bodies	1
of	1
men,	1
will	1
often	1
hurry	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
are	1
composed	1
into	1
improprieties	1
and	1
excesses,	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
would	1
blush	1
in	1
a	1
private	1
capacity.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
all	1
this,	1
there	1
is,	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
sovereign	1
power,	1
an	1
impatience	1
of	1
control,	1
that	1
disposes	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
invested	1
with	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
it,	1
to	1
look	1
with	1
an	1
evil	1
eye	1
upon	1
all	1
external	1
attempts	1
to	1
restrain	1
or	1
direct	1
its	1
operations.	1
From	1
this	1
spirit	1
it	1
happens,	1
that	1
in	1
every	1
political	1
association	1
which	1
is	1
formed	1
upon	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
uniting	1
in	1
a	1
common	1
interest	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
lesser	1
sovereignties,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
eccentric	1
tendency	1
in	1
the	1
subordinate	1
or	1
inferior	1
orbs,	1
by	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
perpetual	1
effort	1
in	1
each	1
to	1
fly	1
off	1
from	1
the	1
common	1
centre.	1
This	1
tendency	1
is	1
not	1
difficult	1
to	1
be	1
accounted	1
for.	1
It	1
has	1
its	1
origin	1
in	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
power.	1
Power	1
controlled	1
or	1
abridged	1
is	1
almost	1
always	1
the	1
rival	1
and	1
enemy	1
of	1
that	1
power	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
controlled	1
or	1
abridged.	1
This	1
simple	1
proposition	1
will	1
teach	1
us	1
how	1
little	1
reason	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
expect,	1
that	1
the	1
persons	1
intrusted	1
with	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
members	1
of	1
a	1
confederacy	1
will	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
be	1
ready,	1
with	1
perfect	1
good-humor,	1
and	1
an	1
unbiased	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
weal,	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
resolutions	1
or	1
decrees	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
authority.	1
The	1
reverse	1
of	1
this	1
results	1
from	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
human	1
nature.	1
If,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
measures	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy	1
cannot	1
be	1
executed	1
without	1
the	1
intervention	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
administrations,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
little	1
prospect	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
executed	1
at	1
all.	1
The	1
rulers	1
of	1
the	1
respective	1
members,	1
whether	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
constitutional	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
or	1
not,	1
will	1
undertake	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
the	1
measures	1
themselves.	1
They	1
will	1
consider	1
the	1
conformity	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
proposed	1
or	1
required	1
to	1
their	1
immediate	1
interests	1
or	1
aims;	1
the	1
momentary	1
conveniences	1
or	1
inconveniences	1
that	1
would	1
attend	1
its	1
adoption.	1
All	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
done;	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
interested	1
and	1
suspicious	1
scrutiny,	1
without	1
that	1
knowledge	1
of	1
national	1
circumstances	1
and	1
reasons	1
of	1
state,	1
which	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
a	1
right	1
judgment,	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
strong	1
predilection	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
local	1
objects,	1
which	1
can	1
hardly	1
fail	1
to	1
mislead	1
the	1
decision.	1
The	1
same	1
process	1
must	1
be	1
repeated	1
in	1
every	1
member	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
constituted;	1
and	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
plans,	1
framed	1
by	1
the	1
councils	1
of	1
the	1
whole,	1
will	1
always	1
fluctuate	1
on	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
the	1
ill-informed	1
and	1
prejudiced	1
opinion	1
of	1
every	1
part.	1
Those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
conversant	1
in	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
popular	1
assemblies;	1
who	1
have	1
seen	1
how	1
difficult	1
it	1
often	1
is,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
exterior	1
pressure	1
of	1
circumstances,	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
harmonious	1
resolutions	1
on	1
important	1
points,	1
will	1
readily	1
conceive	1
how	1
impossible	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
induce	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
such	1
assemblies,	1
deliberating	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
from	1
each	1
other,	1
at	1
different	1
times,	1
and	1
under	1
different	1
impressions,	1
long	1
to	1
co-operate	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
views	1
and	1
pursuits.	1
In	1
our	1
case,	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
thirteen	1
distinct	1
sovereign	1
wills	1
is	1
requisite,	1
under	1
the	1
Confederation,	1
to	1
the	1
complete	1
execution	1
of	1
every	1
important	1
measure	1
that	1
proceeds	1
from	1
the	1
Union.	1
It	1
has	1
happened	1
as	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
foreseen.	1
The	1
measures	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
executed;	1
the	1
delinquencies	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
have,	1
step	1
by	1
step,	1
matured	1
themselves	1
to	1
an	1
extreme,	1
which	1
has,	1
at	1
length,	1
arrested	1
all	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
and	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
an	1
awful	1
stand.	1
Congress	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
scarcely	1
possess	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
keeping	1
up	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
administration,	1
till	1
the	1
States	1
can	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
agree	1
upon	1
a	1
more	1
substantial	1
substitute	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
federal	1
government.	1
Things	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
desperate	1
extremity	1
at	1
once.	1
The	1
causes	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
specified	1
produced	1
at	1
first	1
only	1
unequal	1
and	1
disproportionate	1
degrees	1
of	1
compliance	1
with	1
the	1
requisitions	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
The	1
greater	1
deficiencies	1
of	1
some	1
States	1
furnished	1
the	1
pretext	1
of	1
example	1
and	1
the	1
temptation	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
the	1
complying,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
least	1
delinquent	1
States.	1
Why	1
should	1
we	1
do	1
more	1
in	1
proportion	1
than	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
embarked	1
with	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
political	1
voyage?	1
Why	1
should	1
we	1
consent	1
to	1
bear	1
more	1
than	1
our	1
proper	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
burden?	1
These	1
were	1
suggestions	1
which	1
human	1
selfishness	1
could	1
not	1
withstand,	1
and	1
which	1
even	1
speculative	1
men,	1
who	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
remote	1
consequences,	1
could	1
not,	1
without	1
hesitation,	1
combat.	1
Each	1
State,	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
persuasive	1
voice	1
of	1
immediate	1
interest	1
or	1
convenience,	1
has	1
successively	1
withdrawn	1
its	1
support,	1
till	1
the	1
frail	1
and	1
tottering	1
edifice	1
seems	1
ready	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
our	1
heads,	1
and	1
to	1
crush	1
us	1
beneath	1
its	1
ruins.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
tendency	1
of	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
legislation	1
for	1
States,	1
or	1
communities,	1
in	1
their	1
political	1
capacities,	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
exemplified	1
by	1
the	1
experiment	1
we	1
have	1
made	1
of	1
it,	1
is	1
equally	1
attested	1
by	1
the	1
events	1
which	1
have	1
befallen	1
all	1
other	1
governments	1
of	1
the	1
confederate	1
kind,	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
any	1
account,	1
in	1
exact	1
proportion	1
to	1
its	1
prevalence	1
in	1
those	1
systems.	1
The	1
confirmations	1
of	1
this	1
fact	1
will	1
be	1
worthy	1
of	1
a	1
distinct	1
and	1
particular	1
examination.	1
I	1
shall	1
content	1
myself	1
with	1
barely	1
observing	1
here,	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
confederacies	1
of	1
antiquity,	1
which	1
history	1
has	1
handed	1
down	1
to	1
us,	1
the	1
Lycian	1
and	1
Achaean	1
leagues,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
there	1
remain	1
vestiges	1
of	1
them,	1
appear	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
fetters	1
of	1
that	1
mistaken	1
principle,	1
and	1
were	1
accordingly	1
those	1
which	1
have	1
best	1
deserved,	1
and	1
have	1
most	1
liberally	1
received,	1
the	1
applauding	1
suffrages	1
of	1
political	1
writers.	1
This	1
exceptionable	1
principle	1
may,	1
as	1
truly	1
as	1
emphatically,	1
be	1
styled	1
the	1
parent	1
of	1
anarchy:	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
seen	1
that	1
delinquencies	1
in	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
are	1
its	1
natural	1
and	1
necessary	1
offspring;	1
and	1
that	1
whenever	1
they	1
happen,	1
the	1
only	1
constitutional	1
remedy	1
is	1
force,	1
and	1
the	1
immediate	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
it,	1
civil	1
war.	1
It	1
remains	1
to	1
inquire	1
how	1
far	1
so	1
odious	1
an	1
engine	1
of	1
government,	1
in	1
its	1
application	1
to	1
us,	1
would	1
even	1
be	1
capable	1
of	1
answering	1
its	1
end.	1
If	1
there	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
large	1
army	1
constantly	1
at	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
it	1
would	1
either	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
employ	1
force	1
at	1
all,	1
or,	1
when	1
this	1
could	1
be	1
done,	1
it	1
would	1
amount	1
to	1
a	1
war	1
between	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy	1
concerning	1
the	1
infractions	1
of	1
a	1
league,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
strongest	1
combination	1
would	1
be	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
prevail,	1
whether	1
it	1
consisted	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
supported	1
or	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
resisted	1
the	1
general	1
authority.	1
It	1
would	1
rarely	1
happen	1
that	1
the	1
delinquency	1
to	1
be	1
redressed	1
would	1
be	1
confined	1
to	1
a	1
single	1
member,	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
neglected	1
their	1
duty,	1
similarity	1
of	1
situation	1
would	1
induce	1
them	1
to	1
unite	1
for	1
common	1
defense.	1
Independent	1
of	1
this	1
motive	1
of	1
sympathy,	1
if	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
influential	1
State	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
aggressing	1
member,	1
it	1
would	1
commonly	1
have	1
weight	1
enough	1
with	1
its	1
neighbors	1
to	1
win	1
over	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
associates	1
to	1
its	1
cause.	1
Specious	1
arguments	1
of	1
danger	1
to	1
the	1
common	1
liberty	1
could	1
easily	1
be	1
contrived;	1
plausible	1
excuses	1
for	1
the	1
deficiencies	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
could,	1
without	1
difficulty,	1
be	1
invented	1
to	1
alarm	1
the	1
apprehensions,	1
inflame	1
the	1
passions,	1
and	1
conciliate	1
the	1
good-will,	1
even	1
of	1
those	1
States	1
which	1
were	1
not	1
chargeable	1
with	1
any	1
violation	1
or	1
omission	1
of	1
duty.	1
This	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
take	1
place,	1
as	1
the	1
delinquencies	1
of	1
the	1
larger	1
members	1
might	1
be	1
expected	1
sometimes	1
to	1
proceed	1
from	1
an	1
ambitious	1
premeditation	1
in	1
their	1
rulers,	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
getting	1
rid	1
of	1
all	1
external	1
control	1
upon	1
their	1
designs	1
of	1
personal	1
aggrandizement;	1
the	1
better	1
to	1
effect	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
presumable	1
they	1
would	1
tamper	1
beforehand	1
with	1
leading	1
individuals	1
in	1
the	1
adjacent	1
States.	1
If	1
associates	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
at	1
home,	1
recourse	1
would	1
be	1
had	1
to	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
foreign	1
powers,	1
who	1
would	1
seldom	1
be	1
disinclined	1
to	1
encouraging	1
the	1
dissensions	1
of	1
a	1
Confederacy,	1
from	1
the	1
firm	1
union	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
fear.	1
When	1
the	1
sword	1
is	1
once	1
drawn,	1
the	1
passions	1
of	1
men	1
observe	1
no	1
bounds	1
of	1
moderation.	1
The	1
suggestions	1
of	1
wounded	1
pride,	1
the	1
instigations	1
of	1
irritated	1
resentment,	1
would	1
be	1
apt	1
to	1
carry	1
the	1
States	1
against	1
which	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
were	1
exerted,	1
to	1
any	1
extremes	1
necessary	1
to	1
avenge	1
the	1
affront	1
or	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
disgrace	1
of	1
submission.	1
The	1
first	1
war	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
would	1
probably	1
terminate	1
in	1
a	1
dissolution	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
This	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
the	1
violent	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy.	1
Its	1
more	1
natural	1
death	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
now	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
experiencing,	1
if	1
the	1
federal	1
system	1
be	1
not	1
speedily	1
renovated	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
substantial	1
form.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
probable,	1
considering	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
this	1
country,	1
that	1
the	1
complying	1
States	1
would	1
often	1
be	1
inclined	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
by	1
engaging	1
in	1
a	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
non-complying	1
States.	1
They	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
more	1
ready	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
milder	1
course	1
of	1
putting	1
themselves	1
upon	1
an	1
equal	1
footing	1
with	1
the	1
delinquent	1
members	1
by	1
an	1
imitation	1
of	1
their	1
example.	1
And	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
all	1
would	1
thus	1
become	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
all.	1
Our	1
past	1
experience	1
has	1
exhibited	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
this	1
spirit	1
in	1
its	1
full	1
light.	1
There	1
would,	1
in	1
fact,	1
be	1
an	1
insuperable	1
difficulty	1
in	1
ascertaining	1
when	1
force	1
could	1
with	1
propriety	1
be	1
employed.	1
In	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
pecuniary	1
contribution,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
usual	1
source	1
of	1
delinquency,	1
it	1
would	1
often	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
decide	1
whether	1
it	1
had	1
proceeded	1
from	1
disinclination	1
or	1
inability.	1
The	1
pretense	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
at	1
hand.	1
And	1
the	1
case	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
flagrant	1
in	1
which	1
its	1
fallacy	1
could	1
be	1
detected	1
with	1
sufficient	1
certainty	1
to	1
justify	1
the	1
harsh	1
expedient	1
of	1
compulsion.	1
It	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
this	1
problem	1
alone,	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
occur,	1
would	1
open	1
a	1
wide	1
field	1
for	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
factious	1
views,	1
of	1
partiality,	1
and	1
of	1
oppression,	1
in	1
the	1
majority	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
prevail	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
council.	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
require	1
no	1
pains	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
States	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
prefer	1
a	1
national	1
Constitution	1
which	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
motion	1
by	1
the	1
instrumentality	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
army	1
continually	1
on	1
foot	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
ordinary	1
requisitions	1
or	1
decrees	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
And	1
yet	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
plain	1
alternative	1
involved	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
wish	1
to	1
deny	1
it	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
extending	1
its	1
operations	1
to	1
individuals.	1
Such	1
a	1
scheme,	1
if	1
practicable	1
at	1
all,	1
would	1
instantly	1
degenerate	1
into	1
a	1
military	1
despotism;	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
every	1
light	1
impracticable.	1
The	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
maintenance	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
considerable	1
enough	1
to	1
confine	1
the	1
larger	1
States	1
within	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
their	1
duty;	1
nor	1
would	1
the	1
means	1
ever	1
be	1
furnished	1
of	1
forming	1
such	1
an	1
army	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance.	1
Whoever	1
considers	1
the	1
populousness	1
and	1
strength	1
of	1
several	1
of	1
these	1
States	1
singly	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
juncture,	1
and	1
looks	1
forward	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
will	1
become,	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
century,	1
will	1
at	1
once	1
dismiss	1
as	1
idle	1
and	1
visionary	1
any	1
scheme	1
which	1
aims	1
at	1
regulating	1
their	1
movements	1
by	1
laws	1
to	1
operate	1
upon	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
collective	1
capacities,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
executed	1
by	1
a	1
coercion	1
applicable	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
capacities.	1
A	1
project	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
is	1
little	1
less	1
romantic	1
than	1
the	1
monster-taming	1
spirit	1
which	1
is	1
attributed	1
to	1
the	1
fabulous	1
heroes	1
and	1
demi-gods	1
of	1
antiquity.	1
Even	1
in	1
those	1
confederacies	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
composed	1
of	1
members	1
smaller	1
than	1
many	1
of	1
our	1
counties,	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
legislation	1
for	1
sovereign	1
States,	1
supported	1
by	1
military	1
coercion,	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
found	1
effectual.	1
It	1
has	1
rarely	1
been	1
attempted	1
to	1
be	1
employed,	1
but	1
against	1
the	1
weaker	1
members;	1
and	1
in	1
most	1
instances	1
attempts	1
to	1
coerce	1
the	1
refractory	1
and	1
disobedient	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
signals	1
of	1
bloody	1
wars,	1
in	1
which	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
confederacy	1
has	1
displayed	1
its	1
banners	1
against	1
the	1
other	1
half.	1
The	1
result	1
of	1
these	1
observations	1
to	1
an	1
intelligent	1
mind	1
must	1
be	1
clearly	1
this,	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
possible	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
to	1
construct	1
a	1
federal	1
government	1
capable	1
of	1
regulating	1
the	1
common	1
concerns	1
and	1
preserving	1
the	1
general	1
tranquillity,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
founded,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
objects	1
committed	1
to	1
its	1
care,	1
upon	1
the	1
reverse	1
of	1
the	1
principle	1
contended	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
opponents	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution.	1
It	1
must	1
carry	1
its	1
agency	1
to	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
the	1
citizens.	1
It	1
must	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
no	1
intermediate	1
legislations;	1
but	1
must	1
itself	1
be	1
empowered	1
to	1
employ	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
ordinary	1
magistrate	1
to	1
execute	1
its	1
own	1
resolutions.	1
The	1
majesty	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
authority	1
must	1
be	1
manifested	1
through	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
justice.	1
The	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
each	1
State,	1
must	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
address	1
itself	1
immediately	1
to	1
the	1
hopes	1
and	1
fears	1
of	1
individuals;	1
and	1
to	1
attract	1
to	1
its	1
support	1
those	1
passions	1
which	1
have	1
the	1
strongest	1
influence	1
upon	1
the	1
human	1
heart.	1
It	1
must,	1
in	1
short,	1
possess	1
all	1
the	1
means,	1
and	1
have	1
aright	1
to	1
resort	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
methods,	1
of	1
executing	1
the	1
powers	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
intrusted,	1
that	1
are	1
possessed	1
and	1
exercised	1
by	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
States.	1
To	1
this	1
reasoning	1
it	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
objected,	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
State	1
should	1
be	1
disaffected	1
to	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
it	1
could	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
obstruct	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
its	1
laws,	1
and	1
bring	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
issue	1
of	1
force,	1
with	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
opposite	1
scheme	1
is	1
reproached.	1
The	1
plausibility	1
of	1
this	1
objection	1
will	1
vanish	1
the	1
moment	1
we	1
advert	1
to	1
the	1
essential	1
difference	1
between	1
a	1
mere	1
NON-COMPLIANCE	1
and	1
a	1
DIRECT	1
and	1
ACTIVE	1
RESISTANCE.	1
If	1
the	1
interposition	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
give	1
effect	1
to	1
a	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
they	1
have	1
only	1
NOT	1
TO	1
ACT,	1
or	1
to	1
ACT	1
EVASIVELY,	1
and	1
the	1
measure	1
is	1
defeated.	1
This	1
neglect	1
of	1
duty	1
may	1
be	1
disguised	1
under	1
affected	1
but	1
unsubstantial	1
provisions,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
appear,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
not	1
to	1
excite	1
any	1
alarm	1
in	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
The	1
State	1
leaders	1
may	1
even	1
make	1
a	1
merit	1
of	1
their	1
surreptitious	1
invasions	1
of	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
some	1
temporary	1
convenience,	1
exemption,	1
or	1
advantage.	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
should	1
not	1
require	1
the	1
intervention	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
pass	1
into	1
immediate	1
operation	1
upon	1
the	1
citizens	1
themselves,	1
the	1
particular	1
governments	1
could	1
not	1
interrupt	1
their	1
progress	1
without	1
an	1
open	1
and	1
violent	1
exertion	1
of	1
an	1
unconstitutional	1
power.	1
No	1
omissions	1
nor	1
evasions	1
would	1
answer	1
the	1
end.	1
They	1
would	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
act,	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
would	1
leave	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
encroached	1
on	1
the	1
national	1
rights.	1
An	1
experiment	1
of	1
this	1
nature	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
hazardous	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
constitution	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
competent	1
to	1
its	1
own	1
defense,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
people	1
enlightened	1
enough	1
to	1
distinguish	1
between	1
a	1
legal	1
exercise	1
and	1
an	1
illegal	1
usurpation	1
of	1
authority.	1
The	1
success	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
require	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
factious	1
majority	1
in	1
the	1
legislature,	1
but	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
justice	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
If	1
the	1
judges	1
were	1
not	1
embarked	1
in	1
a	1
conspiracy	1
with	1
the	1
legislature,	1
they	1
would	1
pronounce	1
the	1
resolutions	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
majority	1
to	1
be	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
supreme	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
unconstitutional,	1
and	1
void.	1
If	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
not	1
tainted	1
with	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
their	1
State	1
representatives,	1
they,	1
as	1
the	1
natural	1
guardians	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
would	1
throw	1
their	1
weight	1
into	1
the	1
national	1
scale	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
a	1
decided	1
preponderancy	1
in	1
the	1
contest.	1
Attempts	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
would	1
not	1
often	1
be	1
made	1
with	1
levity	1
or	1
rashness,	1
because	1
they	1
could	1
seldom	1
be	1
made	1
without	1
danger	1
to	1
the	1
authors,	1
unless	1
in	1
cases	1
of	1
a	1
tyrannical	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
authority.	1
If	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
should	1
arise	1
from	1
the	1
disorderly	1
conduct	1
of	1
refractory	1
or	1
seditious	1
individuals,	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
overcome	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
means	1
which	1
are	1
daily	1
employed	1
against	1
the	1
same	1
evil	1
under	1
the	1
State	1
governments.	1
The	1
magistracy,	1
being	1
equally	1
the	1
ministers	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
from	1
whatever	1
source	1
it	1
might	1
emanate,	1
would	1
doubtless	1
be	1
as	1
ready	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
national	1
as	1
the	1
local	1
regulations	1
from	1
the	1
inroads	1
of	1
private	1
licentiousness.	1
As	1
to	1
those	1
partial	1
commotions	1
and	1
insurrections,	1
which	1
sometimes	1
disquiet	1
society,	1
from	1
the	1
intrigues	1
of	1
an	1
inconsiderable	1
faction,	1
or	1
from	1
sudden	1
or	1
occasional	1
illhumors	1
that	1
do	1
not	1
infect	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
could	1
command	1
more	1
extensive	1
resources	1
for	1
the	1
suppression	1
of	1
disturbances	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
than	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
any	1
single	1
member.	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
those	1
mortal	1
feuds	1
which,	1
in	1
certain	1
conjunctures,	1
spread	1
a	1
conflagration	1
through	1
a	1
whole	1
nation,	1
or	1
through	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
proportion	1
of	1
it,	1
proceeding	1
either	1
from	1
weighty	1
causes	1
of	1
discontent	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
government	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
contagion	1
of	1
some	1
violent	1
popular	1
paroxysm,	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
fall	1
within	1
any	1
ordinary	1
rules	1
of	1
calculation.	1
When	1
they	1
happen,	1
they	1
commonly	1
amount	1
to	1
revolutions	1
and	1
dismemberments	1
of	1
empire.	1
No	1
form	1
of	1
government	1
can	1
always	1
either	1
avoid	1
or	1
control	1
them.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
hope	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
events	1
too	1
mighty	1
for	1
human	1
foresight	1
or	1
precaution,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
idle	1
to	1
object	1
to	1
a	1

because	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
perform	1
impossibilities.	1

AN	1
OBJECTION,	1
of	1
a	1
nature	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
stated	1
and	1
answered,	1
in	1
my	1
last	1
address,	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
likewise	1
urged	1
against	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
legislation	1
for	1
the	1
individual	1
citizens	1
of	1
America.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
tend	1
to	1
render	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
too	1
powerful,	1
and	1
to	1
enable	1
it	1
to	1
absorb	1
those	1
residuary	1
authorities,	1
which	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
judged	1
proper	1
to	1
leave	1
with	1
the	1
States	1
for	1
local	1
purposes.	1
Allowing	1
the	1
utmost	1
latitude	1
to	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
power	1
which	1
any	1
reasonable	1
man	1
can	1
require,	1
I	1
confess	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
discover	1
what	1
temptation	1
the	1
persons	1
intrusted	1
with	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
could	1
ever	1
feel	1
to	1
divest	1
the	1
States	1
of	1
the	1
authorities	1
of	1
that	1
description.	1
The	1
regulation	1
of	1
the	1
mere	1
domestic	1
police	1
of	1
a	1
State	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
hold	1
out	1
slender	1
allurements	1
to	1
ambition.	1
Commerce,	1
finance,	1
negotiation,	1
and	1
war	1
seem	1
to	1
comprehend	1
all	1
the	1
objects	1
which	1
have	1
charms	1
for	1
minds	1
governed	1
by	1
that	1
passion;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
necessary	1
to	1
those	1
objects	1
ought,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance,	1
to	1
be	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
depository.	1
The	1
administration	1
of	1
private	1
justice	1
between	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
State,	1
the	1
supervision	1
of	1
agriculture	1
and	1
of	1
other	1
concerns	1
of	1
a	1
similar	1
nature,	1
all	1
those	1
things,	1
in	1
short,	1
which	1
are	1
proper	1
to	1
be	1
provided	1
for	1
by	1
local	1
legislation,	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
desirable	1
cares	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
jurisdiction.	1
It	1
is	1
therefore	1
improbable	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
exist	1
a	1
disposition	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
councils	1
to	1
usurp	1
the	1
powers	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
connected;	1
because	1
the	1
attempt	1
to	1
exercise	1
those	1
powers	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
troublesome	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
nugatory;	1
and	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
them,	1
for	1
that	1
reason,	1
would	1
contribute	1
nothing	1
to	1
the	1
dignity,	1
to	1
the	1
importance,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
splendor	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government.	1
But	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
admitted,	1
for	1
argument's	1
sake,	1
that	1
mere	1
wantonness	1
and	1
lust	1
of	1
domination	1
would	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
beget	1
that	1
disposition;	1
still	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
safely	1
affirmed,	1
that	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
constituent	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
representatives,	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
would	1
control	1
the	1
indulgence	1
of	1
so	1
extravagant	1
an	1
appetite.	1
It	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
far	1
more	1
easy	1
for	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
to	1
encroach	1
upon	1
the	1
national	1
authorities	1
than	1
for	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
to	1
encroach	1
upon	1
the	1
State	1
authorities.	1
The	1
proof	1
of	1
this	1
proposition	1
turns	1
upon	1
the	1
greater	1
degree	1
of	1
influence	1
which	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
if	1
they	1
administer	1
their	1
affairs	1
with	1
uprightness	1
and	1
prudence,	1
will	1
generally	1
possess	1
over	1
the	1
people;	1
a	1
circumstance	1
which	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
teaches	1
us	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
inherent	1
and	1
intrinsic	1
weakness	1
in	1
all	1
federal	1
constitutions;	1
and	1
that	1
too	1
much	1
pains	1
cannot	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
their	1
organization,	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
force	1
which	1
is	1
compatible	1
with	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
liberty.	1
The	1
superiority	1
of	1
influence	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
governments	1
would	1
result	1
partly	1
from	1
the	1
diffusive	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
but	1
chiefly	1
from	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
objects	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
administrations	1
would	1
be	1
directed.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
known	1
fact	1
in	1
human	1
nature,	1
that	1
its	1
affections	1
are	1
commonly	1
weak	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
distance	1
or	1
diffusiveness	1
of	1
the	1
object.	1
Upon	1
the	1
same	1
principle	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
more	1
attached	1
to	1
his	1
family	1
than	1
to	1
his	1
neighborhood,	1
to	1
his	1
neighborhood	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
community	1
at	1
large,	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
each	1
State	1
would	1
be	1
apt	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
stronger	1
bias	1
towards	1
their	1
local	1
governments	1
than	1
towards	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
Union;	1
unless	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
that	1
principle	1
should	1
be	1
destroyed	1
by	1
a	1
much	1
better	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
latter.	1
This	1
strong	1
propensity	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
heart	1
would	1
find	1
powerful	1
auxiliaries	1
in	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
State	1
regulation.	1
The	1
variety	1
of	1
more	1
minute	1
interests,	1
which	1
will	1
necessarily	1
fall	1
under	1
the	1
superintendence	1
of	1
the	1
local	1
administrations,	1
and	1
which	1
will	1
form	1
so	1
many	1
rivulets	1
of	1
influence,	1
running	1
through	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
society,	1
cannot	1
be	1
particularized,	1
without	1
involving	1
a	1
detail	1
too	1
tedious	1
and	1
uninteresting	1
to	1
compensate	1
for	1
the	1
instruction	1
it	1
might	1
afford.	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
transcendant	1
advantage	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
which	1
alone	1
suffices	1
to	1
place	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
a	1
clear	1
and	1
satisfactory	1
light,--I	1
mean	1
the	1
ordinary	1
administration	1
of	1
criminal	1
and	1
civil	1
justice.	1
This,	1
of	1
all	1
others,	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
powerful,	1
most	1
universal,	1
and	1
most	1
attractive	1
source	1
of	1
popular	1
obedience	1
and	1
attachment.	1
It	1
is	1
that	1
which,	1
being	1
the	1
immediate	1
and	1
visible	1
guardian	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
property,	1
having	1
its	1
benefits	1
and	1
its	1
terrors	1
in	1
constant	1
activity	1
before	1
the	1
public	1
eye,	1
regulating	1
all	1
those	1
personal	1
interests	1
and	1
familiar	1
concerns	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
sensibility	1
of	1
individuals	1
is	1
more	1
immediately	1
awake,	1
contributes,	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
circumstance,	1
to	1
impressing	1
upon	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
affection,	1
esteem,	1
and	1
reverence	1
towards	1
the	1
government.	1
This	1
great	1
cement	1
of	1
society,	1
which	1
will	1
diffuse	1
itself	1
almost	1
wholly	1
through	1
the	1
channels	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
governments,	1
independent	1
of	1
all	1
other	1
causes	1
of	1
influence,	1
would	1
insure	1
them	1
so	1
decided	1
an	1
empire	1
over	1
their	1
respective	1
citizens	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
them	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
a	1
complete	1
counterpoise,	1
and,	1
not	1
unfrequently,	1
dangerous	1
rivals	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
The	1
operations	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
falling	1
less	1
immediately	1
under	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
citizens,	1
the	1
benefits	1
derived	1
from	1
it	1
will	1
chiefly	1
be	1
perceived	1
and	1
attended	1
to	1
by	1
speculative	1
men.	1
Relating	1
to	1
more	1
general	1
interests,	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
less	1
apt	1
to	1
come	1
home	1
to	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
and,	1
in	1
proportion,	1
less	1
likely	1
to	1
inspire	1
an	1
habitual	1
sense	1
of	1
obligation,	1
and	1
an	1
active	1
sentiment	1
of	1
attachment.	1
The	1
reasoning	1
on	1
this	1
head	1
has	1
been	1
abundantly	1
exemplified	1
by	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
all	1
federal	1
constitutions	1
with	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
acquainted,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
others	1
which	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
least	1
analogy	1
to	1
them.	1
Though	1
the	1
ancient	1
feudal	1
systems	1
were	1
not,	1
strictly	1
speaking,	1
confederacies,	1
yet	1
they	1
partook	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
that	1
species	1
of	1
association.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
common	1
head,	1
chieftain,	1
or	1
sovereign,	1
whose	1
authority	1
extended	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
nation;	1
and	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
subordinate	1
vassals,	1
or	1
feudatories,	1
who	1
had	1
large	1
portions	1
of	1
land	1
allotted	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
numerous	1
trains	1
of	1
INFERIOR	1
vassals	1
or	1
retainers,	1
who	1
occupied	1
and	1
cultivated	1
that	1
land	1
upon	1
the	1
tenure	1
of	1
fealty	1
or	1
obedience,	1
to	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
held	1
it.	1
Each	1
principal	1
vassal	1
was	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
sovereign,	1
within	1
his	1
particular	1
demesnes.	1
The	1
consequences	1
of	1
this	1
situation	1
were	1
a	1
continual	1
opposition	1
to	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
sovereign,	1
and	1
frequent	1
wars	1
between	1
the	1
great	1
barons	1
or	1
chief	1
feudatories	1
themselves.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
was	1
commonly	1
too	1
weak,	1
either	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
public	1
peace,	1
or	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
people	1
against	1
the	1
oppressions	1
of	1
their	1
immediate	1
lords.	1
This	1
period	1
of	1
European	1
affairs	1
is	1
emphatically	1
styled	1
by	1
historians,	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
feudal	1
anarchy.	1
When	1
the	1
sovereign	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
vigorous	1
and	1
warlike	1
temper	1
and	1
of	1
superior	1
abilities,	1
he	1
would	1
acquire	1
a	1
personal	1
weight	1
and	1
influence,	1
which	1
answered,	1
for	1
the	1
time,	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
regular	1
authority.	1
But	1
in	1
general,	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
barons	1
triumphed	1
over	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
prince;	1
and	1
in	1
many	1
instances	1
his	1
dominion	1
was	1
entirely	1
thrown	1
off,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
fiefs	1
were	1
erected	1
into	1
independent	1
principalities	1
or	1
States.	1
In	1
those	1
instances	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
monarch	1
finally	1
prevailed	1
over	1
his	1
vassals,	1
his	1
success	1
was	1
chiefly	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
tyranny	1
of	1
those	1
vassals	1
over	1
their	1
dependents.	1
The	1
barons,	1
or	1
nobles,	1
equally	1
the	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
sovereign	1
and	1
the	1
oppressors	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
people,	1
were	1
dreaded	1
and	1
detested	1
by	1
both;	1
till	1
mutual	1
danger	1
and	1
mutual	1
interest	1
effected	1
a	1
union	1
between	1
them	1
fatal	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
aristocracy.	1
Had	1
the	1
nobles,	1
by	1
a	1
conduct	1
of	1
clemency	1
and	1
justice,	1
preserved	1
the	1
fidelity	1
and	1
devotion	1
of	1
their	1
retainers	1
and	1
followers,	1
the	1
contests	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
prince	1
must	1
almost	1
always	1
have	1
ended	1
in	1
their	1
favor,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
abridgment	1
or	1
subversion	1
of	1
the	1
royal	1
authority.	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
assertion	1
founded	1
merely	1
in	1
speculation	1
or	1
conjecture.	1
Among	1
other	1
illustrations	1
of	1
its	1
truth	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
cited,	1
Scotland	1
will	1
furnish	1
a	1
cogent	1
example.	1
The	1
spirit	1
of	1
clanship	1
which	1
was,	1
at	1
an	1
early	1
day,	1
introduced	1
into	1
that	1
kingdom,	1
uniting	1
the	1
nobles	1
and	1
their	1
dependants	1
by	1
ties	1
equivalent	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
kindred,	1
rendered	1
the	1
aristocracy	1
a	1
constant	1
overmatch	1
for	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
monarch,	1
till	1
the	1
incorporation	1
with	1
England	1
subdued	1
its	1
fierce	1
and	1
ungovernable	1
spirit,	1
and	1
reduced	1
it	1
within	1
those	1
rules	1
of	1
subordination	1
which	1
a	1
more	1
rational	1
and	1
more	1
energetic	1
system	1
of	1
civil	1
polity	1
had	1
previously	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
kingdom.	1
The	1
separate	1
governments	1
in	1
a	1
confederacy	1
may	1
aptly	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
feudal	1
baronies;	1
with	1
this	1
advantage	1
in	1
their	1
favor,	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
reasons	1
already	1
explained,	1
they	1
will	1
generally	1
possess	1
the	1
confidence	1
and	1
good-will	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
with	1
so	1
important	1
a	1
support,	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
effectually	1
to	1
oppose	1
all	1
encroachments	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
counteract	1
its	1
legitimate	1
and	1
necessary	1
authority.	1
The	1
points	1
of	1
similitude	1
consist	1
in	1
the	1
rivalship	1
of	1
power,	1
applicable	1
to	1
both,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
CONCENTRATION	1
of	1
large	1
portions	1
of	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
into	1
particular	1
DEPOSITS,	1
in	1
one	1
case	1
at	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
individuals,	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
case	1
at	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
political	1
bodies.	1
A	1
concise	1
review	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
that	1
have	1
attended	1
confederate	1
governments	1
will	1
further	1
illustrate	1
this	1
important	1
doctrine;	1
an	1
inattention	1
to	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
great	1
source	1
of	1
our	1
political	1
mistakes,	1
and	1
has	1
given	1
our	1
jealousy	1
a	1
direction	1
to	1
the	1
wrong	1
side.	1
This	1

HAMILTON	1

MADISON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
AMONG	1
the	1
confederacies	1
of	1
antiquity,	1
the	1
most	1
considerable	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Grecian	1
republics,	1
associated	1
under	1
the	1
Amphictyonic	1
council.	1
From	1
the	1
best	1
accounts	1
transmitted	1
of	1
this	1
celebrated	1
institution,	1
it	1
bore	1
a	1
very	1
instructive	1
analogy	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
Confederation	1
of	1
the	1
American	1
States.	1
The	1
members	1
retained	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
independent	1
and	1
sovereign	1
states,	1
and	1
had	1
equal	1
votes	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
council.	1
This	1
council	1
had	1
a	1
general	1
authority	1
to	1
propose	1
and	1
resolve	1
whatever	1
it	1
judged	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
welfare	1
of	1
Greece;	1
to	1
declare	1
and	1
carry	1
on	1
war;	1
to	1
decide,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
resort,	1
all	1
controversies	1
between	1
the	1
members;	1
to	1
fine	1
the	1
aggressing	1
party;	1
to	1
employ	1
the	1
whole	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
confederacy	1
against	1
the	1
disobedient;	1
to	1
admit	1
new	1
members.	1
The	1
Amphictyons	1
were	1
the	1
guardians	1
of	1
religion,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
immense	1
riches	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
Delphos,	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
jurisdiction	1
in	1
controversies	1
between	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
consult	1
the	1
oracle.	1
As	1
a	1
further	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
powers,	1
they	1
took	1
an	1
oath	1
mutually	1
to	1
defend	1
and	1
protect	1
the	1
united	1
cities,	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
violators	1
of	1
this	1
oath,	1
and	1
to	1
inflict	1
vengeance	1
on	1
sacrilegious	1
despoilers	1
of	1
the	1
temple.	1
In	1
theory,	1
and	1
upon	1
paper,	1
this	1
apparatus	1
of	1
powers	1
seems	1
amply	1
sufficient	1
for	1
all	1
general	1
purposes.	1
In	1
several	1
material	1
instances,	1
they	1
exceed	1
the	1
powers	1
enumerated	1
in	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
confederation.	1
The	1
Amphictyons	1
had	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
the	1
superstition	1
of	1
the	1
times,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
engines	1
by	1
which	1
government	1
was	1
then	1
maintained;	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
declared	1
authority	1
to	1
use	1
coercion	1
against	1
refractory	1
cities,	1
and	1
were	1
bound	1
by	1
oath	1
to	1
exert	1
this	1
authority	1
on	1
the	1
necessary	1
occasions.	1
Very	1
different,	1
nevertheless,	1
was	1
the	1
experiment	1
from	1
the	1
theory.	1
The	1
powers,	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
Congress,	1
were	1
administered	1
by	1
deputies	1
appointed	1
wholly	1
by	1
the	1
cities	1
in	1
their	1
political	1
capacities;	1
and	1
exercised	1
over	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
capacities.	1
Hence	1
the	1
weakness,	1
the	1
disorders,	1
and	1
finally	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
confederacy.	1
The	1
more	1
powerful	1
members,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
kept	1
in	1
awe	1
and	1
subordination,	1
tyrannized	1
successively	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
Athens,	1
as	1
we	1
learn	1
from	1
Demosthenes,	1
was	1
the	1
arbiter	1
of	1
Greece	1
seventy-three	1
years.	1
The	1
Lacedaemonians	1
next	1
governed	1
it	1
twenty-nine	1
years;	1
at	1
a	1
subsequent	1
period,	1
after	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Leuctra,	1
the	1
Thebans	1
had	1
their	1
turn	1
of	1
domination.	1
It	1
happened	1
but	1
too	1
often,	1
according	1
to	1
Plutarch,	1
that	1
the	1
deputies	1
of	1
the	1
strongest	1
cities	1
awed	1
and	1
corrupted	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
weaker;	1
and	1
that	1
judgment	1
went	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
party.	1
Even	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
defensive	1
and	1
dangerous	1
wars	1
with	1
Persia	1
and	1
Macedon,	1
the	1
members	1
never	1
acted	1
in	1
concert,	1
and	1
were,	1
more	1
or	1
fewer	1
of	1
them,	1
eternally	1
the	1
dupes	1
or	1
the	1
hirelings	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
enemy.	1
The	1
intervals	1
of	1
foreign	1
war	1
were	1
filled	1
up	1
by	1
domestic	1
vicissitudes	1
convulsions,	1
and	1
carnage.	1
After	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
with	1
Xerxes,	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
the	1
Lacedaemonians	1
required	1
that	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
should	1
be	1
turned	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
confederacy	1
for	1
the	1
unfaithful	1
part	1
they	1
had	1
acted.	1
The	1
Athenians,	1
finding	1
that	1
the	1
Lacedaemonians	1
would	1
lose	1
fewer	1
partisans	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
measure	1
than	1
themselves,	1
and	1
would	1
become	1
masters	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
deliberations,	1
vigorously	1
opposed	1
and	1
defeated	1
the	1
attempt.	1
This	1
piece	1
of	1
history	1
proves	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
inefficiency	1
of	1
the	1
union,	1
the	1
ambition	1
and	1
jealousy	1
of	1
its	1
most	1
powerful	1
members,	1
and	1
the	1
dependent	1
and	1
degraded	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
rest.	1
The	1
smaller	1
members,	1
though	1
entitled	1
by	1
the	1
theory	1
of	1
their	1
system	1
to	1
revolve	1
in	1
equal	1
pride	1
and	1
majesty	1
around	1
the	1
common	1
center,	1
had	1
become,	1
in	1
fact,	1
satellites	1
of	1
the	1
orbs	1
of	1
primary	1
magnitude.	1
Had	1
the	1
Greeks,	1
says	1
the	1
Abbe	1
Milot,	1
been	1
as	1
wise	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
courageous,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
admonished	1
by	1
experience	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
closer	1
union,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
availed	1
themselves	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
which	1
followed	1
their	1
success	1
against	1
the	1
Persian	1
arms,	1
to	1
establish	1
such	1
a	1
reformation.	1
Instead	1
of	1
this	1
obvious	1
policy,	1
Athens	1
and	1
Sparta,	1
inflated	1
with	1
the	1
victories	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
they	1
had	1
acquired,	1
became	1
first	1
rivals	1
and	1
then	1
enemies;	1
and	1
did	1
each	1
other	1
infinitely	1
more	1
mischief	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
suffered	1
from	1
Xerxes.	1
Their	1
mutual	1
jealousies,	1
fears,	1
hatreds,	1
and	1
injuries	1
ended	1
in	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Peloponnesian	1
war;	1
which	1
itself	1
ended	1
in	1
the	1
ruin	1
and	1
slavery	1
of	1
the	1
Athenians	1
who	1
had	1
begun	1
it.	1
As	1
a	1
weak	1
government,	1
when	1
not	1
at	1
war,	1
is	1
ever	1
agitated	1
by	1
internal	1
dissentions,	1
so	1
these	1
never	1
fail	1
to	1
bring	1
on	1
fresh	1
calamities	1
from	1
abroad.	1
The	1
Phocians	1
having	1
ploughed	1
up	1
some	1
consecrated	1
ground	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
Apollo,	1
the	1
Amphictyonic	1
council,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
superstition	1
of	1
the	1
age,	1
imposed	1
a	1
fine	1
on	1
the	1
sacrilegious	1
offenders.	1
The	1
Phocians,	1
being	1
abetted	1
by	1
Athens	1
and	1
Sparta,	1
refused	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
the	1
decree.	1
The	1
Thebans,	1
with	1
others	1
of	1
the	1
cities,	1
undertook	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Amphictyons,	1
and	1
to	1
avenge	1
the	1
violated	1
god.	1
The	1
latter,	1
being	1
the	1
weaker	1
party,	1
invited	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
Philip	1
of	1
Macedon,	1
who	1
had	1
secretly	1
fostered	1
the	1
contest.	1
Philip	1
gladly	1
seized	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
executing	1
the	1
designs	1
he	1
had	1
long	1
planned	1
against	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
Greece.	1
By	1
his	1
intrigues	1
and	1
bribes	1
he	1
won	1
over	1
to	1
his	1
interests	1
the	1
popular	1
leaders	1
of	1
several	1
cities;	1
by	1
their	1
influence	1
and	1
votes,	1
gained	1
admission	1
into	1
the	1
Amphictyonic	1
council;	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
arts	1
and	1
his	1
arms,	1
made	1
himself	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
confederacy.	1
Such	1
were	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
the	1
fallacious	1
principle	1
on	1
which	1
this	1
interesting	1
establishment	1
was	1
founded.	1
Had	1
Greece,	1
says	1
a	1
judicious	1
observer	1
on	1
her	1
fate,	1
been	1
united	1
by	1
a	1
stricter	1
confederation,	1
and	1
persevered	1
in	1
her	1
union,	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
worn	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
Macedon;	1
and	1
might	1
have	1
proved	1
a	1
barrier	1
to	1
the	1
vast	1
projects	1
of	1
Rome.	1
The	1
Achaean	1
league,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
called,	1
was	1
another	1
society	1
of	1
Grecian	1
republics,	1
which	1
supplies	1
us	1
with	1
valuable	1
instruction.	1
The	1
Union	1
here	1
was	1
far	1
more	1
intimate,	1
and	1
its	1
organization	1
much	1
wiser,	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
preceding	1
instance.	1
It	1
will	1
accordingly	1
appear,	1
that	1
though	1
not	1
exempt	1
from	1
a	1
similar	1
catastrophe,	1
it	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
equally	1
deserved	1
it.	1
The	1
cities	1
composing	1
this	1
league	1
retained	1
their	1
municipal	1
jurisdiction,	1
appointed	1
their	1
own	1
officers,	1
and	1
enjoyed	1
a	1
perfect	1
equality.	1
The	1
senate,	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
represented,	1
had	1
the	1
sole	1
and	1
exclusive	1
right	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
war;	1
of	1
sending	1
and	1
receiving	1
ambassadors;	1
of	1
entering	1
into	1
treaties	1
and	1
alliances;	1
of	1
appointing	1
a	1
chief	1
magistrate	1
or	1
praetor,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
called,	1
who	1
commanded	1
their	1
armies,	1
and	1
who,	1
with	1
the	1
advice	1
and	1
consent	1
of	1
ten	1
of	1
the	1
senators,	1
not	1
only	1
administered	1
the	1
government	1
in	1
the	1
recess	1
of	1
the	1
senate,	1
but	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
share	1
in	1
its	1
deliberations,	1
when	1
assembled.	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
primitive	1
constitution,	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
praetors	1
associated	1
in	1
the	1
administration;	1
but	1
on	1
trial	1
a	1
single	1
one	1
was	1
preferred.	1
It	1
appears	1
that	1
the	1
cities	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
laws	1
and	1
customs,	1
the	1
same	1
weights	1
and	1
measures,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
money.	1
But	1
how	1
far	1
this	1
effect	1
proceeded	1
from	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
council	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
uncertainty.	1
It	1
is	1
said	1
only	1
that	1
the	1
cities	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
compelled	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
same	1
laws	1
and	1
usages.	1
When	1
Lacedaemon	1
was	1
brought	1
into	1
the	1
league	1
by	1
Philopoemen,	1
it	1
was	1
attended	1
with	1
an	1
abolition	1
of	1
the	1
institutions	1
and	1
laws	1
of	1
Lycurgus,	1
and	1
an	1
adoption	1
of	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Achaeans.	1
The	1
Amphictyonic	1
confederacy,	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
member,	1
left	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
exercise	1
of	1
her	1
government	1
and	1
her	1
legislation.	1
This	1
circumstance	1
alone	1
proves	1
a	1
very	1
material	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
systems.	1
It	1
is	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
regretted	1
that	1
such	1
imperfect	1
monuments	1
remain	1
of	1
this	1
curious	1
political	1
fabric.	1
Could	1
its	1
interior	1
structure	1
and	1
regular	1
operation	1
be	1
ascertained,	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
more	1
light	1
would	1
be	1
thrown	1
by	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
federal	1
government,	1
than	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
like	1
experiments	1
with	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
acquainted.	1
One	1
important	1
fact	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
witnessed	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
historians	1
who	1
take	1
notice	1
of	1
Achaean	1
affairs.	1
It	1
is,	1
that	1
as	1
well	1
after	1
the	1
renovation	1
of	1
the	1
league	1
by	1
Aratus,	1
as	1
before	1
its	1
dissolution	1
by	1
the	1
arts	1
of	1
Macedon,	1
there	1
was	1
infinitely	1
more	1
of	1
moderation	1
and	1
justice	1
in	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
its	1
government,	1
and	1
less	1
of	1
violence	1
and	1
sedition	1
in	1
the	1
people,	1
than	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
exercising	1
SINGLY	1
all	1
the	1
prerogatives	1
of	1
sovereignty.	1
The	1
Abbe	1
Mably,	1
in	1
his	1
observations	1
on	1
Greece,	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
popular	1
government,	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
tempestuous	1
elsewhere,	1
caused	1
no	1
disorders	1
in	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Achaean	1
republic,	1
BECAUSE	1
IT	1
WAS	1
THERE	1
TEMPERED	1
BY	1
THE	1
GENERAL	1
AUTHORITY	1
AND	1
LAWS	1
OF	1
THE	1
CONFEDERACY.	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
conclude	1
too	1
hastily,	1
however,	1
that	1
faction	1
did	1
not,	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
degree,	1
agitate	1
the	1
particular	1
cities;	1
much	1
less	1
that	1
a	1
due	1
subordination	1
and	1
harmony	1
reigned	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
system.	1
The	1
contrary	1
is	1
sufficiently	1
displayed	1
in	1
the	1
vicissitudes	1
and	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
republic.	1
Whilst	1
the	1
Amphictyonic	1
confederacy	1
remained,	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Achaeans,	1
which	1
comprehended	1
the	1
less	1
important	1
cities	1
only,	1
made	1
little	1
figure	1
on	1
the	1
theatre	1
of	1
Greece.	1
When	1
the	1
former	1
became	1
a	1
victim	1
to	1
Macedon,	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
spared	1
by	1
the	1
policy	1
of	1
Philip	1
and	1
Alexander.	1
Under	1
the	1
successors	1
of	1
these	1
princes,	1
however,	1
a	1
different	1
policy	1
prevailed.	1
The	1
arts	1
of	1
division	1
were	1
practiced	1
among	1
the	1
Achaeans.	1
Each	1
city	1
was	1
seduced	1
into	1
a	1
separate	1
interest;	1
the	1
union	1
was	1
dissolved.	1
Some	1
of	1
the	1
cities	1
fell	1
under	1
the	1
tyranny	1
of	1
Macedonian	1
garrisons;	1
others	1
under	1
that	1
of	1
usurpers	1
springing	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
confusions.	1
Shame	1
and	1
oppression	1
erelong	1
awaken	1
their	1
love	1
of	1
liberty.	1
A	1
few	1
cities	1
reunited.	1
Their	1
example	1
was	1
followed	1
by	1
others,	1
as	1
opportunities	1
were	1
found	1
of	1
cutting	1
off	1
their	1
tyrants.	1
The	1
league	1
soon	1
embraced	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
Peloponnesus.	1
Macedon	1
saw	1
its	1
progress;	1
but	1
was	1
hindered	1
by	1
internal	1
dissensions	1
from	1
stopping	1
it.	1
All	1
Greece	1
caught	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
and	1
seemed	1
ready	1
to	1
unite	1
in	1
one	1
confederacy,	1
when	1
the	1
jealousy	1
and	1
envy	1
in	1
Sparta	1
and	1
Athens,	1
of	1
the	1
rising	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
Achaeans,	1
threw	1
a	1
fatal	1
damp	1
on	1
the	1
enterprise.	1
The	1
dread	1
of	1
the	1
Macedonian	1
power	1
induced	1
the	1
league	1
to	1
court	1
the	1
alliance	1
of	1
the	1
Kings	1
of	1
Egypt	1
and	1
Syria,	1
who,	1
as	1
successors	1
of	1
Alexander,	1
were	1
rivals	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Macedon.	1
This	1
policy	1
was	1
defeated	1
by	1
Cleomenes,	1
king	1
of	1
Sparta,	1
who	1
was	1
led	1
by	1
his	1
ambition	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
unprovoked	1
attack	1
on	1
his	1
neighbors,	1
the	1
Achaeans,	1
and	1
who,	1
as	1
an	1
enemy	1
to	1
Macedon,	1
had	1
interest	1
enough	1
with	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
and	1
Syrian	1
princes	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
breach	1
of	1
their	1
engagements	1
with	1
the	1
league.	1
The	1
Achaeans	1
were	1
now	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
dilemma	1
of	1
submitting	1
to	1
Cleomenes,	1
or	1
of	1
supplicating	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
Macedon,	1
its	1
former	1
oppressor.	1
The	1
latter	1
expedient	1
was	1
adopted.	1
The	1
contests	1
of	1
the	1
Greeks	1
always	1
afforded	1
a	1
pleasing	1
opportunity	1
to	1
that	1
powerful	1
neighbor	1
of	1
intermeddling	1
in	1
their	1
affairs.	1
A	1
Macedonian	1
army	1
quickly	1
appeared.	1
Cleomenes	1
was	1
vanquished.	1
The	1
Achaeans	1
soon	1
experienced,	1
as	1
often	1
happens,	1
that	1
a	1
victorious	1
and	1
powerful	1
ally	1
is	1
but	1
another	1
name	1
for	1
a	1
master.	1
All	1
that	1
their	1
most	1
abject	1
compliances	1
could	1
obtain	1
from	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
toleration	1
of	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
their	1
laws.	1
Philip,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
Macedon,	1
soon	1
provoked	1
by	1
his	1
tyrannies,	1
fresh	1
combinations	1
among	1
the	1
Greeks.	1
The	1
Achaeans,	1
though	1
weakened	1
by	1
internal	1
dissensions	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
revolt	1
of	1
Messene,	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
members,	1
being	1
joined	1
by	1
the	1
AEtolians	1
and	1
Athenians,	1
erected	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
opposition.	1
Finding	1
themselves,	1
though	1
thus	1
supported,	1
unequal	1
to	1
the	1
undertaking,	1
they	1
once	1
more	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
dangerous	1
expedient	1
of	1
introducing	1
the	1
succor	1
of	1
foreign	1
arms.	1
The	1
Romans,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
invitation	1
was	1
made,	1
eagerly	1
embraced	1
it.	1
Philip	1
was	1
conquered;	1
Macedon	1
subdued.	1
A	1
new	1
crisis	1
ensued	1
to	1
the	1
league.	1
Dissensions	1
broke	1
out	1
among	1
it	1
members.	1
These	1
the	1
Romans	1
fostered.	1
Callicrates	1
and	1
other	1
popular	1
leaders	1
became	1
mercenary	1
instruments	1
for	1
inveigling	1
their	1
countrymen.	1
The	1
more	1
effectually	1
to	1
nourish	1
discord	1
and	1
disorder	1
the	1
Romans	1
had,	1
to	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
confided	1
in	1
their	1
sincerity,	1
already	1
proclaimed	1
universal	1
liberty1	1
throughout	1
Greece.	1
With	1
the	1
same	1
insidious	1
views,	1
they	1
now	1
seduced	1
the	1
members	1
from	1
the	1
league,	1
by	1
representing	1
to	1
their	1
pride	1
the	1
violation	1
it	1
committed	1
on	1
their	1
sovereignty.	1
By	1
these	1
arts	1
this	1
union,	1
the	1
last	1
hope	1
of	1
Greece,	1
the	1
last	1
hope	1
of	1
ancient	1
liberty,	1
was	1
torn	1
into	1
pieces;	1
and	1
such	1
imbecility	1
and	1
distraction	1
introduced,	1
that	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
Rome	1
found	1
little	1
difficulty	1
in	1
completing	1
the	1
ruin	1
which	1
their	1
arts	1
had	1
commenced.	1
The	1
Achaeans	1
were	1
cut	1
to	1
pieces,	1
and	1
Achaia	1
loaded	1
with	1
chains,	1
under	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
groaning	1
at	1
this	1
hour.	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
it	1
not	1
superfluous	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
outlines	1
of	1
this	1
important	1
portion	1
of	1
history;	1
both	1
because	1
it	1
teaches	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
lesson,	1
and	1
because,	1
as	1
a	1
supplement	1
to	1
the	1
outlines	1
of	1
the	1
Achaean	1
constitution,	1
it	1
emphatically	1
illustrates	1
the	1
tendency	1
of	1
federal	1
bodies	1
rather	1
to	1
anarchy	1
among	1
the	1
members,	1
than	1
to	1
tyranny	1
in	1
the	1
head.	1
PUBLIUS.	1
1	1
This	1
was	1
but	1
another	1
name	1
more	1
specious	1
for	1
the	1
independence	1
of	1
the	1

on	1
the	1
federal	1

THE	1
examples	1
of	1
ancient	1
confederacies,	1
cited	1
in	1
my	1
last	1
paper,	1
have	1
not	1
exhausted	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
experimental	1
instruction	1
on	1
this	1
subject.	1
There	1
are	1
existing	1
institutions,	1
founded	1
on	1
a	1
similar	1
principle,	1
which	1
merit	1
particular	1
consideration.	1
The	1
first	1
which	1
presents	1
itself	1
is	1
the	1
Germanic	1
body.	1
In	1
the	1
early	1
ages	1
of	1
Christianity,	1
Germany	1
was	1
occupied	1
by	1
seven	1
distinct	1
nations,	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
common	1
chief.	1
The	1
Franks,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
number,	1
having	1
conquered	1
the	1
Gauls,	1
established	1
the	1
kingdom	1
which	1
has	1
taken	1
its	1
name	1
from	1
them.	1
In	1
the	1
ninth	1
century	1
Charlemagne,	1
its	1
warlike	1
monarch,	1
carried	1
his	1
victorious	1
arms	1
in	1
every	1
direction;	1
and	1
Germany	1
became	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
vast	1
dominions.	1
On	1
the	1
dismemberment,	1
which	1
took	1
place	1
under	1
his	1
sons,	1
this	1
part	1
was	1
erected	1
into	1
a	1
separate	1
and	1
independent	1
empire.	1
Charlemagne	1
and	1
his	1
immediate	1
descendants	1
possessed	1
the	1
reality,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
ensigns	1
and	1
dignity	1
of	1
imperial	1
power.	1
But	1
the	1
principal	1
vassals,	1
whose	1
fiefs	1
had	1
become	1
hereditary,	1
and	1
who	1
composed	1
the	1
national	1
diets	1
which	1
Charlemagne	1
had	1
not	1
abolished,	1
gradually	1
threw	1
off	1
the	1
yoke	1
and	1
advanced	1
to	1
sovereign	1
jurisdiction	1
and	1
independence.	1
The	1
force	1
of	1
imperial	1
sovereignty	1
was	1
insufficient	1
to	1
restrain	1
such	1
powerful	1
dependants;	1
or	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
unity	1
and	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
the	1
empire.	1
The	1
most	1
furious	1
private	1
wars,	1
accompanied	1
with	1
every	1
species	1
of	1
calamity,	1
were	1
carried	1
on	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
princes	1
and	1
states.	1
The	1
imperial	1
authority,	1
unable	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
public	1
order,	1
declined	1
by	1
degrees	1
till	1
it	1
was	1
almost	1
extinct	1
in	1
the	1
anarchy,	1
which	1
agitated	1
the	1
long	1
interval	1
between	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
emperor	1
of	1
the	1
Suabian,	1
and	1
the	1
accession	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
emperor	1
of	1
the	1
Austrian	1
lines.	1
In	1
the	1
eleventh	1
century	1
the	1
emperors	1
enjoyed	1
full	1
sovereignty:	1
In	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
they	1
had	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
symbols	1
and	1
decorations	1
of	1
power.	1
Out	1
of	1
this	1
feudal	1
system,	1
which	1
has	1
itself	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
important	1
features	1
of	1
a	1
confederacy,	1
has	1
grown	1
the	1
federal	1
system	1
which	1
constitutes	1
the	1
Germanic	1
empire.	1
Its	1
powers	1
are	1
vested	1
in	1
a	1
diet	1
representing	1
the	1
component	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
confederacy;	1
in	1
the	1
emperor,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate,	1
with	1
a	1
negative	1
on	1
the	1
decrees	1
of	1
the	1
diet;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
imperial	1
chamber	1
and	1
the	1
aulic	1
council,	1
two	1
judiciary	1
tribunals	1
having	1
supreme	1
jurisdiction	1
in	1
controversies	1
which	1
concern	1
the	1
empire,	1
or	1
which	1
happen	1
among	1
its	1
members.	1
The	1
diet	1
possesses	1
the	1
general	1
power	1
of	1
legislating	1
for	1
the	1
empire;	1
of	1
making	1
war	1
and	1
peace;	1
contracting	1
alliances;	1
assessing	1
quotas	1
of	1
troops	1
and	1
money;	1
constructing	1
fortresses;	1
regulating	1
coin;	1
admitting	1
new	1
members;	1
and	1
subjecting	1
disobedient	1
members	1
to	1
the	1
ban	1
of	1
the	1
empire,	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
party	1
is	1
degraded	1
from	1
his	1
sovereign	1
rights	1
and	1
his	1
possessions	1
forfeited.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
confederacy	1
are	1
expressly	1
restricted	1
from	1
entering	1
into	1
compacts	1
prejudicial	1
to	1
the	1
empire;	1
from	1
imposing	1
tolls	1
and	1
duties	1
on	1
their	1
mutual	1
intercourse,	1
without	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
emperor	1
and	1
diet;	1
from	1
altering	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
money;	1
from	1
doing	1
injustice	1
to	1
one	1
another;	1
or	1
from	1
affording	1
assistance	1
or	1
retreat	1
to	1
disturbers	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
peace.	1
And	1
the	1
ban	1
is	1
denounced	1
against	1
such	1
as	1
shall	1
violate	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
restrictions.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
diet,	1
as	1
such,	1
are	1
subject	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
to	1
be	1
judged	1
by	1
the	1
emperor	1
and	1
diet,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
private	1
capacities	1
by	1
the	1
aulic	1
council	1
and	1
imperial	1
chamber.	1
The	1
prerogatives	1
of	1
the	1
emperor	1
are	1
numerous.	1
The	1
most	1
important	1
of	1
them	1
are:	1
his	1
exclusive	1
right	1
to	1
make	1
propositions	1
to	1
the	1
diet;	1
to	1
negative	1
its	1
resolutions;	1
to	1
name	1
ambassadors;	1
to	1
confer	1
dignities	1
and	1
titles;	1
to	1
fill	1
vacant	1
electorates;	1
to	1
found	1
universities;	1
to	1
grant	1
privileges	1
not	1
injurious	1
to	1
the	1
states	1
of	1
the	1
empire;	1
to	1
receive	1
and	1
apply	1
the	1
public	1
revenues;	1
and	1
generally	1
to	1
watch	1
over	1
the	1
public	1
safety.	1
In	1
certain	1
cases,	1
the	1
electors	1
form	1
a	1
council	1
to	1
him.	1
In	1
quality	1
of	1
emperor,	1
he	1
possesses	1
no	1
territory	1
within	1
the	1
empire,	1
nor	1
receives	1
any	1
revenue	1
for	1
his	1
support.	1
But	1
his	1
revenue	1
and	1
dominions,	1
in	1
other	1
qualities,	1
constitute	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
powerful	1
princes	1
in	1
Europe.	1
From	1
such	1
a	1
parade	1
of	1
constitutional	1
powers,	1
in	1
the	1
representatives	1
and	1
head	1
of	1
this	1
confederacy,	1
the	1
natural	1
supposition	1
would	1
be,	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
form	1
an	1
exception	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
character	1
which	1
belongs	1
to	1
its	1
kindred	1
systems.	1
Nothing	1
would	1
be	1
further	1
from	1
the	1
reality.	1
The	1
fundamental	1
principle	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
rests,	1
that	1
the	1
empire	1
is	1
a	1
community	1
of	1
sovereigns,	1
that	1
the	1
diet	1
is	1
a	1
representation	1
of	1
sovereigns	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
laws	1
are	1
addressed	1
to	1
sovereigns,	1
renders	1
the	1
empire	1
a	1
nerveless	1
body,	1
incapable	1
of	1
regulating	1
its	1
own	1
members,	1
insecure	1
against	1
external	1
dangers,	1
and	1
agitated	1
with	1
unceasing	1
fermentations	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
bowels.	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
Germany	1
is	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
wars	1
between	1
the	1
emperor	1
and	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
states;	1
of	1
wars	1
among	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
states	1
themselves;	1
of	1
the	1
licentiousness	1
of	1
the	1
strong,	1
and	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
weak;	1
of	1
foreign	1
intrusions,	1
and	1
foreign	1
intrigues;	1
of	1
requisitions	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
money	1
disregarded,	1
or	1
partially	1
complied	1
with;	1
of	1
attempts	1
to	1
enforce	1
them,	1
altogether	1
abortive,	1
or	1
attended	1
with	1
slaughter	1
and	1
desolation,	1
involving	1
the	1
innocent	1
with	1
the	1
guilty;	1
of	1
general	1
inbecility,	1
confusion,	1
and	1
misery.	1
In	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
century,	1
the	1
emperor,	1
with	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
empire	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
was	1
seen	1
engaged	1
against	1
the	1
other	1
princes	1
and	1
states.	1
In	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
conflicts,	1
the	1
emperor	1
himself	1
was	1
put	1
to	1
flight,	1
and	1
very	1
near	1
being	1
made	1
prisoner	1
by	1
the	1
elector	1
of	1
Saxony.	1
The	1
late	1
king	1
of	1
Prussia	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
pitted	1
against	1
his	1
imperial	1
sovereign;	1
and	1
commonly	1
proved	1
an	1
overmatch	1
for	1
him.	1
Controversies	1
and	1
wars	1
among	1
the	1
members	1
themselves	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
common,	1
that	1
the	1
German	1
annals	1
are	1
crowded	1
with	1
the	1
bloody	1
pages	1
which	1
describe	1
them.	1
Previous	1
to	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
Westphalia,	1
Germany	1
was	1
desolated	1
by	1
a	1
war	1
of	1
thirty	1
years,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
emperor,	1
with	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
empire,	1
was	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
Sweden,	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
half,	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side.	1
Peace	1
was	1
at	1
length	1
negotiated,	1
and	1
dictated	1
by	1
foreign	1
powers;	1
and	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
it,	1
to	1
which	1
foreign	1
powers	1
are	1
parties,	1
made	1
a	1
fundamental	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Germanic	1
constitution.	1
If	1
the	1
nation	1
happens,	1
on	1
any	1
emergency,	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
united	1
by	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
self-defense,	1
its	1
situation	1
is	1
still	1
deplorable.	1
Military	1
preparations	1
must	1
be	1
preceded	1
by	1
so	1
many	1
tedious	1
discussions,	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
jealousies,	1
pride,	1
separate	1
views,	1
and	1
clashing	1
pretensions	1
of	1
sovereign	1
bodies,	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
diet	1
can	1
settle	1
the	1
arrangements,	1
the	1
enemy	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
field;	1
and	1
before	1
the	1
federal	1
troops	1
are	1
ready	1
to	1
take	1
it,	1
are	1
retiring	1
into	1
winter	1
quarters.	1
The	1
small	1
body	1
of	1
national	1
troops,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
judged	1
necessary	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace,	1
is	1
defectively	1
kept	1
up,	1
badly	1
paid,	1
infected	1
with	1
local	1
prejudices,	1
and	1
supported	1
by	1
irregular	1
and	1
disproportionate	1
contributions	1
to	1
the	1
treasury.	1
The	1
impossibility	1
of	1
maintaining	1
order	1
and	1
dispensing	1
justice	1
among	1
these	1
sovereign	1
subjects,	1
produced	1
the	1
experiment	1
of	1
dividing	1
the	1
empire	1
into	1
nine	1
or	1
ten	1
circles	1
or	1
districts;	1
of	1
giving	1
them	1
an	1
interior	1
organization,	1
and	1
of	1
charging	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
military	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
against	1
delinquent	1
and	1
contumacious	1
members.	1
This	1
experiment	1
has	1
only	1
served	1
to	1
demonstrate	1
more	1
fully	1
the	1
radical	1
vice	1
of	1
the	1
constitution.	1
Each	1
circle	1
is	1
the	1
miniature	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
deformities	1
of	1
this	1
political	1
monster.	1
They	1
either	1
fail	1
to	1
execute	1
their	1
commissions,	1
or	1
they	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
devastation	1
and	1
carnage	1
of	1
civil	1
war.	1
Sometimes	1
whole	1
circles	1
are	1
defaulters;	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
increase	1
the	1
mischief	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
instituted	1
to	1
remedy.	1
We	1
may	1
form	1
some	1
judgment	1
of	1
this	1
scheme	1
of	1
military	1
coercion	1
from	1
a	1
sample	1
given	1
by	1
Thuanus.	1
In	1
Donawerth,	1
a	1
free	1
and	1
imperial	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
Suabia,	1
the	1
Abb	1
300	1
de	1
St.	1
Croix	1
enjoyed	1
certain	1
immunities	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
reserved	1
to	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
these,	1
on	1
some	1
public	1
occasions,	1
outrages	1
were	1
committed	1
on	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
The	1
consequence	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
put	1
under	1
the	1
ban	1
of	1
the	1
empire,	1
and	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Bavaria,	1
though	1
director	1
of	1
another	1
circle,	1
obtained	1
an	1
appointment	1
to	1
enforce	1
it.	1
He	1
soon	1
appeared	1
before	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
a	1
corps	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand	1
troops,	1
and	1
finding	1
it	1
a	1
fit	1
occasion,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
secretly	1
intended	1
from	1
the	1
beginning,	1
to	1
revive	1
an	1
antiquated	1
claim,	1
on	1
the	1
pretext	1
that	1
his	1
ancestors	1
had	1
suffered	1
the	1
place	1
to	1
be	1
dismembered	1
from	1
his	1
territory,1	1
he	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
name,	1
disarmed,	1
and	1
punished	1
the	1
inhabitants,	1
and	1
reannexed	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
his	1
domains.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
asked,	1
perhaps,	1
what	1
has	1
so	1
long	1
kept	1
this	1
disjointed	1
machine	1
from	1
falling	1
entirely	1
to	1
pieces?	1
The	1
answer	1
is	1
obvious:	1
The	1
weakness	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
members,	1
who	1
are	1
unwilling	1
to	1
expose	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
foreign	1
powers;	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
members,	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
formidable	1
powers	1
all	1
around	1
them;	1
the	1
vast	1
weight	1
and	1
influence	1
which	1
the	1
emperor	1
derives	1
from	1
his	1
separate	1
and	1
heriditary	1
dominions;	1
and	1
the	1
interest	1
he	1
feels	1
in	1
preserving	1
a	1
system	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
family	1
pride	1
is	1
connected,	1
and	1
which	1
constitutes	1
him	1
the	1
first	1
prince	1
in	1
Europe;	1
--these	1
causes	1
support	1
a	1
feeble	1
and	1
precarious	1
Union;	1
whilst	1
the	1
repellant	1
quality,	1
incident	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
sovereignty,	1
and	1
which	1
time	1
continually	1
strengthens,	1
prevents	1
any	1
reform	1
whatever,	1
founded	1
on	1
a	1
proper	1
consolidation.	1
Nor	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
imagined,	1
if	1
this	1
obstacle	1
could	1
be	1
surmounted,	1
that	1
the	1
neighboring	1
powers	1
would	1
suffer	1
a	1
revolution	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
which	1
would	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
empire	1
the	1
force	1
and	1
preeminence	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
entitled.	1
Foreign	1
nations	1
have	1
long	1
considered	1
themselves	1
as	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
changes	1
made	1
by	1
events	1
in	1
this	1
constitution;	1
and	1
have,	1
on	1
various	1
occasions,	1
betrayed	1
their	1
policy	1
of	1
perpetuating	1
its	1
anarchy	1
and	1
weakness.	1
If	1
more	1
direct	1
examples	1
were	1
wanting,	1
Poland,	1
as	1
a	1
government	1
over	1
local	1
sovereigns,	1
might	1
not	1
improperly	1
be	1
taken	1
notice	1
of.	1
Nor	1
could	1
any	1
proof	1
more	1
striking	1
be	1
given	1
of	1
the	1
calamities	1
flowing	1
from	1
such	1
institutions.	1
Equally	1
unfit	1
for	1
self-government	1
and	1
self-defense,	1
it	1
has	1
long	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
its	1
powerful	1
neighbors;	1
who	1
have	1
lately	1
had	1
the	1
mercy	1
to	1
disburden	1
it	1
of	1
one	1
third	1
of	1
its	1
people	1
and	1
territories.	1
The	1
connection	1
among	1
the	1
Swiss	1
cantons	1
scarcely	1
amounts	1
to	1
a	1
confederacy;	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
sometimes	1
cited	1
as	1
an	1
instance	1
of	1
the	1
stability	1
of	1
such	1
institutions.	1
They	1
have	1
no	1
common	1
treasury;	1
no	1
common	1
troops	1
even	1
in	1
war;	1
no	1
common	1
coin;	1
no	1
common	1
judicatory;	1
nor	1
any	1
other	1
common	1
mark	1
of	1
sovereignty.	1
They	1
are	1
kept	1
together	1
by	1
the	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
their	1
topographical	1
position;	1
by	1
their	1
individual	1
weakness	1
and	1
insignificancy;	1
by	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
powerful	1
neighbors,	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
formerly	1
subject;	1
by	1
the	1
few	1
sources	1
of	1
contention	1
among	1
a	1
people	1
of	1
such	1
simple	1
and	1
homogeneous	1
manners;	1
by	1
their	1
joint	1
interest	1
in	1
their	1
dependent	1
possessions;	1
by	1
the	1
mutual	1
aid	1
they	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of,	1
for	1
suppressing	1
insurrections	1
and	1
rebellions,	1
an	1
aid	1
expressly	1
stipulated	1
and	1
often	1
required	1
and	1
afforded;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
some	1
regular	1
and	1
permanent	1
provision	1
for	1
accomodating	1
disputes	1
among	1
the	1
cantons.	1
The	1
provision	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
parties	1
at	1
variance	1
shall	1
each	1
choose	1
four	1
judges	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
neutral	1
cantons,	1
who,	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
disagreement,	1
choose	1
an	1
umpire.	1
This	1
tribunal,	1
under	1
an	1
oath	1
of	1
impartiality,	1
pronounces	1
definitive	1
sentence,	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
cantons	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
enforce.	1
The	1
competency	1
of	1
this	1
regulation	1
may	1
be	1
estimated	1
by	1
a	1
clause	1
in	1
their	1
treaty	1
of	1
1683,	1
with	1
Victor	1
Amadeus	1
of	1
Savoy;	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
obliges	1
himself	1
to	1
interpose	1
as	1
mediator	1
in	1
disputes	1
between	1
the	1
cantons,	1
and	1
to	1
employ	1
force,	1
if	1
necessary,	1
against	1
the	1
contumacious	1
party.	1
So	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
their	1
case	1
will	1
admit	1
of	1
comparison	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
it	1
serves	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
principle	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
established.	1
Whatever	1
efficacy	1
the	1
union	1
may	1
have	1
had	1
in	1
ordinary	1
cases,	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
the	1
moment	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
difference	1
sprang	1
up,	1
capable	1
of	1
trying	1
its	1
strength,	1
it	1
failed.	1
The	1
controversies	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
religion,	1
which	1
in	1
three	1
instances	1
have	1
kindled	1
violent	1
and	1
bloody	1
contests,	1
may	1
be	1
said,	1
in	1
fact,	1
to	1
have	1
severed	1
the	1
league.	1
The	1
Protestant	1
and	1
Catholic	1
cantons	1
have	1
since	1
had	1
their	1
separate	1
diets,	1
where	1
all	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
concerns	1
are	1
adjusted,	1
and	1
which	1
have	1
left	1
the	1
general	1
diet	1
little	1
other	1
business	1
than	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
bailages.	1
That	1
separation	1
had	1
another	1
consequence,	1
which	1
merits	1
attention.	1
It	1
produced	1
opposite	1
alliances	1
with	1
foreign	1
powers:	1

the	1

of	1

and	1
of	1

To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1

THE	1
United	1
Netherlands	1
are	1
a	1
confederacy	1
of	1
republics,	1
or	1
rather	1
of	1
aristocracies	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
remarkable	1
texture,	1
yet	1
confirming	1
all	1
the	1
lessons	1
derived	1
from	1
those	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
reviewed.	1
The	1
union	1
is	1
composed	1
of	1
seven	1
coequal	1
and	1
sovereign	1
states,	1
and	1
each	1
state	1
or	1
province	1
is	1
a	1
composition	1
of	1
equal	1
and	1
independent	1
cities.	1
In	1
all	1
important	1
cases,	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
provinces	1
but	1
the	1
cities	1
must	1
be	1
unanimous.	1
The	1
sovereignty	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
is	1
represented	1
by	1
the	1
States-General,	1
consisting	1
usually	1
of	1
about	1
fifty	1
deputies	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
provinces.	1
They	1
hold	1
their	1
seats,	1
some	1
for	1
life,	1
some	1
for	1
six,	1
three,	1
and	1
one	1
years;	1
from	1
two	1
provinces	1
they	1
continue	1
in	1
appointment	1
during	1
pleasure.	1
The	1
States-General	1
have	1
authority	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
treaties	1
and	1
alliances;	1
to	1
make	1
war	1
and	1
peace;	1
to	1
raise	1
armies	1
and	1
equip	1
fleets;	1
to	1
ascertain	1
quotas	1
and	1
demand	1
contributions.	1
In	1
all	1
these	1
cases,	1
however,	1
unanimity	1
and	1
the	1
sanction	1
of	1
their	1
constituents	1
are	1
requisite.	1
They	1
have	1
authority	1
to	1
appoint	1
and	1
receive	1
ambassadors;	1
to	1
execute	1
treaties	1
and	1
alliances	1
already	1
formed;	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
the	1
collection	1
of	1
duties	1
on	1
imports	1
and	1
exports;	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
mint,	1
with	1
a	1
saving	1
to	1
the	1
provincial	1
rights;	1
to	1
govern	1
as	1
sovereigns	1
the	1
dependent	1
territories.	1
The	1
provinces	1
are	1
restrained,	1
unless	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
consent,	1
from	1
entering	1
into	1
foreign	1
treaties;	1
from	1
establishing	1
imposts	1
injurious	1
to	1
others,	1
or	1
charging	1
their	1
neighbors	1
with	1
higher	1
duties	1
than	1
their	1
own	1
subjects.	1
A	1
council	1
of	1
state,	1
a	1
chamber	1
of	1
accounts,	1
with	1
five	1
colleges	1
of	1
admiralty,	1
aid	1
and	1
fortify	1
the	1
federal	1
administration.	1
The	1
executive	1
magistrate	1
of	1
the	1
union	1
is	1
the	1
stadtholder,	1
who	1
is	1
now	1
an	1
hereditary	1
prince.	1
His	1
principal	1
weight	1
and	1
influence	1
in	1
the	1
republic	1
are	1
derived	1
from	1
this	1
independent	1
title;	1
from	1
his	1
great	1
patrimonial	1
estates;	1
from	1
his	1
family	1
connections	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
potentates	1
of	1
Europe;	1
and,	1
more	1
than	1
all,	1
perhaps,	1
from	1
his	1
being	1
stadtholder	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
provinces,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
union;	1
in	1
which	1
provincial	1
quality	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
town	1
magistrates	1
under	1
certain	1
regulations,	1
executes	1
provincial	1
decrees,	1
presides	1
when	1
he	1
pleases	1
in	1
the	1
provincial	1
tribunals,	1
and	1
has	1
throughout	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
pardon.	1
As	1
stadtholder	1
of	1
the	1
union,	1
he	1
has,	1
however,	1
considerable	1
prerogatives.	1
In	1
his	1
political	1
capacity	1
he	1
has	1
authority	1
to	1
settle	1
disputes	1
between	1
the	1
provinces,	1
when	1
other	1
methods	1
fail;	1
to	1
assist	1
at	1
the	1
deliberations	1
of	1
the	1
States-General,	1
and	1
at	1
their	1
particular	1
conferences;	1
to	1
give	1
audiences	1
to	1
foreign	1
ambassadors,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
agents	1
for	1
his	1
particular	1
affairs	1
at	1
foreign	1
courts.	1
In	1
his	1
military	1
capacity	1
he	1
commands	1
the	1
federal	1
troops,	1
provides	1
for	1
garrisons,	1
and	1
in	1
general	1
regulates	1
military	1
affairs;	1
disposes	1
of	1
all	1
appointments,	1
from	1
colonels	1
to	1
ensigns,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
governments	1
and	1
posts	1
of	1
fortified	1
towns.	1
In	1
his	1
marine	1
capacity	1
he	1
is	1
admiral-general,	1
and	1
superintends	1
and	1
directs	1
every	1
thing	1
relative	1
to	1
naval	1
forces	1
and	1
other	1
naval	1
affairs;	1
presides	1
in	1
the	1
admiralties	1
in	1
person	1
or	1
by	1
proxy;	1
appoints	1
lieutenant-admirals	1
and	1
other	1
officers;	1
and	1
establishes	1
councils	1
of	1
war,	1
whose	1
sentences	1
are	1
not	1
executed	1
till	1
he	1
approves	1
them.	1
His	1
revenue,	1
exclusive	1
of	1
his	1
private	1
income,	1
amounts	1
to	1
three	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
florins.	1
The	1
standing	1
army	1
which	1
he	1
commands	1
consists	1
of	1
about	1
forty	1
thousand	1
men.	1
Such	1
is	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Belgic	1
confederacy,	1
as	1
delineated	1
on	1
parchment.	1
What	1
are	1
the	1
characters	1
which	1
practice	1
has	1
stamped	1
upon	1
it?	1
Imbecility	1
in	1
the	1
government;	1
discord	1
among	1
the	1
provinces;	1
foreign	1
influence	1
and	1
indignities;	1
a	1
precarious	1
existence	1
in	1
peace,	1
and	1
peculiar	1
calamities	1
from	1
war.	1
It	1
was	1
long	1
ago	1
remarked	1
by	1
Grotius,	1
that	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
hatred	1
of	1
his	1
countrymen	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Austria	1
kept	1
them	1
from	1
being	1
ruined	1
by	1
the	1
vices	1
of	1
their	1
constitution.	1
The	1
union	1
of	1
Utrecht,	1
says	1
another	1
respectable	1
writer,	1
reposes	1
an	1
authority	1
in	1
the	1
States-General,	1
seemingly	1
sufficient	1
to	1
secure	1
harmony,	1
but	1
the	1
jealousy	1
in	1
each	1
province	1
renders	1
the	1
practice	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
theory.	1
The	1
same	1
instrument,	1
says	1
another,	1
obliges	1
each	1
province	1
to	1
levy	1
certain	1
contributions;	1
but	1
this	1
article	1
never	1
could,	1
and	1
probably	1
never	1
will,	1
be	1
executed;	1
because	1
the	1
inland	1
provinces,	1
who	1
have	1
little	1
commerce,	1
cannot	1
pay	1
an	1
equal	1
quota.	1
In	1
matters	1
of	1
contribution,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
practice	1
to	1
waive	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
the	1
constitution.	1
The	1
danger	1
of	1
delay	1
obliges	1
the	1
consenting	1
provinces	1
to	1
furnish	1
their	1
quotas,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
others;	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
obtain	1
reimbursement	1
from	1
the	1
others,	1
by	1
deputations,	1
which	1
are	1
frequent,	1
or	1
otherwise,	1
as	1
they	1
can.	1
The	1
great	1
wealth	1
and	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
Holland	1
enable	1
her	1
to	1
effect	1
both	1
these	1
purposes.	1
It	1
has	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
happened,	1
that	1
the	1
deficiencies	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
ultimately	1
collected	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
bayonet;	1
a	1
thing	1
practicable,	1
though	1
dreadful,	1
in	1
a	1
confedracy	1
where	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
exceeds	1
in	1
force	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
and	1
where	1
several	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
too	1
small	1
to	1
meditate	1
resistance;	1
but	1
utterly	1
impracticable	1
in	1
one	1
composed	1
of	1
members,	1
several	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
equal	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
strength	1
and	1
resources,	1
and	1
equal	1
singly	1
to	1
a	1
vigorous	1
and	1
persevering	1
defense.	1
Foreign	1
ministers,	1
says	1
Sir	1
William	1
Temple,	1
who	1
was	1
himself	1
a	1
foreign	1
minister,	1
elude	1
matters	1
taken	1
ad	1
referendum,	1
by	1
tampering	1
with	1
the	1
provinces	1
and	1
cities.	1
In	1
1726,	1
the	1
treaty	1
of	1
Hanover	1
was	1
delayed	1
by	1
these	1
means	1
a	1
whole	1
year.	1
Instances	1
of	1
a	1
like	1
nature	1
are	1
numerous	1
and	1
notorious.	1
In	1
critical	1
emergencies,	1
the	1
States-General	1
are	1
often	1
compelled	1
to	1
overleap	1
their	1
constitutional	1
bounds.	1
In	1
1688,	1
they	1
concluded	1
a	1
treaty	1
of	1
themselves	1
at	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
their	1
heads.	1
The	1
treaty	1
of	1
Westphalia,	1
in	1
1648,	1
by	1
which	1
their	1
independence	1
was	1
formerly	1
and	1
finally	1
recognized,	1
was	1
concluded	1
without	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
Zealand.	1
Even	1
as	1
recently	1
as	1
the	1
last	1
treaty	1
of	1
peace	1
with	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
the	1
constitutional	1
principle	1
of	1
unanimity	1
was	1
departed	1
from.	1
A	1
weak	1
constitution	1
must	1
necessarily	1
terminate	1
in	1
dissolution,	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
proper	1
powers,	1
or	1
the	1
usurpation	1
of	1
powers	1
requisite	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
safety.	1
Whether	1
the	1
usurpation,	1
when	1
once	1
begun,	1
will	1
stop	1
at	1
the	1
salutary	1
point,	1
or	1
go	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
dangerous	1
extreme,	1
must	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
contingencies	1
of	1
the	1
moment.	1
Tyranny	1
has	1
perhaps	1
oftener	1
grown	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
assumptions	1
of	1
power,	1
called	1
for,	1
on	1
pressing	1
exigencies,	1
by	1
a	1
defective	1
constitution,	1
than	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
full	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
constitutional	1
authorities.	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
calamities	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
stadtholdership,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
supposed	1
that	1
without	1
his	1
influence	1
in	1
the	1
individual	1
provinces,	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
anarchy	1
manifest	1
in	1
the	1
confederacy	1
would	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
dissolved	1
it.	1
"Under	1
such	1
a	1
government,"	1
says	1
the	1
Abbe	1
Mably,	1
"the	1
Union	1
could	1
never	1
have	1
subsisted,	1
if	1
the	1
provinces	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
spring	1
within	1
themselves,	1
capable	1
of	1
quickening	1
their	1
tardiness,	1
and	1
compelling	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
of	1
thinking.	1
This	1
spring	1
is	1
the	1
stadtholder."	1
It	1
is	1
remarked	1
by	1
Sir	1
William	1
Temple,	1
"that	1
in	1
the	1
intermissions	1
of	1
the	1
stadtholdership,	1
Holland,	1
by	1
her	1
riches	1
and	1
her	1
authority,	1
which	1
drew	1
the	1
others	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
dependence,	1
supplied	1
the	1
place."	1
These	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
circumstances	1
which	1
have	1
controlled	1
the	1
tendency	1
to	1
anarchy	1
and	1
dissolution.	1
The	1
surrounding	1
powers	1
impose	1
an	1
absolute	1
necessity	1
of	1
union	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
degree,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
they	1
nourish	1
by	1
their	1
intrigues	1
the	1
constitutional	1
vices	1
which	1
keep	1
the	1
republic	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
always	1
at	1
their	1
mercy.	1
The	1
true	1
patriots	1
have	1
long	1
bewailed	1
the	1
fatal	1
tendency	1
of	1
these	1
vices,	1
and	1
have	1
made	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
four	1
regular	1
experiments	1
by	1
EXTRAORDINARY	1
ASSEMBLIES,	1
convened	1
for	1
the	1
special	1
purpose,	1
to	1
apply	1
a	1
remedy.	1
As	1
many	1
times	1
has	1
their	1
laudable	1
zeal	1
found	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
UNITE	1
THE	1
PUBLIC	1
COUNCILS	1
in	1
reforming	1
the	1
known,	1
the	1
acknowledged,	1
the	1
fatal	1
evils	1
of	1
the	1
existing	1
constitution.	1
Let	1
us	1
pause,	1
my	1
fellow-citizens,	1
for	1
one	1
moment,	1
over	1
this	1
melancholy	1
and	1
monitory	1
lesson	1
of	1
history;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
tear	1
that	1
drops	1
for	1
the	1
calamities	1
brought	1
on	1
mankind	1
by	1
their	1
adverse	1
opinions	1
and	1
selfish	1
passions,	1
let	1
our	1
gratitude	1
mingle	1
an	1
ejaculation	1
to	1
Heaven,	1
for	1
the	1
propitious	1
concord	1
which	1
has	1
distinguished	1
the	1
consultations	1
for	1
our	1
political	1
happiness.	1
A	1
design	1
was	1
also	1
conceived	1
of	1
establishing	1
a	1
general	1
tax	1
to	1
be	1
administered	1
by	1
the	1
federal	1
authority.	1
This	1
also	1
had	1
its	1
adversaries	1
and	1
failed.	1
This	1
unhappy	1
people	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
now	1
suffering	1
from	1
popular	1
convulsions,	1
from	1
dissensions	1
among	1
the	1
states,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
actual	1
invasion	1
of	1
foreign	1
arms,	1
the	1
crisis	1
of	1
their	1
destiny.	1
All	1
nations	1
have	1
their	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
awful	1
spectacle.	1
The	1
first	1
wish	1
prompted	1
by	1
humanity	1
is,	1
that	1
this	1
severe	1
trial	1
may	1
issue	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
revolution	1
of	1
their	1
government	1
as	1
will	1
establish	1
their	1
union,	1
and	1
render	1
it	1
the	1
parent	1
of	1
tranquillity,	1
freedom	1
and	1
happiness:	1
The	1
next,	1
that	1
the	1
asylum	1
under	1
which,	1
we	1
trust,	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
these	1
blessings	1
will	1
speedily	1
be	1
secured	1
in	1
this	1
country,	1
may	1
receive	1
and	1
console	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
catastrophe	1
of	1
their	1
own.	1
I	1
make	1
no	1
apology	1
for	1
having	1
dwelt	1
so	1
long	1
on	1
the	1
contemplation	1
of	1
these	1
federal	1
precedents.	1
Experience	1
is	1
the	1
oracle	1
of	1
truth;	1
and	1
where	1
its	1
responses	1
are	1
unequivocal,	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
conclusive	1
and	1
sacred.	1
The	1
important	1
truth,	1
which	1
it	1
unequivocally	1
pronounces	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case,	1
is	1
that	1
a	1
sovereignty	1
over	1
sovereigns,	1
a	1
government	1
over	1
governments,	1
a	1
legislation	1
for	1
communities,	1
as	1
contradistinguished	1
from	1
individuals,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
solecism	1
in	1
theory,	1
so	1
in	1
practice	1
it	1
is	1
subversive	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
and	1
ends	1
of	1
civil	1
polity,	1
by	1
substituting	1
VIOLENCE	1
in	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
HAVING	1
in	1
the	1
three	1
last	1
numbers	1
taken	1
a	1
summary	1
review	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
circumstances	1
and	1
events	1
which	1
have	1
depicted	1
the	1
genius	1
and	1
fate	1
of	1
other	1
confederate	1
governments,	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
proceed	1
in	1
the	1
enumeration	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
of	1
those	1
defects	1
which	1
have	1
hitherto	1
disappointed	1
our	1
hopes	1
from	1
the	1
system	1
established	1
among	1
ourselves.	1
To	1
form	1
a	1
safe	1
and	1
satisfactory	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
proper	1
remedy,	1
it	1
is	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
extent	1
and	1
malignity	1
of	1
the	1
disease.	1
The	1
next	1
most	1
palpable	1
defect	1
of	1
the	1
subsisting	1
Confederation,	1
is	1
the	1
total	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
SANCTION	1
to	1
its	1
laws.	1
The	1
United	1
States,	1
as	1
now	1
composed,	1
have	1
no	1
powers	1
to	1
exact	1
obedience,	1
or	1
punish	1
disobedience	1
to	1
their	1
resolutions,	1
either	1
by	1
pecuniary	1
mulcts,	1
by	1
a	1
suspension	1
or	1
divestiture	1
of	1
privileges,	1
or	1
by	1
any	1
other	1
constitutional	1
mode.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
express	1
delegation	1
of	1
authority	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
use	1
force	1
against	1
delinquent	1
members;	1
and	1
if	1
such	1
a	1
right	1
should	1
be	1
ascribed	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
head,	1
as	1
resulting	1
from	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
social	1
compact	1
between	1
the	1
States,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
by	1
inference	1
and	1
construction,	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
article,	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
declared,	1
"that	1
each	1
State	1
shall	1
retain	1
every	1
power,	1
jurisdiction,	1
and	1
right,	1
not	1
EXPRESSLY	1
delegated	1
to	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
in	1
Congress	1
assembled."	1
There	1
is,	1
doubtless,	1
a	1
striking	1
absurdity	1
in	1
supposing	1
that	1
a	1
right	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
does	1
not	1
exist,	1
but	1
we	1
are	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
dilemma	1
either	1
of	1
embracing	1
that	1
supposition,	1
preposterous	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
seem,	1
or	1
of	1
contravening	1
or	1
explaining	1
away	1
a	1
provision,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
of	1
late	1
a	1
repeated	1
theme	1
of	1
the	1
eulogies	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
oppose	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution;	1
and	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
which,	1
in	1
that	1
plan,	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
much	1
plausible	1
animadversion,	1
and	1
severe	1
criticism.	1
If	1
we	1
are	1
unwilling	1
to	1
impair	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
this	1
applauded	1
provision,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
conclude,	1
that	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
afford	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
spectacle	1
of	1
a	1
government	1
destitute	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
shadow	1
of	1
constitutional	1
power	1
to	1
enforce	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
laws.	1
It	1
will	1
appear,	1
from	1
the	1
specimens	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
cited,	1
that	1
the	1
American	1
Confederacy,	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
stands	1
discriminated	1
from	1
every	1
other	1
institution	1
of	1
a	1
similar	1
kind,	1
and	1
exhibits	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
unexampled	1
phenomenon	1
in	1
the	1
political	1
world.	1
The	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
mutual	1
guaranty	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
is	1
another	1
capital	1
imperfection	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
plan.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
declared	1
in	1
the	1
articles	1
that	1
compose	1
it;	1
and	1
to	1
imply	1
a	1
tacit	1
guaranty	1
from	1
considerations	1
of	1
utility,	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
still	1
more	1
flagrant	1
departure	1
from	1
the	1
clause	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
mentioned,	1
than	1
to	1
imply	1
a	1
tacit	1
power	1
of	1
coercion	1
from	1
the	1
like	1
considerations.	1
The	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
guaranty,	1
though	1
it	1
might	1
in	1
its	1
consequences	1
endanger	1
the	1
Union,	1
does	1
not	1
so	1
immediately	1
attack	1
its	1
existence	1
as	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
constitutional	1
sanction	1
to	1
its	1
laws.	1
Without	1
a	1
guaranty	1
the	1
assistance	1
to	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
Union	1
in	1
repelling	1
those	1
domestic	1
dangers	1
which	1
may	1
sometimes	1
threaten	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
must	1
be	1
renounced.	1
Usurpation	1
may	1
rear	1
its	1
crest	1
in	1
each	1
State,	1
and	1
trample	1
upon	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
while	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
could	1
legally	1
do	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
behold	1
its	1
encroachments	1
with	1
indignation	1
and	1
regret.	1
A	1
successful	1
faction	1
may	1
erect	1
a	1
tyranny	1
on	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
order	1
and	1
law,	1
while	1
no	1
succor	1
could	1
constitutionally	1
be	1
afforded	1
by	1
the	1
Union	1
to	1
the	1
friends	1
and	1
supporters	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
The	1
tempestuous	1
situation	1
from	1
which	1
Massachusetts	1
has	1
scarcely	1
emerged,	1
evinces	1
that	1
dangers	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
are	1
not	1
merely	1
speculative.	1
Who	1
can	1
determine	1
what	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
issue	1
of	1
her	1
late	1
convulsions,	1
if	1
the	1
malcontents	1
had	1
been	1
headed	1
by	1
a	1
Caesar	1
or	1
by	1
a	1
Cromwell?	1
Who	1
can	1
predict	1
what	1
effect	1
a	1
despotism,	1
established	1
in	1
Massachusetts,	1
would	1
have	1
upon	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
New	1
Hampshire	1
or	1
Rhode	1
Island,	1
of	1
Connecticut	1
or	1
New	1
York?	1
The	1
inordinate	1
pride	1
of	1
State	1
importance	1
has	1
suggested	1
to	1
some	1
minds	1
an	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
a	1
guaranty	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
as	1
involving	1
an	1
officious	1
interference	1
in	1
the	1
domestic	1
concerns	1
of	1
the	1
members.	1
A	1
scruple	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
would	1
deprive	1
us	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
advantages	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
from	1
union,	1
and	1
can	1
only	1
flow	1
from	1
a	1
misapprehension	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
provision	1
itself.	1
It	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
impediment	1
to	1
reforms	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
constitution	1
by	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
a	1
legal	1
and	1
peaceable	1
mode.	1
This	1
right	1
would	1
remain	1
undiminished.	1
The	1
guaranty	1
could	1
only	1
operate	1
against	1
changes	1
to	1
be	1
effected	1
by	1
violence.	1
Towards	1
the	1
preventions	1
of	1
calamities	1
of	1
this	1
kind,	1
too	1
many	1
checks	1
cannot	1
be	1
provided.	1
The	1
peace	1
of	1
society	1
and	1
the	1
stability	1
of	1
government	1
depend	1
absolutely	1
on	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
the	1
precautions	1
adopted	1
on	1
this	1
head.	1
Where	1
the	1
whole	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
less	1
pretense	1
for	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
violent	1
remedies	1
in	1
partial	1
or	1
occasional	1
distempers	1
of	1
the	1
State.	1
The	1
natural	1
cure	1
for	1
an	1
ill-administration,	1
in	1
a	1
popular	1
or	1
representative	1
constitution,	1
is	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
men.	1
A	1
guaranty	1
by	1
the	1
national	1
authority	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
levelled	1
against	1
the	1
usurpations	1
of	1
rulers	1
as	1
against	1
the	1
ferments	1
and	1
outrages	1
of	1
faction	1
and	1
sedition	1
in	1
the	1
community.	1
The	1
principle	1
of	1
regulating	1
the	1
contributions	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
to	1
the	1
common	1
treasury	1
by	1
QUOTAS	1
is	1
another	1
fundamental	1
error	1
in	1
the	1
Confederation.	1
Its	1
repugnancy	1
to	1
an	1
adequate	1
supply	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
exigencies	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
pointed	1
out,	1
and	1
has	1
sufficiently	1
appeared	1
from	1
the	1
trial	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
now	1
solely	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
equality	1
among	1
the	1
States.	1
Those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
contemplate	1
the	1
circumstances	1
which	1
produce	1
and	1
constitute	1
national	1
wealth,	1
must	1
be	1
satisfied	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
common	1
standard	1
or	1
barometer	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
degrees	1
of	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
ascertained.	1
Neither	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
lands,	1
nor	1
the	1
numbers	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
successively	1
proposed	1
as	1
the	1
rule	1
of	1
State	1
contributions,	1
has	1
any	1
pretension	1
to	1
being	1
a	1
just	1
representative.	1
If	1
we	1
compare	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
Netherlands	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
Russia	1
or	1
Germany,	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
France,	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
compare	1
the	1
total	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
lands	1
and	1
the	1
aggregate	1
population	1
of	1
that	1
contracted	1
district	1
with	1
the	1
total	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
lands	1
and	1
the	1
aggregate	1
population	1
of	1
the	1
immense	1
regions	1
of	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
last-mentioned	1
countries,	1
we	1
shall	1
at	1
once	1
discover	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
comparison	1
between	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
either	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
objects	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
relative	1
wealth	1
of	1
those	1
nations.	1
If	1
the	1
like	1
parallel	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
run	1
between	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
American	1
States,	1
it	1
would	1
furnish	1
a	1
like	1
result.	1
Let	1
Virginia	1
be	1
contrasted	1
with	1
North	1
Carolina,	1
Pennsylvania	1
with	1
Connecticut,	1
or	1
Maryland	1
with	1
New	1
Jersey,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
respective	1
abilities	1
of	1
those	1
States,	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
revenue,	1
bear	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
analogy	1
to	1
their	1
comparative	1
stock	1
in	1
lands	1
or	1
to	1
their	1
comparative	1
population.	1
The	1
position	1
may	1
be	1
equally	1
illustrated	1
by	1
a	1
similar	1
process	1
between	1
the	1
counties	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
State.	1
No	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
will	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
active	1
wealth	1
of	1
King's	1
County	1
bears	1
a	1
much	1
greater	1
proportion	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
Montgomery	1
than	1
it	1
would	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
if	1
we	1
should	1
take	1
either	1
the	1
total	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
lands	1
or	1
the	1
total	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
as	1
a	1
criterion!	1
The	1
wealth	1
of	1
nations	1
depends	1
upon	1
an	1
infinite	1
variety	1
of	1
causes.	1
Situation,	1
soil,	1
climate,	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
productions,	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
citizens,	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
information	1
they	1
possess,	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
commerce,	1
of	1
arts,	1
of	1
industry,	1
these	1
circumstances	1
and	1
many	1
more,	1
too	1
complex,	1
minute,	1
or	1
adventitious	1
to	1
admit	1
of	1
a	1
particular	1
specification,	1
occasion	1
differences	1
hardly	1
conceivable	1
in	1
the	1
relative	1
opulence	1
and	1
riches	1
of	1
different	1
countries.	1
The	1
consequence	1
clearly	1
is	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
common	1
measure	1
of	1
national	1
wealth,	1
and,	1
of	1
course,	1
no	1
general	1
or	1
stationary	1
rule	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
ability	1
of	1
a	1
state	1
to	1
pay	1
taxes	1
can	1
be	1
determined.	1
The	1
attempt,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
contributions	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
a	1
confederacy	1
by	1
any	1
such	1
rule,	1
cannot	1
fail	1
to	1
be	1
productive	1
of	1
glaring	1
inequality	1
and	1
extreme	1
oppression.	1
This	1
inequality	1
would	1
of	1
itself	1
be	1
sufficient	1
in	1
America	1
to	1
work	1
the	1
eventual	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
if	1
any	1
mode	1
of	1
enforcing	1
a	1
compliance	1
with	1
its	1
requisitions	1
could	1
be	1
devised.	1
The	1
suffering	1
States	1
would	1
not	1
long	1
consent	1
to	1
remain	1
associated	1
upon	1
a	1
principle	1
which	1
distributes	1
the	1
public	1
burdens	1
with	1
so	1
unequal	1
a	1
hand,	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
calculated	1
to	1
impoverish	1
and	1
oppress	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
some	1
States,	1
while	1
those	1
of	1
others	1
would	1
scarcely	1
be	1
conscious	1
of	1
the	1
small	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
weight	1
they	1
were	1
required	1
to	1
sustain.	1
This,	1
however,	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
inseparable	1
from	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
quotas	1
and	1
requisitions.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
method	1
of	1
steering	1
clear	1
of	1
this	1
inconvenience,	1
but	1
by	1
authorizing	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
to	1
raise	1
its	1
own	1
revenues	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
way.	1
Imposts,	1
excises,	1
and,	1
in	1
general,	1
all	1
duties	1
upon	1
articles	1
of	1
consumption,	1
may	1
be	1
compared	1
to	1
a	1
fluid,	1
which	1
will,	1
in	1
time,	1
find	1
its	1
level	1
with	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
paying	1
them.	1
The	1
amount	1
to	1
be	1
contributed	1
by	1
each	1
citizen	1
will	1
in	1
a	1
degree	1
be	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
option,	1
and	1
can	1
be	1
regulated	1
by	1
an	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
resources.	1
The	1
rich	1
may	1
be	1
extravagant,	1
the	1
poor	1
can	1
be	1
frugal;	1
and	1
private	1
oppression	1
may	1
always	1
be	1
avoided	1
by	1
a	1
judicious	1
selection	1
of	1
objects	1
proper	1
for	1
such	1
impositions.	1
If	1
inequalities	1
should	1
arise	1
in	1
some	1
States	1
from	1
duties	1
on	1
particular	1
objects,	1
these	1
will,	1
in	1
all	1
probability,	1
be	1
counterbalanced	1
by	1
proportional	1
inequalities	1
in	1
other	1
States,	1
from	1
the	1
duties	1
on	1
other	1
objects.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
things,	1
an	1
equilibrium,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
attainable	1
in	1
so	1
complicated	1
a	1
subject,	1
will	1
be	1
established	1
everywhere.	1
Or,	1
if	1
inequalities	1
should	1
still	1
exist,	1
they	1
would	1
neither	1
be	1
so	1
great	1
in	1
their	1
degree,	1
so	1
uniform	1
in	1
their	1
operation,	1
nor	1
so	1
odious	1
in	1
their	1
appearance,	1
as	1
those	1
which	1
would	1
necessarily	1
spring	1
from	1
quotas,	1
upon	1
any	1
scale	1
that	1
can	1
possibly	1
be	1
devised.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
signal	1
advantage	1
of	1
taxes	1
on	1
articles	1
of	1
consumption,	1
that	1
they	1
contain	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
nature	1
a	1
security	1
against	1
excess.	1
They	1
prescribe	1
their	1
own	1
limit;	1
which	1
cannot	1
be	1
exceeded	1
without	1
defeating	1
the	1
end	1
proposed,	1
that	1
is,	1
an	1
extension	1
of	1
the	1
revenue.	1
When	1
applied	1
to	1
this	1
object,	1
the	1
saying	1
is	1
as	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
witty,	1
that,	1
"in	1
political	1
arithmetic,	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
do	1
not	1
always	1
make	1
four."	1
If	1
duties	1
are	1
too	1
high,	1
they	1
lessen	1
the	1
consumption;	1
the	1
collection	1
is	1
eluded;	1
and	1
the	1
product	1
to	1
the	1
treasury	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
great	1
as	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
confined	1
within	1
proper	1
and	1
moderate	1
bounds.	1
This	1
forms	1
a	1
complete	1
barrier	1
against	1
any	1
material	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
by	1
taxes	1
of	1
this	1
class,	1
and	1
is	1
itself	1
a	1
natural	1
limitation	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
imposing	1
them.	1
Impositions	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
usually	1
fall	1
under	1
the	1
denomination	1
of	1
indirect	1
taxes,	1
and	1
must	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
constitute	1
the	1
chief	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
revenue	1
raised	1
in	1
this	1
country.	1
Those	1
of	1
the	1
direct	1
kind,	1
which	1
principally	1
relate	1
to	1
land	1
and	1
buildings,	1
may	1
admit	1
of	1
a	1
rule	1
of	1
apportionment.	1
Either	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
land,	1
or	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
may	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
standard.	1
The	1
state	1
of	1
agriculture	1
and	1
the	1
populousness	1
of	1
a	1
country	1
have	1
been	1
considered	1
as	1
nearly	1
connected	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
And,	1
as	1
a	1
rule,	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
intended,	1
numbers,	1
in	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
simplicity	1
and	1
certainty,	1
are	1
entitled	1
to	1
a	1
preference.	1
In	1
every	1
country	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
herculean	1
task	1
to	1
obtain	1
a	1
valuation	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
imperfectly	1
settled	1
and	1
progressive	1
in	1
improvement,	1
the	1
difficulties	1
are	1
increased	1
almost	1
to	1
impracticability.	1
The	1
expense	1
of	1
an	1
accurate	1
valuation	1
is,	1
in	1
all	1
situations,	1
a	1
formidable	1
objection.	1
In	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
taxation	1
where	1
no	1
limits	1
to	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
things,	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
a	1
fixed	1
rule,	1
not	1
incompatible	1
with	1
the	1
end,	1
may	1
be	1
attended	1
with	1
fewer	1
inconveniences	1
than	1
to	1
leave	1
that	1
discretion	1
altogether	1
at	1
large.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
IN	1
ADDITION	1
to	1
the	1
defects	1
already	1
enumerated	1
in	1
the	1
existing	1
federal	1
system,	1
there	1
are	1
others	1
of	1
not	1
less	1
importance,	1
which	1
concur	1
in	1
rendering	1
it	1
altogether	1
unfit	1
for	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
The	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
power	1
to	1
regulate	1
commerce	1
is	1
by	1
all	1
parties	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
number.	1
The	1
utility	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
power	1
has	1
been	1
anticipated	1
under	1
the	1
first	1
head	1
of	1
our	1
inquiries;	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
reason,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
universal	1
conviction	1
entertained	1
upon	1
the	1
subject,	1
little	1
need	1
be	1
added	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
It	1
is	1
indeed	1
evident,	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
superficial	1
view,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
object,	1
either	1
as	1
it	1
respects	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
trade	1
or	1
finance,	1
that	1
more	1
strongly	1
demands	1
a	1
federal	1
superintendence.	1
The	1
want	1
of	1
it	1
has	1
already	1
operated	1
as	1
a	1
bar	1
to	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
beneficial	1
treaties	1
with	1
foreign	1
powers,	1
and	1
has	1
given	1
occasions	1
of	1
dissatisfaction	1
between	1
the	1
States.	1
No	1
nation	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
our	1
political	1
association	1
would	1
be	1
unwise	1
enough	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
stipulations	1
with	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
conceded	1
privileges	1
of	1
any	1
importance	1
to	1
them,	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
apprised	1
that	1
the	1
engagements	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
might	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
be	1
violated	1
by	1
its	1
members,	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
found	1
from	1
experience	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
enjoy	1
every	1
advantage	1
they	1
desired	1
in	1
our	1
markets,	1
without	1
granting	1
us	1
any	1
return	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
their	1
momentary	1
convenience	1
might	1
suggest.	1
It	1
is	1
not,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
be	1
wondered	1
at	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Jenkinson,	1
in	1
ushering	1
into	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Commons	1
a	1
bill	1
for	1
regulating	1
the	1
temporary	1
intercourse	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
countries,	1
should	1
preface	1
its	1
introduction	1
by	1
a	1
declaration	1
that	1
similar	1
provisions	1
in	1
former	1
bills	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
to	1
answer	1
every	1
purpose	1
to	1
the	1
commerce	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
prudent	1
to	1
persist	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
until	1
it	1
should	1
appear	1
whether	1
the	1
American	1
government	1
was	1
likely	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
acquire	1
greater	1
consistency.	1
[1]	1
Several	1
States	1
have	1
endeavored,	1
by	1
separate	1
prohibitions,	1
restrictions,	1
and	1
exclusions,	1
to	1
influence	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
that	1
kingdom	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
but	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
concert,	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
authority	1
and	1
from	1
clashing	1
and	1
dissimilar	1
views	1
in	1
the	1
State,	1
has	1
hitherto	1
frustrated	1
every	1
experiment	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
and	1
will	1
continue	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
same	1
obstacles	1
to	1
a	1
uniformity	1
of	1
measures	1
continue	1
to	1
exist.	1
The	1
interfering	1
and	1
unneighborly	1
regulations	1
of	1
some	1
States,	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
true	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
have,	1
in	1
different	1
instances,	1
given	1
just	1
cause	1
of	1
umbrage	1
and	1
complaint	1
to	1
others,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
feared	1
that	1
examples	1
of	1
this	1
nature,	1
if	1
not	1
restrained	1
by	1
a	1
national	1
control,	1
would	1
be	1
multiplied	1
and	1
extended	1
till	1
they	1
became	1
not	1
less	1
serious	1
sources	1
of	1
animosity	1
and	1
discord	1
than	1
injurious	1
impediments	1
to	1
the	1
intercourse	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy.	1
"The	1
commerce	1
of	1
the	1
German	1
empire	1
[2]	1
is	1
in	1
continual	1
trammels	1
from	1
the	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
the	1
duties	1
which	1
the	1
several	1
princes	1
and	1
states	1
exact	1
upon	1
the	1
merchandises	1
passing	1
through	1
their	1
territories,	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
fine	1
streams	1
and	1
navigable	1
rivers	1
with	1
which	1
Germany	1
is	1
so	1
happily	1
watered	1
are	1
rendered	1
almost	1
useless."	1
Though	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
this	1
country	1
might	1
never	1
permit	1
this	1
description	1
to	1
be	1
strictly	1
applicable	1
to	1
us,	1
yet	1
we	1
may	1
reasonably	1
expect,	1
from	1
the	1
gradual	1
conflicts	1
of	1
State	1
regulations,	1
that	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
each	1
would	1
at	1
length	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
and	1
treated	1
by	1
the	1
others	1
in	1
no	1
better	1
light	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
foreigners	1
and	1
aliens.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
raising	1
armies,	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
obvious	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation,	1
is	1
merely	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
requisitions	1
upon	1
the	1
States	1
for	1
quotas	1
of	1
men.	1
This	1
practice	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
war,	1
was	1
found	1
replete	1
with	1
obstructions	1
to	1
a	1
vigorous	1
and	1
to	1
an	1
economical	1
system	1
of	1
defense.	1
It	1
gave	1
birth	1
to	1
a	1
competition	1
between	1
the	1
States	1
which	1
created	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
auction	1
for	1
men.	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
furnish	1
the	1
quotas	1
required	1
of	1
them,	1
they	1
outbid	1
each	1
other	1
till	1
bounties	1
grew	1
to	1
an	1
enormous	1
and	1
insupportable	1
size.	1
The	1
hope	1
of	1
a	1
still	1
further	1
increase	1
afforded	1
an	1
inducement	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
disposed	1
to	1
serve	1
to	1
procrastinate	1
their	1
enlistment,	1
and	1
disinclined	1
them	1
from	1
engaging	1
for	1
any	1
considerable	1
periods.	1
Hence,	1
slow	1
and	1
scanty	1
levies	1
of	1
men,	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
critical	1
emergencies	1
of	1
our	1
affairs;	1
short	1
enlistments	1
at	1
an	1
unparalleled	1
expense;	1
continual	1
fluctuations	1
in	1
the	1
troops,	1
ruinous	1
to	1
their	1
discipline	1
and	1
subjecting	1
the	1
public	1
safety	1
frequently	1
to	1
the	1
perilous	1
crisis	1
of	1
a	1
disbanded	1
army.	1
Hence,	1
also,	1
those	1
oppressive	1
expedients	1
for	1
raising	1
men	1
which	1
were	1
upon	1
several	1
occasions	1
practiced,	1
and	1
which	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
enthusiasm	1
of	1
liberty	1
would	1
have	1
induced	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
endure.	1
This	1
method	1
of	1
raising	1
troops	1
is	1
not	1
more	1
unfriendly	1
to	1
economy	1
and	1
vigor	1
than	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
an	1
equal	1
distribution	1
of	1
the	1
burden.	1
The	1
States	1
near	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
war,	1
influenced	1
by	1
motives	1
of	1
self-preservation,	1
made	1
efforts	1
to	1
furnish	1
their	1
quotas,	1
which	1
even	1
exceeded	1
their	1
abilities;	1
while	1
those	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
from	1
danger	1
were,	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part,	1
as	1
remiss	1
as	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
diligent,	1
in	1
their	1
exertions.	1
The	1
immediate	1
pressure	1
of	1
this	1
inequality	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
as	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
contributions	1
of	1
money,	1
alleviated	1
by	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
a	1
final	1
liquidation.	1
The	1
States	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
pay	1
their	1
proportions	1
of	1
money	1
might	1
at	1
least	1
be	1
charged	1
with	1
their	1
deficiencies;	1
but	1
no	1
account	1
could	1
be	1
formed	1
of	1
the	1
deficiencies	1
in	1
the	1
supplies	1
of	1
men.	1
We	1
shall	1
not,	1
however,	1
see	1
much	1
reason	1
to	1
reget	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
this	1
hope,	1
when	1
we	1
consider	1
how	1
little	1
prospect	1
there	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
delinquent	1
States	1
will	1
ever	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
compensation	1
for	1
their	1
pecuniary	1
failures.	1
The	1
system	1
of	1
quotas	1
and	1
requisitions,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
applied	1
to	1
men	1
or	1
money,	1
is,	1
in	1
every	1
view,	1
a	1
system	1
of	1
imbecility	1
in	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
of	1
inequality	1
and	1
injustice	1
among	1
the	1
members.	1
The	1
right	1
of	1
equal	1
suffrage	1
among	1
the	1
States	1
is	1
another	1
exceptionable	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation.	1
Every	1
idea	1
of	1
proportion	1
and	1
every	1
rule	1
of	1
fair	1
representation	1
conspire	1
to	1
condemn	1
a	1
principle,	1
which	1
gives	1
to	1
Rhode	1
Island	1
an	1
equal	1
weight	1
in	1
the	1
scale	1
of	1
power	1
with	1
Massachusetts,	1
or	1
Connecticut,	1
or	1
New	1
York;	1
and	1
to	1
Deleware	1
an	1
equal	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
deliberations	1
with	1
Pennsylvania,	1
or	1
Virginia,	1
or	1
North	1
Carolina.	1
Its	1
operation	1
contradicts	1
the	1
fundamental	1
maxim	1
of	1
republican	1
government,	1
which	1
requires	1
that	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
majority	1
should	1
prevail.	1
Sophistry	1
may	1
reply,	1
that	1
sovereigns	1
are	1
equal,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
votes	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
confederated	1
America.	1
But	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
logical	1
legerdemain	1
will	1
never	1
counteract	1
the	1
plain	1
suggestions	1
of	1
justice	1
and	1
common-sense.	1
It	1
may	1
happen	1
that	1
this	1
majority	1
of	1
States	1
is	1
a	1
small	1
minority	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
[3];	1
and	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
could	1
not	1
long	1
be	1
persuaded,	1
upon	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
artificial	1
distinctions	1
and	1
syllogistic	1
subtleties,	1
to	1
submit	1
their	1
interests	1
to	1
the	1
management	1
and	1
disposal	1
of	1
one	1
third.	1
The	1
larger	1
States	1
would	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
revolt	1
from	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
receiving	1
the	1
law	1
from	1
the	1
smaller.	1
To	1
acquiesce	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
privation	1
of	1
their	1
due	1
importance	1
in	1
the	1
political	1
scale,	1
would	1
be	1
not	1
merely	1
to	1
be	1
insensible	1
to	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
power,	1
but	1
even	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
equality.	1
It	1
is	1
neither	1
rational	1
to	1
expect	1
the	1
first,	1
nor	1
just	1
to	1
require	1
the	1
last.	1
The	1
smaller	1
States,	1
considering	1
how	1
peculiarly	1
their	1
safety	1
and	1
welfare	1
depend	1
on	1
union,	1
ought	1
readily	1
to	1
renounce	1
a	1
pretension	1
which,	1
if	1
not	1
relinquished,	1
would	1
prove	1
fatal	1
to	1
its	1
duration.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
objected	1
to	1
this,	1
that	1
not	1
seven	1
but	1
nine	1
States,	1
or	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
number,	1
must	1
consent	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
resolutions;	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
thence	1
inferred	1
that	1
nine	1
States	1
would	1
always	1
comprehend	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
But	1
this	1
does	1
not	1
obviate	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
an	1
equal	1
vote	1
between	1
States	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
unequal	1
dimensions	1
and	1
populousness;	1
nor	1
is	1
the	1
inference	1
accurate	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
fact;	1
for	1
we	1
can	1
enumerate	1
nine	1
States	1
which	1
contain	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
[4];	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
constitutionally	1
possible	1
that	1
these	1
nine	1
may	1
give	1
the	1
vote.	1
Besides,	1
there	1
are	1
matters	1
of	1
considerable	1
moment	1
determinable	1
by	1
a	1
bare	1
majority;	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
others,	1
concerning	1
which	1
doubts	1
have	1
been	1
entertained,	1
which,	1
if	1
interpreted	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
sufficiency	1
of	1
a	1
vote	1
of	1
seven	1
States,	1
would	1
extend	1
its	1
operation	1
to	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
magnitude.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
this,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
probability	1
of	1
an	1
increase	1
in	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
States,	1
and	1
no	1
provision	1
for	1
a	1
proportional	1
augmentation	1
of	1
the	1
ratio	1
of	1
votes.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all:	1
what	1
at	1
first	1
sight	1
may	1
seem	1
a	1
remedy,	1
is,	1
in	1
reality,	1
a	1
poison.	1
To	1
give	1
a	1
minority	1
a	1
negative	1
upon	1
the	1
majority	1
(which	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
case	1
where	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
majority	1
is	1
requisite	1
to	1
a	1
decision),	1
is,	1
in	1
its	1
tendency,	1
to	1
subject	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
greater	1
number	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
lesser.	1
Congress,	1
from	1
the	1
nonattendance	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
States,	1
have	1
been	1
frequently	1
in	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
a	1
Polish	1
diet,	1
where	1
a	1
single	1
VOTE	1
has	1
been	1
sufficient	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
all	1
their	1
movements.	1
A	1
sixtieth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
which	1
is	1
about	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
Delaware	1
and	1
Rhode	1
Island,	1
has	1
several	1
times	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
oppose	1
an	1
entire	1
bar	1
to	1
its	1
operations.	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
refinements	1
which,	1
in	1
practice,	1
has	1
an	1
effect	1
the	1
reverse	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
expected	1
from	1
it	1
in	1
theory.	1
The	1
necessity	1
of	1
unanimity	1
in	1
public	1
bodies,	1
or	1
of	1
something	1
approaching	1
towards	1
it,	1
has	1
been	1
founded	1
upon	1
a	1
supposition	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
contribute	1
to	1
security.	1
But	1
its	1
real	1
operation	1
is	1
to	1
embarrass	1
the	1
administration,	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
to	1
substitute	1
the	1
pleasure,	1
caprice,	1
or	1
artifices	1
of	1
an	1
insignificant,	1
turbulent,	1
or	1
corrupt	1
junto,	1
to	1
the	1
regular	1
deliberations	1
and	1
decisions	1
of	1
a	1
respectable	1
majority.	1
In	1
those	1
emergencies	1
of	1
a	1
nation,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
goodness	1
or	1
badness,	1
the	1
weakness	1
or	1
strength	1
of	1
its	1
government,	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
importance,	1
there	1
is	1
commonly	1
a	1
necessity	1
for	1
action.	1
The	1
public	1
business	1
must,	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
or	1
other,	1
go	1
forward.	1
If	1
a	1
pertinacious	1
minority	1
can	1
control	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
a	1
majority,	1
respecting	1
the	1
best	1
mode	1
of	1
conducting	1
it,	1
the	1
majority,	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
something	1
may	1
be	1
done,	1
must	1
conform	1
to	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
minority;	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
smaller	1
number	1
will	1
overrule	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
greater,	1
and	1
give	1
a	1
tone	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
proceedings.	1
Hence,	1
tedious	1
delays;	1
continual	1
negotiation	1
and	1
intrigue;	1
contemptible	1
compromises	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
good.	1
And	1
yet,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
system,	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
happy	1
when	1
such	1
compromises	1
can	1
take	1
place:	1
for	1
upon	1
some	1
occasions	1
things	1
will	1
not	1
admit	1
of	1
accommodation;	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
measures	1
of	1
government	1
must	1
be	1
injuriously	1
suspended,	1
or	1
fatally	1
defeated.	1
It	1
is	1
often,	1
by	1
the	1
impracticability	1
of	1
obtaining	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
the	1
necessary	1
number	1
of	1
votes,	1
kept	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
inaction.	1
Its	1
situation	1
must	1
always	1
savor	1
of	1
weakness,	1
sometimes	1
border	1
upon	1
anarchy.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
difficult	1
to	1
discover,	1
that	1
a	1
principle	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
gives	1
greater	1
scope	1
to	1
foreign	1
corruption,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
domestic	1
faction,	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
permits	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
majority	1
to	1
decide;	1
though	1
the	1
contrary	1
of	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
presumed.	1
The	1
mistake	1
has	1
proceeded	1
from	1
not	1
attending	1
with	1
due	1
care	1
to	1
the	1
mischiefs	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
occasioned	1
by	1
obstructing	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
government	1
at	1
certain	1
critical	1
seasons.	1
When	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
is	1
required	1
by	1
the	1
Constitution	1
to	1
the	1
doing	1
of	1
any	1
national	1
act,	1
we	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
rest	1
satisfied	1
that	1
all	1
is	1
safe,	1
because	1
nothing	1
improper	1
will	1
be	1
likely	1
TO	1
BE	1
DONE,	1
but	1
we	1
forget	1
how	1
much	1
good	1
may	1
be	1
prevented,	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
ill	1
may	1
be	1
produced,	1
by	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
hindering	1
the	1
doing	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
necessary,	1
and	1
of	1
keeping	1
affairs	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
unfavorable	1
posture	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
stand	1
at	1
particular	1
periods.	1
Suppose,	1
for	1
instance,	1
we	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
a	1
war,	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
one	1
foreign	1
nation,	1
against	1
another.	1
Suppose	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
our	1
situation	1
demanded	1
peace,	1
and	1
the	1
interest	1
or	1
ambition	1
of	1
our	1
ally	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
prosecution	1
of	1
the	1
war,	1
with	1
views	1
that	1
might	1
justify	1
us	1
in	1
making	1
separate	1
terms.	1
In	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
things,	1
this	1
ally	1
of	1
ours	1
would	1
evidently	1
find	1
it	1
much	1
easier,	1
by	1
his	1
bribes	1
and	1
intrigues,	1
to	1
tie	1
up	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
government	1
from	1
making	1
peace,	1
where	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
votes	1
were	1
requisite	1
to	1
that	1
object,	1
than	1
where	1
a	1
simple	1
majority	1
would	1
suffice.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
case,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
corrupt	1
a	1
smaller	1
number;	1
in	1
the	1
last,	1
a	1
greater	1
number.	1
Upon	1
the	1
same	1
principle,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
much	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
foreign	1
power	1
with	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
war	1
to	1
perplex	1
our	1
councils	1
and	1
embarrass	1
our	1
exertions.	1
And,	1
in	1
a	1
commercial	1
view,	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
subjected	1
to	1
similar	1
inconveniences.	1
A	1
nation,	1
with	1
which	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
a	1
treaty	1
of	1
commerce,	1
could	1
with	1
much	1
greater	1
facility	1
prevent	1
our	1
forming	1
a	1
connection	1
with	1
her	1
competitor	1
in	1
trade,	1
though	1
such	1
a	1
connection	1
should	1
be	1
ever	1
so	1
beneficial	1
to	1
ourselves.	1
Evils	1
of	1
this	1
description	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
imaginary.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
weak	1
sides	1
of	1
republics,	1
among	1
their	1
numerous	1
advantages,	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
afford	1
too	1
easy	1
an	1
inlet	1
to	1
foreign	1
corruption.	1
An	1
hereditary	1
monarch,	1
though	1
often	1
disposed	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
his	1
subjects	1
to	1
his	1
ambition,	1
has	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
personal	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
external	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
easy	1
for	1
a	1
foreign	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
equivalent	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
sacrifice	1
by	1
treachery	1
to	1
the	1
state.	1
The	1
world	1
has	1
accordingly	1
been	1
witness	1
to	1
few	1
examples	1
of	1
this	1
species	1
of	1
royal	1
prostitution,	1
though	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
abundant	1
specimens	1
of	1
every	1
other	1
kind.	1
In	1
republics,	1
persons	1
elevated	1
from	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
community,	1
by	1
the	1
suffrages	1
of	1
their	1
fellow-citizens,	1
to	1
stations	1
of	1
great	1
pre-eminence	1
and	1
power,	1
may	1
find	1
compensations	1
for	1
betraying	1
their	1
trust,	1
which,	1
to	1
any	1
but	1
minds	1
animated	1
and	1
guided	1
by	1
superior	1
virtue,	1
may	1
appear	1
to	1
exceed	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
interest	1
they	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
stock,	1
and	1
to	1
overbalance	1
the	1
obligations	1
of	1
duty.	1
Hence	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
history	1
furnishes	1
us	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
mortifying	1
examples	1
of	1
the	1
prevalency	1
of	1
foreign	1
corruption	1
in	1
republican	1
governments.	1
How	1
much	1
this	1
contributed	1
to	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
commonwealths	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
delineated.	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
deputies	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
Provinces	1
have,	1
in	1
various	1
instances,	1
been	1
purchased	1
by	1
the	1
emissaries	1
of	1
the	1
neighboring	1
kingdoms.	1
The	1
Earl	1
of	1
Chesterfield	1
(if	1
my	1
memory	1
serves	1
me	1
right),	1
in	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
his	1
court,	1
intimates	1
that	1
his	1
success	1
in	1
an	1
important	1
negotiation	1
must	1
depend	1
on	1
his	1
obtaining	1
a	1
major's	1
commission	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
deputies.	1
And	1
in	1
Sweden	1
the	1
parties	1
were	1
alternately	1
bought	1
by	1
France	1
and	1
England	1
in	1
so	1
barefaced	1
and	1
notorious	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
it	1
excited	1
universal	1
disgust	1
in	1
the	1
nation,	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
principal	1
cause	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
limited	1
monarch	1
in	1
Europe,	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
day,	1
without	1
tumult,	1
violence,	1
or	1
opposition,	1
became	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
absolute	1
and	1
uncontrolled.	1
A	1
circumstance	1
which	1
crowns	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation	1
remains	1
yet	1
to	1
be	1
mentioned,	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
judiciary	1
power.	1
Laws	1
are	1
a	1
dead	1
letter	1
without	1
courts	1
to	1
expound	1
and	1
define	1
their	1
true	1
meaning	1
and	1
operation.	1
The	1
treaties	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
force	1
at	1
all,	1
must	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
Their	1
true	1
import,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
respects	1
individuals,	1
must,	1
like	1
all	1
other	1
laws,	1
be	1
ascertained	1
by	1
judicial	1
determinations.	1
To	1
produce	1
uniformity	1
in	1
these	1
determinations,	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
submitted,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
resort,	1
to	1
one	1
SUPREME	1
TRIBUNAL.	1
And	1
this	1
tribunal	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
instituted	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
authority	1
which	1
forms	1
the	1
treaties	1
themselves.	1
These	1
ingredients	1
are	1
both	1
indispensable.	1
If	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
each	1
State	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
final	1
jurisdiction,	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
many	1
different	1
final	1
determinations	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
point	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
courts.	1
There	1
are	1
endless	1
diversities	1
in	1
the	1
opinions	1
of	1
men.	1
We	1
often	1
see	1
not	1
only	1
different	1
courts	1
but	1
the	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
came	1
court	1
differing	1
from	1
each	1
other.	1
To	1
avoid	1
the	1
confusion	1
which	1
would	1
unavoidably	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
contradictory	1
decisions	1
of	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
independent	1
judicatories,	1
all	1
nations	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
establish	1
one	1
court	1
paramount	1
to	1
the	1
rest,	1
possessing	1
a	1
general	1
superintendence,	1
and	1
authorized	1
to	1
settle	1
and	1
declare	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
resort	1
a	1
uniform	1
rule	1
of	1
civil	1
justice.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
necessary	1
where	1
the	1
frame	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
is	1
so	1
compounded	1
that	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
are	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
contravened	1
by	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
parts.	1
In	1
this	1
case,	1
if	1
the	1
particular	1
tribunals	1
are	1
invested	1
with	1
a	1
right	1
of	1
ultimate	1
jurisdiction,	1
besides	1
the	1
contradictions	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
from	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
to	1
fear	1
from	1
the	1
bias	1
of	1
local	1
views	1
and	1
prejudices,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
interference	1
of	1
local	1
regulations.	1
As	1
often	1
as	1
such	1
an	1
interference	1
was	1
to	1
happen,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
reason	1
to	1
apprehend	1
that	1
the	1
provisions	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
laws	1
might	1
be	1
preferred	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
laws;	1
for	1
nothing	1
is	1
more	1
natural	1
to	1
men	1
in	1
office	1
than	1
to	1
look	1
with	1
peculiar	1
deference	1
towards	1
that	1
authority	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
owe	1
their	1
official	1
existence.	1
The	1
treaties	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
under	1
the	1
present	1
Constitution,	1
are	1
liable	1
to	1
the	1
infractions	1
of	1
thirteen	1
different	1
legislatures,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
different	1
courts	1
of	1
final	1
jurisdiction,	1
acting	1
under	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
those	1
legislatures.	1
The	1
faith,	1
the	1
reputation,	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
Union,	1
are	1
thus	1
continually	1
at	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
prejudices,	1
the	1
passions,	1
and	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
every	1
member	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
composed.	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
foreign	1
nations	1
can	1
either	1
respect	1
or	1
confide	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
government?	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
will	1
longer	1
consent	1
to	1
trust	1
their	1
honor,	1
their	1
happiness,	1
their	1
safety,	1
on	1
so	1
precarious	1
a	1
foundation?	1
In	1
this	1
review	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation,	1
I	1
have	1
confined	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
exhibition	1
of	1
its	1
most	1
material	1
defects;	1
passing	1
over	1
those	1
imperfections	1
in	1
its	1
details	1
by	1
which	1
even	1
a	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
conferred	1
upon	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure	1
rendered	1
abortive.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
evident	1
to	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
reflection,	1
who	1
can	1
divest	1
themselves	1
of	1
the	1
prepossessions	1
of	1
preconceived	1
opinions,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
system	1
so	1
radically	1
vicious	1
and	1
unsound,	1
as	1
to	1
admit	1
not	1
of	1
amendment	1
but	1
by	1
an	1
entire	1
change	1
in	1
its	1
leading	1
features	1
and	1
characters.	1
The	1
organization	1
of	1
Congress	1
is	1
itself	1
utterly	1
improper	1
for	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
those	1
powers	1
which	1
are	1
necessary	1
to	1
be	1
deposited	1
in	1
the	1
Union.	1
A	1
single	1
assembly	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
proper	1
receptacle	1
of	1
those	1
slender,	1
or	1
rather	1
fettered,	1
authorities,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
heretofore	1
delegated	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
head;	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
good	1
government,	1
to	1
intrust	1
it	1
with	1
those	1
additional	1
powers	1
which,	1
even	1
the	1
moderate	1
and	1
more	1
rational	1
adversaries	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
admit,	1
ought	1
to	1
reside	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
If	1
that	1
plan	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
adopted,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
withstand	1
the	1
ambitious	1
aims	1
of	1
those	1
men	1
who	1
may	1
indulge	1
magnificent	1
schemes	1
of	1
personal	1
aggrandizement	1
from	1
its	1
dissolution,	1
the	1
probability	1
would	1
be,	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
run	1
into	1
the	1
project	1
of	1
conferring	1
supplementary	1
powers	1
upon	1
Congress,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
now	1
constituted;	1
and	1
either	1
the	1
machine,	1
from	1
the	1
intrinsic	1
feebleness	1
of	1
its	1
structure,	1
will	1
moulder	1
into	1
pieces,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
our	1
ill-judged	1
efforts	1
to	1
prop	1
it;	1
or,	1
by	1
successive	1
augmentations	1
of	1
its	1
force	1
an	1
energy,	1
as	1
necessity	1
might	1
prompt,	1
we	1
shall	1
finally	1
accumulate,	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
body,	1
all	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
prerogatives	1
of	1
sovereignty,	1
and	1
thus	1
entail	1
upon	1
our	1
posterity	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
execrable	1
forms	1
of	1
government	1
that	1
human	1
infatuation	1
ever	1
contrived.	1
Thus,	1
we	1
should	1
create	1
in	1
reality	1
that	1
very	1
tyranny	1
which	1
the	1
adversaries	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution	1
either	1
are,	1
or	1
affect	1
to	1
be,	1
solicitous	1
to	1
avert.	1
It	1
has	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
contributed	1
to	1
the	1
infirmities	1
of	1
the	1
existing	1
federal	1
system,	1
that	1
it	1
never	1
had	1
a	1
ratification	1
by	1
the	1
PEOPLE.	1
Resting	1
on	1
no	1
better	1
foundation	1
than	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
legislatures,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
exposed	1
to	1
frequent	1
and	1
intricate	1
questions	1
concerning	1
the	1
validity	1
of	1
its	1
powers,	1
and	1
has,	1
in	1
some	1
instances,	1
given	1
birth	1
to	1
the	1
enormous	1
doctrine	1
of	1
a	1
right	1
of	1
legislative	1
repeal.	1
Owing	1
its	1
ratification	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
a	1
State,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
contended	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
authority	1
might	1
repeal	1
the	1
law	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
ratified.	1
However	1
gross	1
a	1
heresy	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
maintain	1
that	1
a	1
PARTY	1
to	1
a	1
COMPACT	1
has	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
revoke	1
that	1
COMPACT,	1
the	1
doctrine	1
itself	1
has	1
had	1
respectable	1
advocates.	1
The	1
possibility	1
of	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
this	1
nature	1
proves	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
laying	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
our	1
national	1
government	1
deeper	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
mere	1
sanction	1
of	1
delegated	1
authority.	1
The	1
fabric	1
of	1
American	1
empire	1
ought	1
to	1
rest	1
on	1
the	1
solid	1
basis	1
of	1
THE	1
CONSENT	1
OF	1
THE	1
PEOPLE.	1
The	1
streams	1
of	1
national	1
power	1
ought	1
to	1
flow	1
immediately	1
from	1
that	1
pure,	1
original	1
fountain	1
of	1
all	1
legitimate	1
authority.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
Constitution,	1
at	1
least	1
equally	1
energetic	1
with	1
the	1
one	1
proposed,	1
to	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
is	1
the	1
point	1
at	1
the	1
examination	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
now	1
arrived.	1
This	1
inquiry	1
will	1
naturally	1
divide	1
itself	1
into	1
three	1
branches	1
the	1
objects	1
to	1
be	1
provided	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
power	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
those	1
objects,	1
the	1
persons	1
upon	1
whom	1
that	1
power	1
ought	1
to	1
operate.	1
Its	1
distribution	1
and	1
organization	1
will	1
more	1
properly	1
claim	1
our	1
attention	1
under	1
the	1
succeeding	1
head.	1
The	1
principal	1
purposes	1
to	1
be	1
answered	1
by	1
union	1
are	1
these	1
the	1
common	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
members;	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
peace	1
as	1
well	1
against	1
internal	1
convulsions	1
as	1
external	1
attacks;	1
the	1
regulation	1
of	1
commerce	1
with	1
other	1
nations	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
States;	1
the	1
superintendence	1
of	1
our	1
intercourse,	1
political	1
and	1
commercial,	1
with	1
foreign	1
countries.	1
The	1
authorities	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
common	1
defense	1
are	1
these:	1
to	1
raise	1
armies;	1
to	1
build	1
and	1
equip	1
fleets;	1
to	1
prescribe	1
rules	1
for	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
both;	1
to	1
direct	1
their	1
operations;	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
their	1
support.	1
These	1
powers	1
ought	1
to	1
exist	1
without	1
limitation,	1
BECAUSE	1
IT	1
IS	1
IMPOSSIBLE	1
TO	1
FORESEE	1
OR	1
DEFINE	1
THE	1
EXTENT	1
AND	1
VARIETY	1
OF	1
NATIONAL	1
EXIGENCIES,	1
OR	1
THE	1
CORRESPONDENT	1
EXTENT	1
AND	1
VARIETY	1
OF	1
THE	1
MEANS	1
WHICH	1
MAY	1
BE	1
NECESSARY	1
TO	1
SATISFY	1
THEM.	1
The	1
circumstances	1
that	1
endanger	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
nations	1
are	1
infinite,	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
reason	1
no	1
constitutional	1
shackles	1
can	1
wisely	1
be	1
imposed	1
on	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
committed.	1
This	1
power	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
coextensive	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
possible	1
combinations	1
of	1
such	1
circumstances;	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
councils	1
which	1
are	1
appointed	1
to	1
preside	1
over	1
the	1
common	1
defense.	1
This	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
truths	1
which,	1
to	1
a	1
correct	1
and	1
unprejudiced	1
mind,	1
carries	1
its	1
own	1
evidence	1
along	1
with	1
it;	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
obscured,	1
but	1
cannot	1
be	1
made	1
plainer	1
by	1
argument	1
or	1
reasoning.	1
It	1
rests	1
upon	1
axioms	1
as	1
simple	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
universal;	1
the	1
MEANS	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
proportioned	1
to	1
the	1
END;	1
the	1
persons,	1
from	1
whose	1
agency	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
any	1
END	1
is	1
expected,	1
ought	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
MEANS	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
attained.	1
Whether	1
there	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
federal	1
government	1
intrusted	1
with	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
defense,	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance,	1
open	1
for	1
discussion;	1
but	1
the	1
moment	1
it	1
is	1
decided	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative,	1
it	1
will	1
follow,	1
that	1
that	1
government	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
requisite	1
to	1
complete	1
execution	1
of	1
its	1
trust.	1
And	1
unless	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
shown	1
that	1
the	1
circumstances	1
which	1
may	1
affect	1
the	1
public	1
safety	1
are	1
reducible	1
within	1
certain	1
determinate	1
limits;	1
unless	1
the	1
contrary	1
of	1
this	1
position	1
can	1
be	1
fairly	1
and	1
rationally	1
disputed,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
admitted,	1
as	1
a	1
necessary	1
consequence,	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
limitation	1
of	1
that	1
authority	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
the	1
defense	1
and	1
protection	1
of	1
the	1
community,	1
in	1
any	1
matter	1
essential	1
to	1
its	1
efficacy	1
that	1
is,	1
in	1
any	1
matter	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
FORMATION,	1
DIRECTION,	1
or	1
SUPPORT	1
of	1
the	1
NATIONAL	1
FORCES.	1
Defective	1
as	1
the	1
present	1
Confederation	1
has	1
been	1
proved	1
to	1
be,	1
this	1
principle	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
fully	1
recognized	1
by	1
the	1
framers	1
of	1
it;	1
though	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
made	1
proper	1
or	1
adequate	1
provision	1
for	1
its	1
exercise.	1
Congress	1
have	1
an	1
unlimited	1
discretion	1
to	1
make	1
requisitions	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
money;	1
to	1
govern	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
navy;	1
to	1
direct	1
their	1
operations.	1
As	1
their	1
requisitions	1
are	1
made	1
constitutionally	1
binding	1
upon	1
the	1
States,	1
who	1
are	1
in	1
fact	1
under	1
the	1
most	1
solemn	1
obligations	1
to	1
furnish	1
the	1
supplies	1
required	1
of	1
them,	1
the	1
intention	1
evidently	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
should	1
command	1
whatever	1
resources	1
were	1
by	1
them	1
judged	1
requisite	1
to	1
the	1
"common	1
defense	1
and	1
general	1
welfare."	1
It	1
was	1
presumed	1
that	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
their	1
true	1
interests,	1
and	1
a	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
dictates	1
of	1
good	1
faith,	1
would	1
be	1
found	1
sufficient	1
pledges	1
for	1
the	1
punctual	1
performance	1
of	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
head.	1
The	1
experiment	1
has,	1
however,	1
demonstrated	1
that	1
this	1
expectation	1
was	1
ill-founded	1
and	1
illusory;	1
and	1
the	1
observations,	1
made	1
under	1
the	1
last	1
head,	1
will,	1
I	1
imagine,	1
have	1
sufficed	1
to	1
convince	1
the	1
impartial	1
and	1
discerning,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
absolute	1
necessity	1
for	1
an	1
entire	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
system;	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
earnest	1
about	1
giving	1
the	1
Union	1
energy	1
and	1
duration,	1
we	1
must	1
abandon	1
the	1
vain	1
project	1
of	1
legislating	1
upon	1
the	1
States	1
in	1
their	1
collective	1
capacities;	1
we	1
must	1
extend	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
to	1
the	1
individual	1
citizens	1
of	1
America;	1
we	1
must	1
discard	1
the	1
fallacious	1
scheme	1
of	1
quotas	1
and	1
requisitions,	1
as	1
equally	1
impracticable	1
and	1
unjust.	1
The	1
result	1
from	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
Union	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
invested	1
with	1
full	1
power	1
to	1
levy	1
troops;	1
to	1
build	1
and	1
equip	1
fleets;	1
and	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
revenues	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
required	1
for	1
the	1
formation	1
and	1
support	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
and	1
navy,	1
in	1
the	1
customary	1
and	1
ordinary	1
modes	1
practiced	1
in	1
other	1
governments.	1
If	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
our	1
country	1
are	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
demand	1
a	1
compound	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
simple,	1
a	1
confederate	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
sole,	1
government,	1
the	1
essential	1
point	1
which	1
will	1
remain	1
to	1
be	1
adjusted	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
discriminate	1
the	1
OBJECTS,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
done,	1
which	1
shall	1
appertain	1
to	1
the	1
different	1
provinces	1
or	1
departments	1
of	1
power;	1
allowing	1
to	1
each	1
the	1
most	1
ample	1
authority	1
for	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
objects	1
committed	1
to	1
its	1
charge.	1
Shall	1
the	1
Union	1
be	1
constituted	1
the	1
guardian	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
safety?	1
Are	1
fleets	1
and	1
armies	1
and	1
revenues	1
necessary	1
to	1
this	1
purpose?	1
The	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
must	1
be	1
empowered	1
to	1
pass	1
all	1
laws,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
regulations	1
which	1
have	1
relation	1
to	1
them.	1
The	1
same	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
commerce,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
other	1
matter	1
to	1
which	1
its	1
jurisdiction	1
is	1
permitted	1
to	1
extend.	1
Is	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
justice	1
between	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
State	1
the	1
proper	1
department	1
of	1
the	1
local	1
governments?	1
These	1
must	1
possess	1
all	1
the	1
authorities	1
which	1
are	1
connected	1
with	1
this	1
object,	1
and	1
with	1
every	1
other	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
allotted	1
to	1
their	1
particular	1
cognizance	1
and	1
direction.	1
Not	1
to	1
confer	1
in	1
each	1
case	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
power	1
commensurate	1
to	1
the	1
end,	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
violate	1
the	1
most	1
obvious	1
rules	1
of	1
prudence	1
and	1
propriety,	1
and	1
improvidently	1
to	1
trust	1
the	1
great	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
to	1
hands	1
which	1
are	1
disabled	1
from	1
managing	1
them	1
with	1
vigor	1
and	1
success.	1
Who	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
make	1
suitable	1
provisions	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
defense,	1
as	1
that	1
body	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
guardianship	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
safety	1
is	1
confided;	1
which,	1
as	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
information,	1
will	1
best	1
understand	1
the	1
extent	1
and	1
urgency	1
of	1
the	1
dangers	1
that	1
threaten;	1
as	1
the	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
WHOLE,	1
will	1
feel	1
itself	1
most	1
deeply	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
every	1
part;	1
which,	1
from	1
the	1
responsibility	1
implied	1
in	1
the	1
duty	1
assigned	1
to	1
it,	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
sensibly	1
impressed	1
with	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
proper	1
exertions;	1
and	1
which,	1
by	1
the	1
extension	1
of	1
its	1
authority	1
throughout	1
the	1
States,	1
can	1
alone	1
establish	1
uniformity	1
and	1
concert	1
in	1
the	1
plans	1
and	1
measures	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
common	1
safety	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
secured?	1
Is	1
there	1
not	1
a	1
manifest	1
inconsistency	1
in	1
devolving	1
upon	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
defense,	1
and	1
leaving	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
the	1
EFFECTIVE	1
powers	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
provided	1
for?	1
Is	1
not	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
co-operation	1
the	1
infallible	1
consequence	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
system?	1
And	1
will	1
not	1
weakness,	1
disorder,	1
an	1
undue	1
distribution	1
of	1
the	1
burdens	1
and	1
calamities	1
of	1
war,	1
an	1
unnecessary	1
and	1
intolerable	1
increase	1
of	1
expense,	1
be	1
its	1
natural	1
and	1
inevitable	1
concomitants?	1
Have	1
we	1
not	1
had	1
unequivocal	1
experience	1
of	1
its	1
effects	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
revolution	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
accomplished?	1
Every	1
view	1
we	1
may	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
subject,	1
as	1
candid	1
inquirers	1
after	1
truth,	1
will	1
serve	1
to	1
convince	1
us,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
both	1
unwise	1
and	1
dangerous	1
to	1
deny	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
an	1
unconfined	1
authority,	1
as	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
objects	1
which	1
are	1
intrusted	1
to	1
its	1
management.	1
It	1
will	1
indeed	1
deserve	1
the	1
most	1
vigilant	1
and	1
careful	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
modeled	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
admit	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
safely	1
vested	1
with	1
the	1
requisite	1
powers.	1
If	1
any	1
plan	1
which	1
has	1
been,	1
or	1
may	1
be,	1
offered	1
to	1
our	1
consideration,	1
should	1
not,	1
upon	1
a	1
dispassionate	1
inspection,	1
be	1
found	1
to	1
answer	1
this	1
description,	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
rejected.	1
A	1
government,	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
which	1
renders	1
it	1
unfit	1
to	1
be	1
trusted	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
which	1
a	1
free	1
people	1
OUGHT	1
TO	1
DELEGATE	1
TO	1
ANY	1
GOVERNMENT,	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
unsafe	1
and	1
improper	1
depositary	1
of	1
the	1
NATIONAL	1
INTERESTS.	1
Wherever	1
THESE	1
can	1
with	1
propriety	1
be	1
confided,	1
the	1
coincident	1
powers	1
may	1
safely	1
accompany	1
them.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
result	1
of	1
all	1
just	1
reasoning	1
upon	1
the	1
subject.	1
And	1
the	1
adversaries	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
promulgated	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
confined	1
themselves	1
to	1
showing,	1
that	1
the	1
internal	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
government	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
it	1
unworthy	1
of	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
They	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
wandered	1
into	1
inflammatory	1
declamations	1
and	1
unmeaning	1
cavils	1
about	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
powers.	1
The	1
POWERS	1
are	1
not	1
too	1
extensive	1
for	1
the	1
OBJECTS	1
of	1
federal	1
administration,	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
for	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
our	1
NATIONAL	1
INTERESTS;	1
nor	1
can	1
any	1
satisfactory	1
argument	1
be	1
framed	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
chargeable	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
excess.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
true,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
insinuated	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
writers	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
that	1
the	1
difficulty	1
arises	1
from	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
thing,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
will	1
not	1
permit	1
us	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
government	1
in	1
which	1
such	1
ample	1
powers	1
can	1
safely	1
be	1
reposed,	1
it	1
would	1
prove	1
that	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
contract	1
our	1
views,	1
and	1
resort	1
to	1
the	1
expedient	1
of	1
separate	1
confederacies,	1
which	1
will	1
move	1
within	1
more	1
practicable	1
spheres.	1
For	1
the	1
absurdity	1
must	1
continually	1
stare	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
confiding	1
to	1
a	1
government	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
essential	1
national	1
interests,	1
without	1
daring	1
to	1
trust	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
authorities	1
which	1
are	1
indispensible	1
to	1
their	1
proper	1
and	1
efficient	1
management.	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
reconcile	1
contradictions,	1
but	1
firmly	1
embrace	1
a	1
rational	1
alternative.	1
I	1
trust,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
impracticability	1
of	1
one	1
general	1
system	1
cannot	1
be	1
shown.	1
I	1
am	1
greatly	1
mistaken,	1
if	1
any	1
thing	1
of	1
weight	1
has	1
yet	1
been	1
advanced	1
of	1
this	1
tendency;	1
and	1
I	1
flatter	1
myself,	1
that	1
the	1
observations	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
papers	1
have	1
served	1
to	1
place	1
the	1
reverse	1
of	1
that	1
position	1
in	1
as	1
clear	1
a	1
light	1
as	1
any	1
matter	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
womb	1
of	1
time	1
and	1
experience	1
can	1
be	1
susceptible	1
of.	1
This,	1
at	1
all	1
events,	1
must	1
be	1
evident,	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
difficulty	1
itself,	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
is	1
the	1
strongest	1
argument	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
an	1
energetic	1
government;	1
for	1
any	1
other	1
can	1
certainly	1
never	1
preserve	1
the	1
Union	1
of	1
so	1
large	1
an	1
empire.	1
If	1
we	1
embrace	1
the	1
tenets	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
oppose	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
as	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
our	1
political	1
creed,	1
we	1
cannot	1
fail	1
to	1
verify	1
the	1
gloomy	1
doctrines	1
which	1
predict	1
the	1
impracticability	1
of	1
a	1
national	1
system	1
pervading	1
entire	1
limits	1
of	1
the	1
present	1

To	1
THE	1
powers	1
proposed	1
to	1
be	1
conferred	1
upon	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
creation	1
and	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
forces,	1
I	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
but	1
one	1
specific	1
objection,	1
which,	1
if	1
I	1
understand	1
it	1
right,	1
is	1
this,	1
that	1
proper	1
provision	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
made	1
against	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
standing	1
armies	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace;	1
an	1
objection	1
which,	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
endeavor	1
to	1
show,	1
rests	1
on	1
weak	1
and	1
unsubstantial	1
foundations.	1
It	1
has	1
indeed	1
been	1
brought	1
forward	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
vague	1
and	1
general	1
form,	1
supported	1
only	1
by	1
bold	1
assertions,	1
without	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
argument;	1
without	1
even	1
the	1
sanction	1
of	1
theoretical	1
opinions;	1
in	1
contradiction	1
to	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
other	1
free	1
nations,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
sense	1
of	1
America,	1
as	1
expressed	1
in	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
existing	1
constitutions.	1
The	1
proprietory	1
of	1
this	1
remark	1
will	1
appear,	1
the	1
moment	1
it	1
is	1
recollected	1
that	1
the	1
objection	1
under	1
consideration	1
turns	1
upon	1
a	1
supposed	1
necessity	1
of	1
restraining	1
the	1
LEGISLATIVE	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
military	1
establishments;	1
a	1
principle	1
unheard	1
of,	1
except	1
in	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
our	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
and	1
rejected	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
A	1
stranger	1
to	1
our	1
politics,	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
read	1
our	1
newspapers	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
juncture,	1
without	1
having	1
previously	1
inspected	1
the	1
plan	1
reported	1
by	1
the	1
convention,	1
would	1
be	1
naturally	1
led	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
two	1
conclusions:	1
either	1
that	1
it	1
contained	1
a	1
positive	1
injunction,	1
that	1
standing	1
armies	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
up	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace;	1
or	1
that	1
it	1
vested	1
in	1
the	1
EXECUTIVE	1
the	1
whole	1
power	1
of	1
levying	1
troops,	1
without	1
subjecting	1
his	1
discretion,	1
in	1
any	1
shape,	1
to	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
If	1
he	1
came	1
afterwards	1
to	1
peruse	1
the	1
plan	1
itself,	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
surprised	1
to	1
discover,	1
that	1
neither	1
the	1
one	1
nor	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
the	1
case;	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
power	1
of	1
raising	1
armies	1
was	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
LEGISLATURE,	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
EXECUTIVE;	1
that	1
this	1
legislature	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
popular	1
body,	1
consisting	1
of	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
periodically	1
elected;	1
and	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
provision	1
he	1
had	1
supposed	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
standing	1
armies,	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found,	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
this	1
object,	1
an	1
important	1
qualification	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
discretion,	1
in	1
that	1
clause	1
which	1
forbids	1
the	1
appropriation	1
of	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
for	1
any	1
longer	1
period	1
than	1
two	1
years	1
a	1
precaution	1
which,	1
upon	1
a	1
nearer	1
view	1
of	1
it,	1
will	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
real	1
security	1
against	1
the	1
keeping	1
up	1
of	1
troops	1
without	1
evident	1
necessity.	1
Disappointed	1
in	1
his	1
first	1
surmise,	1
the	1
person	1
I	1
have	1
supposed	1
would	1
be	1
apt	1
to	1
pursue	1
his	1
conjectures	1
a	1
little	1
further.	1
He	1
would	1
naturally	1
say	1
to	1
himself,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
vehement	1
and	1
pathetic	1
declamation	1
can	1
be	1
without	1
some	1
colorable	1
pretext.	1
It	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
that	1
this	1
people,	1
so	1
jealous	1
of	1
their	1
liberties,	1
have,	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
preceding	1
models	1
of	1
the	1
constitutions	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
established,	1
inserted	1
the	1
most	1
precise	1
and	1
rigid	1
precautions	1
on	1
this	1
point,	1
the	1
omission	1
of	1
which,	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
plan,	1
has	1
given	1
birth	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
apprehension	1
and	1
clamor.	1
If,	1
under	1
this	1
impression,	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
review	1
the	1
several	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
how	1
great	1
would	1
be	1
his	1
disappointment	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
TWO	1
ONLY	1
of	1
them	1
[1]	1
contained	1
an	1
interdiction	1
of	1
standing	1
armies	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace;	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
eleven	1
had	1
either	1
observed	1
a	1
profound	1
silence	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
or	1
had	1
in	1
express	1
terms	1
admitted	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
Legislature	1
to	1
authorize	1
their	1
existence.	1
Still,	1
however	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
plausible	1
foundation	1
for	1
the	1
cry	1
raised	1
on	1
this	1
head.	1
He	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
imagine,	1
while	1
any	1
source	1
of	1
information	1
remained	1
unexplored,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
experiment	1
upon	1
the	1
public	1
credulity,	1
dictated	1
either	1
by	1
a	1
deliberate	1
intention	1
to	1
deceive,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
overflowings	1
of	1
a	1
zeal	1
too	1
intemperate	1
to	1
be	1
ingenuous.	1
It	1
would	1
probably	1
occur	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
precautions	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
primitive	1
compact	1
between	1
the	1
States.	1
Here,	1
at	1
length,	1
he	1
would	1
expect	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
the	1
enigma.	1
No	1
doubt,	1
he	1
would	1
observe	1
to	1
himself,	1
the	1
existing	1
Confederation	1
must	1
contain	1
the	1
most	1
explicit	1
provisions	1
against	1
military	1
establishments	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace;	1
and	1
a	1
departure	1
from	1
this	1
model,	1
in	1
a	1
favorite	1
point,	1
has	1
occasioned	1
the	1
discontent	1
which	1
appears	1
to	1
influence	1
these	1
political	1
champions.	1
If	1
he	1
should	1
now	1
apply	1
himself	1
to	1
a	1
careful	1
and	1
critical	1
survey	1
of	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation,	1
his	1
astonishment	1
would	1
not	1
only	1
be	1
increased,	1
but	1
would	1
acquire	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
indignation,	1
at	1
the	1
unexpected	1
discovery,	1
that	1
these	1
articles,	1
instead	1
of	1
containing	1
the	1
prohibition	1
he	1
looked	1
for,	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
had,	1
with	1
jealous	1
circumspection,	1
restricted	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
had	1
not	1
imposed	1
a	1
single	1
restraint	1
on	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
If	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
quick	1
sensibility,	1
or	1
ardent	1
temper,	1
he	1
could	1
now	1
no	1
longer	1
refrain	1
from	1
regarding	1
these	1
clamors	1
as	1
the	1
dishonest	1
artifices	1
of	1
a	1
sinister	1
and	1
unprincipled	1
opposition	1
to	1
a	1
plan	1
which	1
ought	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
fair	1
and	1
candid	1
examination	1
from	1
all	1
sincere	1
lovers	1
of	1
their	1
country!	1
How	1
else,	1
he	1
would	1
say,	1
could	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
been	1
tempted	1
to	1
vent	1
such	1
loud	1
censures	1
upon	1
that	1
plan,	1
about	1
a	1
point	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
conformed	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
sense	1
of	1
America	1
as	1
declared	1
in	1
its	1
different	1
forms	1
of	1
government,	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
even	1
superadded	1
a	1
new	1
and	1
powerful	1
guard	1
unknown	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
them?	1
If,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
calm	1
and	1
dispassionate	1
feelings,	1
he	1
would	1
indulge	1
a	1
sigh	1
for	1
the	1
frailty	1
of	1
human	1
nature,	1
and	1
would	1
lament,	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
so	1
interesting	1
to	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
millions,	1
the	1
true	1
merits	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
should	1
be	1
perplexed	1
and	1
entangled	1
by	1
expedients	1
so	1
unfriendly	1
to	1
an	1
impartial	1
and	1
right	1
determination.	1
Even	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
could	1
hardly	1
forbear	1
remarking,	1
that	1
a	1
conduct	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
has	1
too	1
much	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
an	1
intention	1
to	1
mislead	1
the	1
people	1
by	1
alarming	1
their	1
passions,	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
convince	1
them	1
by	1
arguments	1
addressed	1
to	1
their	1
understandings.	1
But	1
however	1
little	1
this	1
objection	1
may	1
be	1
countenanced,	1
even	1
by	1
precedents	1
among	1
ourselves,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
satisfactory	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
nearer	1
view	1
of	1
its	1
intrinsic	1
merits.	1
From	1
a	1
close	1
examination	1
it	1
will	1
appear	1
that	1
restraints	1
upon	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
military	1
establishments	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace,	1
would	1
be	1
improper	1
to	1
be	1
imposed,	1
and	1
if	1
imposed,	1
from	1
the	1
necessities	1
of	1
society,	1
would	1
be	1
unlikely	1
to	1
be	1
observed.	1
Though	1
a	1
wide	1
ocean	1
separates	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
from	1
Europe,	1
yet	1
there	1
are	1
various	1
considerations	1
that	1
warn	1
us	1
against	1
an	1
excess	1
of	1
confidence	1
or	1
security.	1
On	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
stretching	1
far	1
into	1
our	1
rear,	1
are	1
growing	1
settlements	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
dominion	1
of	1
Britain.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
and	1
extending	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
British	1
settlements,	1
are	1
colonies	1
and	1
establishments	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
dominion	1
of	1
Spain.	1
This	1
situation	1
and	1
the	1
vicinity	1
of	1
the	1
West	1
India	1
Islands,	1
belonging	1
to	1
these	1
two	1
powers	1
create	1
between	1
them,	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
their	1
American	1
possessions	1
and	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
us,	1
a	1
common	1
interest.	1
The	1
savage	1
tribes	1
on	1
our	1
Western	1
frontier	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
our	1
natural	1
enemies,	1
their	1
natural	1
allies,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
most	1
to	1
fear	1
from	1
us,	1
and	1
most	1
to	1
hope	1
from	1
them.	1
The	1
improvements	1
in	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
navigation	1
have,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
facility	1
of	1
communication,	1
rendered	1
distant	1
nations,	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure,	1
neighbors.	1
Britain	1
and	1
Spain	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
principal	1
maritime	1
powers	1
of	1
Europe.	1
A	1
future	1
concert	1
of	1
views	1
between	1
these	1
nations	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
improbable.	1
The	1
increasing	1
remoteness	1
of	1
consanguinity	1
is	1
every	1
day	1
diminishing	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
compact	1
between	1
France	1
and	1
Spain.	1
And	1
politicians	1
have	1
ever	1
with	1
great	1
reason	1
considered	1
the	1
ties	1
of	1
blood	1
as	1
feeble	1
and	1
precarious	1
links	1
of	1
political	1
connection.	1
These	1
circumstances	1
combined,	1
admonish	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
too	1
sanguine	1
in	1
considering	1
ourselves	1
as	1
entirely	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
danger.	1
Previous	1
to	1
the	1
Revolution,	1
and	1
ever	1
since	1
the	1
peace,	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
constant	1
necessity	1
for	1
keeping	1
small	1
garrisons	1
on	1
our	1
Western	1
frontier.	1
No	1
person	1
can	1
doubt	1
that	1
these	1
will	1
continue	1
to	1
be	1
indispensable,	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
only	1
be	1
against	1
the	1
ravages	1
and	1
depredations	1
of	1
the	1
Indians.	1
These	1
garrisons	1
must	1
either	1
be	1
furnished	1
by	1
occasional	1
detachments	1
from	1
the	1
militia,	1
or	1
by	1
permanent	1
corps	1
in	1
the	1
pay	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
The	1
first	1
is	1
impracticable;	1
and	1
if	1
practicable,	1
would	1
be	1
pernicious.	1
The	1
militia	1
would	1
not	1
long,	1
if	1
at	1
all,	1
submit	1
to	1
be	1
dragged	1
from	1
their	1
occupations	1
and	1
families	1
to	1
perform	1
that	1
most	1
disagreeable	1
duty	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
profound	1
peace.	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
or	1
compelled	1
to	1
do	1
it,	1
the	1
increased	1
expense	1
of	1
a	1
frequent	1
rotation	1
of	1
service,	1
and	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
labor	1
and	1
disconcertion	1
of	1
the	1
industrious	1
pursuits	1
of	1
individuals,	1
would	1
form	1
conclusive	1
objections	1
to	1
the	1
scheme.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
burdensome	1
and	1
injurious	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
as	1
ruinous	1
to	1
private	1
citizens.	1
The	1
latter	1
resource	1
of	1
permanent	1
corps	1
in	1
the	1
pay	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
amounts	1
to	1
a	1
standing	1
army	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace;	1
a	1
small	1
one,	1
indeed,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
less	1
real	1
for	1
being	1
small.	1
Here	1
is	1
a	1
simple	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
subject,	1
that	1
shows	1
us	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
a	1
constitutional	1
interdiction	1
of	1
such	1
establishments,	1
and	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
leaving	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
discretion	1
and	1
prudence	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
In	1
proportion	1
to	1
our	1
increase	1
in	1
strength,	1
it	1
is	1
probable,	1
nay,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
certain,	1
that	1
Britain	1
and	1
Spain	1
would	1
augment	1
their	1
military	1
establishments	1
in	1
our	1
neighborhood.	1
If	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
be	1
exposed,	1
in	1
a	1
naked	1
and	1
defenseless	1
condition,	1
to	1
their	1
insults	1
and	1
encroachments,	1
we	1
should	1
find	1
it	1
expedient	1
to	1
increase	1
our	1
frontier	1
garrisons	1
in	1
some	1
ratio	1
to	1
the	1
force	1
by	1
which	1
our	1
Western	1
settlements	1
might	1
be	1
annoyed.	1
There	1
are,	1
and	1
will	1
be,	1
particular	1
posts,	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
which	1
will	1
include	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
large	1
districts	1
of	1
territory,	1
and	1
facilitate	1
future	1
invasions	1
of	1
the	1
remainder.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
added	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
posts	1
will	1
be	1
keys	1
to	1
the	1
trade	1
with	1
the	1
Indian	1
nations.	1
Can	1
any	1
man	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
wise	1
to	1
leave	1
such	1
posts	1
in	1
a	1
situation	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
any	1
instant	1
seized	1
by	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
two	1
neighboring	1
and	1
formidable	1
powers?	1
To	1
act	1
this	1
part	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
desert	1
all	1
the	1
usual	1
maxims	1
of	1
prudence	1
and	1
policy.	1
If	1
we	1
mean	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
commercial	1
people,	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
be	1
secure	1
on	1
our	1
Atlantic	1
side,	1
we	1
must	1
endeavor,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible,	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
navy.	1
To	1
this	1
purpose	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
dock-yards	1
and	1
arsenals;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
these,	1
fortifications,	1
and	1
probably	1
garrisons.	1
When	1
a	1
nation	1
has	1
become	1
so	1
powerful	1
by	1
sea	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
protect	1
its	1
dock-yards	1
by	1
its	1
fleets,	1
this	1
supersedes	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
garrisons	1
for	1
that	1
purpose;	1
but	1
where	1
naval	1
establishments	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
infancy,	1
moderate	1
garrisons	1
will,	1
in	1
all	1
likelihood,	1
be	1
found	1
an	1
indispensable	1
security	1
against	1
descents	1
for	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
arsenals	1
and	1
dock-yards,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
of	1
the	1
fleet	1
itself.	1
PUBLIUS.	1
FNA1-@1	1
This	1
statement	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
printed	1
collection	1
of	1
State	1
constitutions.	1
Pennsylvania	1
and	1
North	1
Carolina	1
are	1
the	1
two	1
which	1
contain	1
the	1
interdiction	1
in	1
these	1
words:	1
"As	1
standing	1
armies	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace	1
are	1
dangerous	1
to	1
liberty,	1
THEY	1
OUGHT	1
NOT	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1

This	1
is,	1
in	1
truth,	1
rather	1
a	1
CAUTION	1
than	1
a	1
PROHIBITION.	1
New	1
Hampshire,	1
Massachusetts,	1
Delaware,	1
and	1
Maryland	1
have,	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
their	1
bils	1
of	1
rights,	1
a	1
clause	1
to	1
this	1
effect:	1
"Standing	1
armies	1
are	1
dangerous	1
to	1
liberty,	1
and	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
raised	1
or	1

which	1
is	1
a	1
formal	1
admission	1
of	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Legislature.	1
New	1
York	1
has	1
no	1
bills	1
of	1
rights,	1
and	1
her	1

not	1
a	1

the	1

the	1

I	1
am	1
told,	1
however	1
that	1
one	1

two	1

have	1
bills	1
of	1
rights	1
which	1
do	1
not	1

that	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
IT	1
MAY	1
perhaps	1
be	1
urged	1
that	1
the	1
objects	1
enumerated	1
in	1
the	1
preceding	1
number	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
provided	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
under	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
But	1
this	1
would	1
be,	1
in	1
reality,	1
an	1
inversion	1
of	1
the	1
primary	1
principle	1
of	1
our	1
political	1
association,	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
in	1
practice	1
transfer	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
defense	1
from	1
the	1
federal	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
individual	1
members:	1
a	1
project	1
oppressive	1
to	1
some	1
States,	1
dangerous	1
to	1
all,	1
and	1
baneful	1
to	1
the	1
Confederacy.	1
The	1
territories	1
of	1
Britain,	1
Spain,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Indian	1
nations	1
in	1
our	1
neighborhood	1
do	1
not	1
border	1
on	1
particular	1
States,	1
but	1
encircle	1
the	1
Union	1
from	1
Maine	1
to	1
Georgia.	1
The	1
danger,	1
though	1
in	1
different	1
degrees,	1
is	1
therefore	1
common.	1
And	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
guarding	1
against	1
it	1
ought,	1
in	1
like	1
manner,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
common	1
councils	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
treasury.	1
It	1
happens	1
that	1
some	1
States,	1
from	1
local	1
situation,	1
are	1
more	1
directly	1
exposed.	1
New	1
York	1
is	1
of	1
this	1
class.	1
Upon	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
separate	1
provisions,	1
New	1
York	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
sustain	1
the	1
whole	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
establishments	1
requisite	1
to	1
her	1
immediate	1
safety,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
mediate	1
or	1
ultimate	1
protection	1
of	1
her	1
neighbors.	1
This	1
would	1
neither	1
be	1
equitable	1
as	1
it	1
respected	1
New	1
York	1
nor	1
safe	1
as	1
it	1
respected	1
the	1
other	1
States.	1
Various	1
inconveniences	1
would	1
attend	1
such	1
a	1
system.	1
The	1
States,	1
to	1
whose	1
lot	1
it	1
might	1
fall	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
necessary	1
establishments,	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
little	1
able	1
as	1
willing,	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
competent	1
provisions.	1
The	1
security	1
of	1
all	1
would	1
thus	1
be	1
subjected	1
to	1
the	1
parsimony,	1
improvidence,	1
or	1
inability	1
of	1
a	1
part.	1
If	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
such	1
part	1
becoming	1
more	1
abundant	1
and	1
extensive,	1
its	1
provisions	1
should	1
be	1
proportionally	1
enlarged,	1
the	1
other	1
States	1
would	1
quickly	1
take	1
the	1
alarm	1
at	1
seeing	1
the	1
whole	1
military	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
its	1
members,	1
and	1
those	1
probably	1
amongst	1
the	1
most	1
powerful.	1
They	1
would	1
each	1
choose	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
counterpoise,	1
and	1
pretenses	1
could	1
easily	1
be	1
contrived.	1
In	1
this	1
situation,	1
military	1
establishments,	1
nourished	1
by	1
mutual	1
jealousy,	1
would	1
be	1
apt	1
to	1
swell	1
beyond	1
their	1
natural	1
or	1
proper	1
size;	1
and	1
being	1
at	1
the	1
separate	1
disposal	1
of	1
the	1
members,	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
engines	1
for	1
the	1
abridgment	1
or	1
demolition	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
authority.	1
Reasons	1
have	1
been	1
already	1
given	1
to	1
induce	1
a	1
supposition	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
will	1
too	1
naturally	1
be	1
prone	1
to	1
a	1
rivalship	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
power;	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
any	1
contest	1
between	1
the	1
federal	1
head	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
members	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
apt	1
to	1
unite	1
with	1
their	1
local	1
government.	1
If,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
this	1
immense	1
advantage,	1
the	1
ambition	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
should	1
be	1
stimulated	1
by	1
the	1
separate	1
and	1
independent	1
possession	1
of	1
military	1
forces,	1
it	1
would	1
afford	1
too	1
strong	1
a	1
temptation	1
and	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
facility	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
make	1
enterprises	1
upon,	1
and	1
finally	1
to	1
subvert,	1
the	1
constitutional	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
would	1
be	1
less	1
safe	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
than	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
left	1
the	1
national	1
forces	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
an	1
army	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
dangerous	1
weapon	1
of	1
power,	1
it	1
had	1
better	1
be	1
in	1
those	1
hands	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
jealous	1
than	1
in	1
those	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
least	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
jealous.	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
truth,	1
which	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
ages	1
has	1
attested,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
always	1
most	1
in	1
danger	1
when	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
injuring	1
their	1
rights	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
those	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
entertain	1
the	1
least	1
suspicion.	1
The	1
framers	1
of	1
the	1
existing	1
Confederation,	1
fully	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
danger	1
to	1
the	1
Union	1
from	1
the	1
separate	1
possession	1
of	1
military	1
forces	1
by	1
the	1
States,	1
have,	1
in	1
express	1
terms,	1
prohibited	1
them	1
from	1
having	1
either	1
ships	1
or	1
troops,	1
unless	1
with	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
Congress.	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
a	1
federal	1
government	1
and	1
military	1
establishments	1
under	1
State	1
authority	1
are	1
not	1
less	1
at	1
variance	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
than	1
a	1
due	1
supply	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
treasury	1
and	1
the	1
system	1
of	1
quotas	1
and	1
requisitions.	1
There	1
are	1
other	1
lights	1
besides	1
those	1
already	1
taken	1
notice	1
of,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
restraints	1
on	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
will	1
be	1
equally	1
manifest.	1
The	1
design	1
of	1
the	1
objection,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
mentioned,	1
is	1
to	1
preclude	1
standing	1
armies	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace,	1
though	1
we	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
informed	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
is	1
designed	1
the	1
prohibition	1
should	1
extend;	1
whether	1
to	1
raising	1
armies	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
KEEPING	1
THEM	1
UP	1
in	1
a	1
season	1
of	1
tranquillity	1
or	1
not.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
latter	1
it	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
precise	1
signification,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
ineffectual	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
intended.	1
When	1
armies	1
are	1
once	1
raised	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
denominated	1
"keeping	1
them	1
up,"	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution?	1
What	1
time	1
shall	1
be	1
requisite	1
to	1
ascertain	1
the	1
violation?	1
Shall	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
week,	1
a	1
month,	1
a	1
year?	1
Or	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
continued	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
danger	1
which	1
occasioned	1
their	1
being	1
raised	1
continues?	1
This	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
kept	1
up	1
IN	1
TIME	1
OF	1
PEACE,	1
against	1
threatening	1
or	1
impending	1
danger,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
deviate	1
from	1
the	1
literal	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
prohibition,	1
and	1
to	1
introduce	1
an	1
extensive	1
latitude	1
of	1
construction.	1
Who	1
shall	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
continuance	1
of	1
the	1
danger?	1
This	1
must	1
undoubtedly	1
be	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
and	1
the	1
matter	1
would	1
then	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
this	1
issue,	1
that	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
to	1
provide	1
against	1
apprehended	1
danger,	1
might	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance	1
raise	1
troops,	1
and	1
might	1
afterwards	1
keep	1
them	1
on	1
foot	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
supposed	1
the	1
peace	1
or	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
was	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
of	1
jeopardy.	1
It	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
a	1
discretion	1
so	1
latitudinary	1
as	1
this	1
would	1
afford	1
ample	1
room	1
for	1
eluding	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
provision.	1
The	1
supposed	1
utility	1
of	1
a	1
provision	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
founded	1
on	1
the	1
supposed	1
probability,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
possibility,	1
of	1
a	1
combination	1
between	1
the	1
executive	1
and	1
the	1
legislative,	1
in	1
some	1
scheme	1
of	1
usurpation.	1
Should	1
this	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
happen,	1
how	1
easy	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
fabricate	1
pretenses	1
of	1
approaching	1
danger!	1
Indian	1
hostilities,	1
instigated	1
by	1
Spain	1
or	1
Britain,	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
at	1
hand.	1
Provocations	1
to	1
produce	1
the	1
desired	1
appearances	1
might	1
even	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
some	1
foreign	1
power,	1
and	1
appeased	1
again	1
by	1
timely	1
concessions.	1
If	1
we	1
can	1
reasonably	1
presume	1
such	1
a	1
combination	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
formed,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
enterprise	1
is	1
warranted	1
by	1
a	1
sufficient	1
prospect	1
of	1
success,	1
the	1
army,	1
when	1
once	1
raised,	1
from	1
whatever	1
cause,	1
or	1
on	1
whatever	1
pretext,	1
may	1
be	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
project.	1
If,	1
to	1
obviate	1
this	1
consequence,	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
resolved	1
to	1
extend	1
the	1
prohibition	1
to	1
the	1
RAISING	1
of	1
armies	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace,	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
would	1
then	1
exhibit	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
spectacle	1
which	1
the	1
world	1
has	1
yet	1
seen,	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
nation	1
incapacitated	1
by	1
its	1
Constitution	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
defense,	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
actually	1
invaded.	1
As	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
a	1
formal	1
denunciation	1
of	1
war	1
has	1
of	1
late	1
fallen	1
into	1
disuse,	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
an	1
enemy	1
within	1
our	1
territories	1
must	1
be	1
waited	1
for,	1
as	1
the	1
legal	1
warrant	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
begin	1
its	1
levies	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
the	1
State.	1
We	1
must	1
receive	1
the	1
blow,	1
before	1
we	1
could	1
even	1
prepare	1
to	1
return	1
it.	1
All	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
policy	1
by	1
which	1
nations	1
anticipate	1
distant	1
danger,	1
and	1
meet	1
the	1
gathering	1
storm,	1
must	1
be	1
abstained	1
from,	1
as	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
genuine	1
maxims	1
of	1
a	1
free	1
government.	1
We	1
must	1
expose	1
our	1
property	1
and	1
liberty	1
to	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
foreign	1
invaders,	1
and	1
invite	1
them	1
by	1
our	1
weakness	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1
naked	1
and	1
defenseless	1
prey,	1
because	1
we	1
are	1
afraid	1
that	1
rulers,	1
created	1
by	1
our	1
choice,	1
dependent	1
on	1
our	1
will,	1
might	1
endanger	1
that	1
liberty,	1
by	1
an	1
abuse	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
necessary	1
to	1
its	1
preservation.	1
Here	1
I	1
expect	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
told	1
that	1
the	1
militia	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
is	1
its	1
natural	1
bulwark,	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
defense.	1
This	1
doctrine,	1
in	1
substance,	1
had	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
lost	1
us	1
our	1
independence.	1
It	1
cost	1
millions	1
to	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
saved.	1
The	1
facts	1
which,	1
from	1
our	1
own	1
experience,	1
forbid	1
a	1
reliance	1
of	1
this	1
kind,	1
are	1
too	1
recent	1
to	1
permit	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
dupes	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
suggestion.	1
The	1
steady	1
operations	1
of	1
war	1
against	1
a	1
regular	1
and	1
disciplined	1
army	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
successfully	1
conducted	1
by	1
a	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind.	1
Considerations	1
of	1
economy,	1
not	1
less	1
than	1
of	1
stability	1
and	1
vigor,	1
confirm	1
this	1
position.	1
The	1
American	1
militia,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
war,	1
have,	1
by	1
their	1
valor	1
on	1
numerous	1
occasions,	1
erected	1
eternal	1
monuments	1
to	1
their	1
fame;	1
but	1
the	1
bravest	1
of	1
them	1
feel	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
established	1
by	1
their	1
efforts	1
alone,	1
however	1
great	1
and	1
valuable	1
they	1
were.	1
War,	1
like	1
most	1
other	1
things,	1
is	1
a	1
science	1
to	1
be	1
acquired	1
and	1
perfected	1
by	1
diligence,	1
by	1
perserverance,	1
by	1
time,	1
and	1
by	1
practice.	1
All	1
violent	1
policy,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
natural	1
and	1
experienced	1
course	1
of	1
human	1
affairs,	1
defeats	1
itself.	1
Pennsylvania,	1
at	1
this	1
instant,	1
affords	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
this	1
remark.	1
The	1
Bill	1
of	1
Rights	1
of	1
that	1
State	1
declares	1
that	1
standing	1
armies	1
are	1
dangerous	1
to	1
liberty,	1
and	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
up	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace.	1
Pennsylvania,	1
nevertheless,	1
in	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
profound	1
peace,	1
from	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
partial	1
disorders	1
in	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
her	1
counties,	1
has	1
resolved	1
to	1
raise	1
a	1
body	1
of	1
troops;	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
will	1
keep	1
them	1
up	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
appearance	1
of	1
danger	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
peace.	1
The	1
conduct	1
of	1
Massachusetts	1
affords	1
a	1
lesson	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
subject,	1
though	1
on	1
different	1
ground.	1
That	1
State	1
(without	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
sanction	1
of	1
Congress,	1
as	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation	1
require)	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
raise	1
troops	1
to	1
quell	1
a	1
domestic	1
insurrection,	1
and	1
still	1
keeps	1
a	1
corps	1
in	1
pay	1
to	1
prevent	1
a	1
revival	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
revolt.	1
The	1
particular	1
constitution	1
of	1
Massachusetts	1
opposed	1
no	1
obstacle	1
to	1
the	1
measure;	1
but	1
the	1
instance	1
is	1
still	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
instruct	1
us	1
that	1
cases	1
are	1
likely	1
to	1
occur	1
under	1
our	1
government,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
under	1
those	1
of	1
other	1
nations,	1
which	1
will	1
sometimes	1
render	1
a	1
military	1
force	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
the	1
society,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
therefore	1
improper	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
to	1
control	1
the	1
legislative	1
discretion.	1
It	1
also	1
teaches	1
us,	1
in	1
its	1
application	1
to	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
how	1
little	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
a	1
feeble	1
government	1
are	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
respected,	1
even	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
constituents.	1
And	1
it	1
teaches	1
us,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
rest,	1
how	1
unequal	1
parchment	1
provisions	1
are	1
to	1
a	1
struggle	1
with	1
public	1
necessity.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
fundamental	1
maxim	1
of	1
the	1
Lacedaemonian	1
commonwealth,	1
that	1
the	1
post	1
of	1
admiral	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
conferred	1
twice	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
person.	1
The	1
Peloponnesian	1
confederates,	1
having	1
suffered	1
a	1
severe	1
defeat	1
at	1
sea	1
from	1
the	1
Athenians,	1
demanded	1
Lysander,	1
who	1
had	1
before	1
served	1
with	1
success	1
in	1
that	1
capacity,	1
to	1
command	1
the	1
combined	1
fleets.	1
The	1
Lacedaemonians,	1
to	1
gratify	1
their	1
allies,	1
and	1
yet	1
preserve	1
the	1
semblance	1
of	1
an	1
adherence	1
to	1
their	1
ancient	1
institutions,	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
flimsy	1
subterfuge	1
of	1
investing	1
Lysander	1
with	1
the	1
real	1
power	1
of	1
admiral,	1
under	1
the	1
nominal	1
title	1
of	1
vice-admiral.	1
This	1
instance	1
is	1
selected	1
from	1
among	1
a	1
multitude	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
cited	1
to	1
confirm	1
the	1
truth	1
already	1
advanced	1
and	1
illustrated	1
by	1
domestic	1
examples;	1
which	1
is,	1
that	1
nations	1
pay	1
little	1
regard	1
to	1
rules	1
and	1
maxims	1
calculated	1
in	1
their	1
very	1
nature	1
to	1
run	1
counter	1
to	1
the	1
necessities	1
of	1
society.	1
Wise	1
politicians	1
will	1
be	1
cautious	1
about	1
fettering	1
the	1
government	1
with	1
restrictions	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
observed,	1
because	1
they	1
know	1
that	1
every	1
breach	1
of	1
the	1
fundamental	1
laws,	1
though	1
dictated	1
by	1
necessity,	1
impairs	1
that	1
sacred	1
reverence	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
maintained	1
in	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
rulers	1
towards	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
a	1
country,	1
and	1
forms	1
a	1
precedent	1
for	1
other	1
breaches	1
where	1
the	1
same	1
plea	1
of	1
necessity	1
does	1
not	1
exist	1
at	1
all,	1
or	1
is	1
less	1
urgent	1
and	1
palpable.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1

York:	1
IT	1
WAS	1
a	1
thing	1
hardly	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
popular	1
revolution	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
men	1
should	1
stop	1
at	1
that	1
happy	1
mean	1
which	1
marks	1
the	1
salutary	1
boundary	1
between	1
POWER	1
and	1
PRIVILEGE,	1
and	1
combines	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
government	1
with	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
private	1
rights.	1
A	1
failure	1
in	1
this	1
delicate	1
and	1
important	1
point	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
source	1
of	1
the	1
inconveniences	1
we	1
experience,	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
cautious	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
repetition	1
of	1
the	1
error,	1
in	1
our	1
future	1
attempts	1
to	1
rectify	1
and	1
ameliorate	1
our	1
system,	1
we	1
may	1
travel	1
from	1
one	1
chimerical	1
project	1
to	1
another;	1
we	1
may	1
try	1
change	1
after	1
change;	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
material	1
change	1
for	1
the	1
better.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
restraining	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority,	1
in	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
providing	1
for	1
the	1
national	1
defense,	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
refinements	1
which	1
owe	1
their	1
origin	1
to	1
a	1
zeal	1
for	1
liberty	1
more	1
ardent	1
than	1
enlightened.	1
We	1
have	1
seen,	1
however,	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
had	1
thus	1
far	1
an	1
extensive	1
prevalency;	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
country,	1
where	1
it	1
made	1
its	1
first	1
appearance,	1
Pennsylvania	1
and	1
North	1
Carolina	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
two	1
States	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
patronized;	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
have	1
refused	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
the	1
least	1
countenance;	1
wisely	1
judging	1
that	1
confidence	1
must	1
be	1
placed	1
somewhere;	1
that	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
doing	1
it,	1
is	1
implied	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act	1
of	1
delegating	1
power;	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
hazard	1
the	1
abuse	1
of	1
that	1
confidence	1
than	1
to	1
embarrass	1
the	1
government	1
and	1
endanger	1
the	1
public	1
safety	1
by	1
impolitic	1
restrictions	1
on	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority.	1
The	1
opponents	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
combat,	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
the	1
general	1
decision	1
of	1
America;	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
taught	1
by	1
experience	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
correcting	1
any	1
extremes	1
into	1
which	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
heretofore	1
run,	1
they	1
appear	1
disposed	1
to	1
conduct	1
us	1
into	1
others	1
still	1
more	1
dangerous,	1
and	1
more	1
extravagant.	1
As	1
if	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
government	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
too	1
high,	1
or	1
too	1
rigid,	1
the	1
doctrines	1
they	1
teach	1
are	1
calculated	1
to	1
induce	1
us	1
to	1
depress	1
or	1
to	1
relax	1
it,	1
by	1
expedients	1
which,	1
upon	1
other	1
occasions,	1
have	1
been	1
condemned	1
or	1
forborne.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
affirmed	1
without	1
the	1
imputation	1
of	1
invective,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
principles	1
they	1
inculcate,	1
on	1
various	1
points,	1
could	1
so	1
far	1
obtain	1
as	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
popular	1
creed,	1
they	1
would	1
utterly	1
unfit	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
this	1
country	1
for	1
any	1
species	1
of	1
government	1
whatever.	1
But	1
a	1
danger	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
apprehended.	1
The	1
citizens	1
of	1
America	1
have	1
too	1
much	1
discernment	1
to	1
be	1
argued	1
into	1
anarchy.	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken,	1
if	1
experience	1
has	1
not	1
wrought	1
a	1
deep	1
and	1
solemn	1
conviction	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
mind,	1
that	1
greater	1
energy	1
of	1
government	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
welfare	1
and	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
It	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
amiss	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
concisely	1
to	1
remark	1
the	1
origin	1
and	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
idea,	1
which	1
aims	1
at	1
the	1
exclusion	1
of	1
military	1
establishments	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace.	1
Though	1
in	1
speculative	1
minds	1
it	1
may	1
arise	1
from	1
a	1
contemplation	1
of	1
the	1
nature	1
and	1
tendency	1
of	1
such	1
institutions,	1
fortified	1
by	1
the	1
events	1
that	1
have	1
happened	1
in	1
other	1
ages	1
and	1
countries,	1
yet	1
as	1
a	1
national	1
sentiment,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
traced	1
to	1
those	1
habits	1
of	1
thinking	1
which	1
we	1
derive	1
from	1
the	1
nation	1
from	1
whom	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
these	1
States	1
have	1
in	1
general	1
sprung.	1
In	1
England,	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
after	1
the	1
Norman	1
Conquest,	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
monarch	1
was	1
almost	1
unlimited.	1
Inroads	1
were	1
gradually	1
made	1
upon	1
the	1
prerogative,	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
liberty,	1
first	1
by	1
the	1
barons,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
till	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
its	1
most	1
formidable	1
pretensions	1
became	1
extinct.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
revolution	1
in	1
1688,	1
which	1
elevated	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
Orange	1
to	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
that	1
English	1
liberty	1
was	1
completely	1
triumphant.	1
As	1
incident	1
to	1
the	1
undefined	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
war,	1
an	1
acknowledged	1
prerogative	1
of	1
the	1
crown,	1
Charles	1
II.	1
had,	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
authority,	1
kept	1
on	1
foot	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace	1
a	1
body	1
of	1
5,000	1
regular	1
troops.	1
And	1
this	1
number	1
James	1
II.	1
increased	1
to	1
30,000;	1
who	1
were	1
paid	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
civil	1
list.	1
At	1
the	1
revolution,	1
to	1
abolish	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
so	1
dangerous	1
an	1
authority,	1
it	1
became	1
an	1
article	1
of	1
the	1
Bill	1
of	1
Rights	1
then	1
framed,	1
that	1
"the	1
raising	1
or	1
keeping	1
a	1
standing	1
army	1
within	1
the	1
kingdom	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace,	1
UNLESS	1
WITH	1
THE	1
CONSENT	1
OF	1
PARLIAMENT,	1
was	1
against	1
law."	1
In	1
that	1
kingdom,	1
when	1
the	1
pulse	1
of	1
liberty	1
was	1
at	1
its	1
highest	1
pitch,	1
no	1
security	1
against	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
standing	1
armies	1
was	1
thought	1
requisite,	1
beyond	1
a	1
prohibition	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
raised	1
or	1
kept	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
mere	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate.	1
The	1
patriots,	1
who	1
effected	1
that	1
memorable	1
revolution,	1
were	1
too	1
temperate,	1
too	1
wellinformed,	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
any	1
restraint	1
on	1
the	1
legislative	1
discretion.	1
They	1
were	1
aware	1
that	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
of	1
troops	1
for	1
guards	1
and	1
garrisons	1
were	1
indispensable;	1
that	1
no	1
precise	1
bounds	1
could	1
be	1
set	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
exigencies;	1
that	1
a	1
power	1
equal	1
to	1
every	1
possible	1
contingency	1
must	1
exist	1
somewhere	1
in	1
the	1
government:	1
and	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
referred	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
that	1
power	1
to	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
they	1
had	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
ultimate	1
point	1
of	1
precaution	1
which	1
was	1
reconcilable	1
with	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
From	1
the	1
same	1
source,	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
derived	1
an	1
hereditary	1
impression	1
of	1
danger	1
to	1
liberty,	1
from	1
standing	1
armies	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace.	1
The	1
circumstances	1
of	1
a	1
revolution	1
quickened	1
the	1
public	1
sensibility	1
on	1
every	1
point	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
popular	1
rights,	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
instances	1
raise	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
our	1
zeal	1
beyond	1
the	1
degree	1
which	1
consisted	1
with	1
the	1
due	1
temperature	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
politic.	1
The	1
attempts	1
of	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
to	1
restrict	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
military	1
establishments,	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
these	1
instances.	1
The	1
principles	1
which	1
had	1
taught	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
jealous	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
an	1
hereditary	1
monarch	1
were	1
by	1
an	1
injudicious	1
excess	1
extended	1
to	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
popular	1
assemblies.	1
Even	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
where	1
this	1
error	1
was	1
not	1
adopted,	1
we	1
find	1
unnecessary	1
declarations	1
that	1
standing	1
armies	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
up,	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace,	1
WITHOUT	1
THE	1
CONSENT	1
OF	1
THE	1
LEGISLATURE.	1
I	1
call	1
them	1
unnecessary,	1
because	1
the	1
reason	1
which	1
had	1
introduced	1
a	1
similar	1
provision	1
into	1
the	1
English	1
Bill	1
of	1
Rights	1
is	1
not	1
applicable	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
raising	1
armies	1
at	1
all,	1
under	1
those	1
constitutions,	1
can	1
by	1
no	1
construction	1
be	1
deemed	1
to	1
reside	1
anywhere	1
else,	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
legislatures	1
themselves;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
superfluous,	1
if	1
not	1
absurd,	1
to	1
declare	1
that	1
a	1
matter	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
done	1
without	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
a	1
body,	1
which	1
alone	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
doing	1
it.	1
Accordingly,	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
constitutions,	1
and	1
among	1
others,	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
this	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
justly	1
celebrated,	1
both	1
in	1
Europe	1
and	1
America,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
government	1
established	1
in	1
this	1
country,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
total	1
silence	1
upon	1
the	1
subject.	1
It	1
is	1
remarkable,	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
States	1
which	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
meditated	1
an	1
interdiction	1
of	1
military	1
establishments	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace,	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
expression	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
is	1
rather	1
cautionary	1
than	1
prohibitory.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
said,	1
that	1
standing	1
armies	1
SHALL	1
NOT	1
BE	1
kept	1
up,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
OUGHT	1
NOT	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
up,	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace.	1
This	1
ambiguity	1
of	1
terms	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
a	1
conflict	1
between	1
jealousy	1
and	1
conviction;	1
between	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
excluding	1
such	1
establishments	1
at	1
all	1
events,	1
and	1
the	1
persuasion	1
that	1
an	1
absolute	1
exclusion	1
would	1
be	1
unwise	1
and	1
unsafe.	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
doubted	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
provision,	1
whenever	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
public	1
affairs	1
was	1
understood	1
to	1
require	1
a	1
departure	1
from	1
it,	1
would	1
be	1
interpreted	1
by	1
the	1
legislature	1
into	1
a	1
mere	1
admonition,	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
the	1
necessities	1
or	1
supposed	1
necessities	1
of	1
the	1
State?	1
Let	1
the	1
fact	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
Pennsylvania,	1
decide.	1
What	1
then	1
(it	1
may	1
be	1
asked)	1
is	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
provision,	1
if	1
it	1
cease	1
to	1
operate	1
the	1
moment	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
inclination	1
to	1
disregard	1
it?	1
Let	1
us	1
examine	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
comparison,	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
efficacy,	1
between	1
the	1
provision	1
alluded	1
to	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution,	1
for	1
restraining	1
the	1
appropriations	1
of	1
money	1
for	1
military	1
purposes	1
to	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
two	1
years.	1
The	1
former,	1
by	1
aiming	1
at	1
too	1
much,	1
is	1
calculated	1
to	1
effect	1
nothing;	1
the	1
latter,	1
by	1
steering	1
clear	1
of	1
an	1
imprudent	1
extreme,	1
and	1
by	1
being	1
perfectly	1
compatible	1
with	1
a	1
proper	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
exigencies	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
salutary	1
and	1
powerful	1
operation.	1
The	1
legislature	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
will	1
be	1
OBLIGED,	1
by	1
this	1
provision,	1
once	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
every	1
two	1
years,	1
to	1
deliberate	1
upon	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
keeping	1
a	1
military	1
force	1
on	1
foot;	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
new	1
resolution	1
on	1
the	1
point;	1
and	1
to	1
declare	1
their	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
by	1
a	1
formal	1
vote	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
their	1
constituents.	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
AT	1
LIBERTY	1
to	1
vest	1
in	1
the	1
executive	1
department	1
permanent	1
funds	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
an	1
army,	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
even	1
incautious	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
repose	1
in	1
it	1
so	1
improper	1
a	1
confidence.	1
As	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
party,	1
in	1
different	1
degrees,	1
must	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
infect	1
all	1
political	1
bodies,	1
there	1
will	1
be,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
persons	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
willing	1
enough	1
to	1
arraign	1
the	1
measures	1
and	1
criminate	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
majority.	1
The	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
a	1
military	1
force	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
a	1
favorable	1
topic	1
for	1
declamation.	1
As	1
often	1
as	1
the	1
question	1
comes	1
forward,	1
the	1
public	1
attention	1
will	1
be	1
roused	1
and	1
attracted	1
to	1
the	1
subject,	1
by	1
the	1
party	1
in	1
opposition;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
majority	1
should	1
be	1
really	1
disposed	1
to	1
exceed	1
the	1
proper	1
limits,	1
the	1
community	1
will	1
be	1
warned	1
of	1
the	1
danger,	1
and	1
will	1
have	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
taking	1
measures	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
it.	1
Independent	1
of	1
parties	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
itself,	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
discussion	1
arrived,	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
who	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
not	1
only	1
vigilant	1
but	1
suspicious	1
and	1
jealous	1
guardians	1
of	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
against	1
encroachments	1
from	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
will	1
constantly	1
have	1
their	1
attention	1
awake	1
to	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
rulers,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
ready	1
enough,	1
if	1
any	1
thing	1
improper	1
appears,	1
to	1
sound	1
the	1
alarm	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
VOICE,	1
but,	1
if	1
necessary,	1
the	1
ARM	1
of	1
their	1
discontent.	1
Schemes	1
to	1
subvert	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
community	1
REQUIRE	1
TIME	1
to	1
mature	1
them	1
for	1
execution.	1
An	1
army,	1
so	1
large	1
as	1
seriously	1
to	1
menace	1
those	1
liberties,	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
formed	1
by	1
progressive	1
augmentations;	1
which	1
would	1
suppose,	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
temporary	1
combination	1
between	1
the	1
legislature	1
and	1
executive,	1
but	1
a	1
continued	1
conspiracy	1
for	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
time.	1
Is	1
it	1
probable	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
combination	1
would	1
exist	1
at	1
all?	1
Is	1
it	1
probable	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
persevered	1
in,	1
and	1
transmitted	1
along	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
successive	1
variations	1
in	1
a	1
representative	1
body,	1
which	1
biennial	1
elections	1
would	1
naturally	1
produce	1
in	1
both	1
houses?	1
Is	1
it	1
presumable,	1
that	1
every	1
man,	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
Senate	1
or	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
would	1
commence	1
a	1
traitor	1
to	1
his	1
constituents	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
country?	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
found	1
one	1
man,	1
discerning	1
enough	1
to	1
detect	1
so	1
atrocious	1
a	1
conspiracy,	1
or	1
bold	1
or	1
honest	1
enough	1
to	1
apprise	1
his	1
constituents	1
of	1
their	1
danger?	1
If	1
such	1
presumptions	1
can	1
fairly	1
be	1
made,	1
there	1
ought	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
delegated	1
authority.	1
The	1
people	1
should	1
resolve	1
to	1
recall	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
they	1
have	1
heretofore	1
parted	1
with	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
hands,	1
and	1
to	1
divide	1
themselves	1
into	1
as	1
many	1
States	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
counties,	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
manage	1
their	1
own	1
concerns	1
in	1
person.	1
If	1
such	1
suppositions	1
could	1
even	1
be	1
reasonably	1
made,	1
still	1
the	1
concealment	1
of	1
the	1
design,	1
for	1
any	1
duration,	1
would	1
be	1
impracticable.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
announced,	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
circumstance	1
of	1
augmenting	1
the	1
army	1
to	1
so	1
great	1
an	1
extent	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
profound	1
peace.	1
What	1
colorable	1
reason	1
could	1
be	1
assigned,	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
so	1
situated,	1
for	1
such	1
vast	1
augmentations	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
force?	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
could	1
be	1
long	1
deceived;	1
and	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
project,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
projectors,	1
would	1
quickly	1
follow	1
the	1
discovery.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
provision	1
which	1
limits	1
the	1
appropriation	1
of	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
to	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
two	1
years	1
would	1
be	1
unavailing,	1
because	1
the	1
Executive,	1
when	1
once	1
possessed	1
of	1
a	1
force	1
large	1
enough	1
to	1
awe	1
the	1
people	1
into	1
submission,	1
would	1
find	1
resources	1
in	1
that	1
very	1
force	1
sufficient	1
to	1
enable	1
him	1
to	1
dispense	1
with	1
supplies	1
from	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
But	1
the	1
question	1
again	1
recurs,	1
upon	1
what	1
pretense	1
could	1
he	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
force	1
of	1
that	1
magnitude	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace?	1
If	1
we	1
suppose	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
created	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
some	1
domestic	1
insurrection	1
or	1
foreign	1
war,	1
then	1
it	1
becomes	1
a	1
case	1
not	1
within	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
objection;	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
levelled	1
against	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
keeping	1
up	1
troops	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace.	1
Few	1
persons	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
visionary	1
as	1
seriously	1
to	1
contend	1
that	1
military	1
forces	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
raised	1
to	1
quell	1
a	1
rebellion	1
or	1
resist	1
an	1
invasion;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances	1
should	1
make	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
army	1
so	1
numerous	1
as	1
to	1
hazard	1
its	1
liberty,	1
this	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
calamaties	1
for	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
preventative	1
nor	1
cure.	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
provided	1
against	1
by	1
any	1
possible	1
form	1
of	1
government;	1
it	1
might	1
even	1
result	1
from	1
a	1
simple	1
league	1
offensive	1
and	1
defensive,	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
ever	1
be	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
confederates	1
or	1
allies	1
to	1
form	1
an	1
army	1
for	1
common	1
defense.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
infinitely	1
less	1
likely	1
to	1
attend	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
united	1
than	1
in	1
a	1
disunited	1
state;	1
nay,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
safely	1
asserted	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
altogether	1
unlikely	1
to	1
attend	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
situation.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
conceive	1
a	1
possibility	1
that	1
dangers	1
so	1
formidable	1
can	1
assail	1
the	1
whole	1
Union,	1
as	1
to	1
demand	1
a	1
force	1
considerable	1
enough	1
to	1
place	1
our	1
liberties	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
jeopardy,	1
especially	1
if	1
we	1
take	1
into	1
our	1
view	1
the	1
aid	1
to	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
militia,	1
which	1
ought	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
counted	1
upon	1
as	1
a	1
valuable	1
and	1
powerful	1
auxiliary.	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
disunion	1
(as	1
has	1
been	1
fully	1
shown	1
in	1
another	1
place),	1
the	1
contrary	1
of	1
this	1
supposition	1
would	1
become	1
not	1
only	1
probable,	1
but	1
almost	1
unavoidable.	1

The	1

Subject	1
Continued	1
(The	1
Idea	1
of	1
Restraining	1

Regard	1
to	1

From	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
IT	1
HAS	1
been	1
urged,	1
in	1
different	1
shapes,	1
that	1
a	1
Constitution	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
proposed	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
cannot	1
operate	1
without	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
a	1
military	1
force	1
to	1
execute	1
its	1
laws.	1
This,	1
however,	1
like	1
most	1
other	1
things	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
alleged	1
on	1
that	1
side,	1
rests	1
on	1
mere	1
general	1
assertion,	1
unsupported	1
by	1
any	1
precise	1
or	1
intelligible	1
designation	1
of	1
the	1
reasons	1
upon	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
founded.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
divine	1
the	1
latent	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
objectors,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
originate	1
in	1
a	1
presupposition	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
be	1
disinclined	1
to	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
federal	1
authority	1
in	1
any	1
matter	1
of	1
an	1
internal	1
nature.	1
Waiving	1
any	1
exception	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
the	1
inaccuracy	1
or	1
inexplicitness	1
of	1
the	1
distinction	1
between	1
internal	1
and	1
external,	1
let	1
us	1
inquire	1
what	1
ground	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
presuppose	1
that	1
disinclination	1
in	1
the	1
people.	1
Unless	1
we	1
presume	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
will	1
be	1
worse	1
administered	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
government,	1
there	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
presumption	1
of	1
ill-will,	1
disaffection,	1
or	1
opposition	1
in	1
the	1
people.	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
laid	1
down	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
rule	1
that	1
their	1
confidence	1
in	1
and	1
obedience	1
to	1
a	1
government	1
will	1
commonly	1
be	1
proportioned	1
to	1
the	1
goodness	1
or	1
badness	1
of	1
its	1
administration.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
admitted	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
exceptions	1
to	1
this	1
rule;	1
but	1
these	1
exceptions	1
depend	1
so	1
entirely	1
on	1
accidental	1
causes,	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
having	1
any	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
intrinsic	1
merits	1
or	1
demerits	1
of	1
a	1
constitution.	1
These	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
judged	1
of	1
by	1
general	1
principles	1
and	1
maxims.	1
Various	1
reasons	1
have	1
been	1
suggested,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
papers,	1
to	1
induce	1
a	1
probability	1
that	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
administered	1
than	1
the	1
particular	1
governments;	1
the	1
principal	1
of	1
which	1
reasons	1
are	1
that	1
the	1
extension	1
of	1
the	1
spheres	1
of	1
election	1
will	1
present	1
a	1
greater	1
option,	1
or	1
latitude	1
of	1
choice,	1
to	1
the	1
people;	1
that	1
through	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
which	1
are	1
select	1
bodies	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
appoint	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
Senate	1
there	1
is	1
reason	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
this	1
branch	1
will	1
generally	1
be	1
composed	1
with	1
peculiar	1
care	1
and	1
judgment;	1
that	1
these	1
circumstances	1
promise	1
greater	1
knowledge	1
and	1
more	1
extensive	1
information	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
councils,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
less	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
tainted	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
faction,	1
and	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
those	1
occasional	1
ill-humors,	1
or	1
temporary	1
prejudices	1
and	1
propensities,	1
which,	1
in	1
smaller	1
societies,	1
frequently	1
contaminate	1
the	1
public	1
councils,	1
beget	1
injustice	1
and	1
oppression	1
of	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
community,	1
and	1
engender	1
schemes	1
which,	1
though	1
they	1
gratify	1
a	1
momentary	1
inclination	1
or	1
desire,	1
terminate	1
in	1
general	1
distress,	1
dissatisfaction,	1
and	1
disgust.	1
Several	1
additional	1
reasons	1
of	1
considerable	1
force,	1
to	1
fortify	1
that	1
probability,	1
will	1
occur	1
when	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
survey,	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
critical	1
eye,	1
the	1
interior	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
edifice	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
invited	1
to	1
erect.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
sufficient	1
here	1
to	1
remark,	1
that	1
until	1
satisfactory	1
reasons	1
can	1
be	1
assigned	1
to	1
justify	1
an	1
opinion,	1
that	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
administered	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
it	1
odious	1
or	1
contemptible	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
reasonable	1
foundation	1
for	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
will	1
meet	1
with	1
any	1
greater	1
obstruction	1
from	1
them,	1
or	1
will	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
methods	1
to	1
enforce	1
their	1
execution,	1
than	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
members.	1
The	1
hope	1
of	1
impunity	1
is	1
a	1
strong	1
incitement	1
to	1
sedition;	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
punishment,	1
a	1
proportionably	1
strong	1
discouragement	1
to	1
it.	1
Will	1
not	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
which,	1
if	1
possessed	1
of	1
a	1
due	1
degree	1
of	1
power,	1
can	1
call	1
to	1
its	1
aid	1
the	1
collective	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
Confederacy,	1
be	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
repress	1
the	1
FORMER	1
sentiment	1
and	1
to	1
inspire	1
the	1
LATTER,	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
State,	1
which	1
can	1
only	1
command	1
the	1
resources	1
within	1
itself?	1
A	1
turbulent	1
faction	1
in	1
a	1
State	1
may	1
easily	1
suppose	1
itself	1
able	1
to	1
contend	1
with	1
the	1
friends	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
in	1
that	1
State;	1
but	1
it	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
so	1
infatuated	1
as	1
to	1
imagine	1
itself	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
the	1
combined	1
efforts	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
If	1
this	1
reflection	1
be	1
just,	1
there	1
is	1
less	1
danger	1
of	1
resistance	1
from	1
irregular	1
combinations	1
of	1
individuals	1
to	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy	1
than	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
member.	1
I	1
will,	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
hazard	1
an	1
observation,	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
less	1
just	1
because	1
to	1
some	1
it	1
may	1
appear	1
new;	1
which	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
authority	1
are	1
intermingled	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
exercise	1
of	1
government,	1
the	1
more	1
the	1
citizens	1
are	1
accustomed	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
occurrences	1
of	1
their	1
political	1
life,	1
the	1
more	1
it	1
is	1
familiarized	1
to	1
their	1
sight	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
feelings,	1
the	1
further	1
it	1
enters	1
into	1
those	1
objects	1
which	1
touch	1
the	1
most	1
sensible	1
chords	1
and	1
put	1
in	1
motion	1
the	1
most	1
active	1
springs	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
heart,	1
the	1
greater	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
probability	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
conciliate	1
the	1
respect	1
and	1
attachment	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
Man	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
a	1
creature	1
of	1
habit.	1
A	1
thing	1
that	1
rarely	1
strikes	1
his	1
senses	1
will	1
generally	1
have	1
but	1
little	1
influence	1
upon	1
his	1
mind.	1
A	1
government	1
continually	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
interest	1
the	1
sensations	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
The	1
inference	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
the	1
affections	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
towards	1
it,	1
will	1
be	1
strengthened,	1
rather	1
than	1
weakened,	1
by	1
its	1
extension	1
to	1
what	1
are	1
called	1
matters	1
of	1
internal	1
concern;	1
and	1
will	1
have	1
less	1
occasion	1
to	1
recur	1
to	1
force,	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
familiarity	1
and	1
comprehensiveness	1
of	1
its	1
agency.	1
The	1
more	1
it	1
circulates	1
through	1
those	1
channels	1
and	1
currents	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
passions	1
of	1
mankind	1
naturally	1
flow,	1
the	1
less	1
will	1
it	1
require	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
the	1
violent	1
and	1
perilous	1
expedients	1
of	1
compulsion.	1
One	1
thing,	1
at	1
all	1
events,	1
must	1
be	1
evident,	1
that	1
a	1
government	1
like	1
the	1
one	1
proposed	1
would	1
bid	1
much	1
fairer	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
using	1
force,	1
than	1
that	1
species	1
of	1
league	1
contend	1
for	1
by	1
most	1
of	1
its	1
opponents;	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
which	1
should	1
only	1
operate	1
upon	1
the	1
States	1
in	1
their	1
political	1
or	1
collective	1
capacities.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
shown	1
that	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
Confederacy	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
sanction	1
for	1
the	1
laws	1
but	1
force;	1
that	1
frequent	1
delinquencies	1
in	1
the	1
members	1
are	1
the	1
natural	1
offspring	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
frame	1
of	1
the	1
government;	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
these	1
happen,	1
they	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
redressed,	1
if	1
at	1
all,	1
by	1
war	1
and	1
violence.	1
The	1
plan	1
reported	1
by	1
the	1
convention,	1
by	1
extending	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
individual	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
will	1
enable	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
employ	1
the	1
ordinary	1
magistracy	1
of	1
each,	1
in	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
its	1
laws.	1
It	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
tend	1
to	1
destroy,	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
apprehension,	1
all	1
distinction	1
between	1
the	1
sources	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
might	1
proceed;	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
the	1
same	1
advantage	1
for	1
securing	1
a	1
due	1
obedience	1
to	1
its	1
authority	1
which	1
is	1
enjoyed	1
by	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
each	1
State,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
influence	1
on	1
public	1
opinion	1
which	1
will	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
important	1
consideration	1
of	1
its	1
having	1
power	1
to	1
call	1
to	1
its	1
assistance	1
and	1
support	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
Union.	1
It	1
merits	1
particular	1
attention	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
that	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
ENUMERATED	1
and	1
LEGITIMATE	1
objects	1
of	1
its	1
jurisdiction,	1
will	1
become	1
the	1
SUPREME	1
LAW	1
of	1
the	1
land;	1
to	1
the	1
observance	1
of	1
which	1
all	1
officers,	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judicial,	1
in	1
each	1
State,	1
will	1
be	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
sanctity	1
of	1
an	1
oath.	1
Thus	1
the	1
legislatures,	1
courts,	1
and	1
magistrates,	1
of	1
the	1
respective	1
members,	1
will	1
be	1
incorporated	1
into	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
AS	1
FAR	1
AS	1
ITS	1
JUST	1
AND	1
CONSTITUTIONAL	1
AUTHORITY	1

and	1
will	1
be	1

the	1
enforcement	1
of	1
its	1

the	1

will	1

If	1

we	1
may	1

from	1
the	1

it	1

the	1

cannot	1
be	1

Our	1
own	1
experience	1
has	1
corroborated	1
the	1
lessons	1
taught	1
by	1
the	1
examples	1
of	1
other	1
nations;	1
that	1
emergencies	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
will	1
sometimes	1
arise	1
in	1
all	1
societies,	1
however	1
constituted;	1
that	1
seditions	1
and	1
insurrections	1
are,	1
unhappily,	1
maladies	1
as	1
inseparable	1
from	1
the	1
body	1
politic	1
as	1
tumors	1
and	1
eruptions	1
from	1
the	1
natural	1
body;	1
that	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
governing	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
by	1
the	1
simple	1
force	1
of	1
law	1
(which	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
told	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
admissible	1
principle	1
of	1
republican	1
government),	1
has	1
no	1
place	1

in	1
the	1

of	1
those	1
political	1
doctors	1
whose	1
sagacity	1
disdains	1
the	1
admonitions	1
of	1
experimental	1
instruction.	1
Should	1
such	1
emergencies	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
happen	1
under	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
remedy	1
but	1
force.	1
The	1
means	1
to	1
be	1
employed	1
must	1
be	1
proportioned	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
mischief.	1
If	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
slight	1
commotion	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
State,	1
the	1
militia	1
of	1
the	1
residue	1
would	1
be	1
adequate	1
to	1
its	1
suppression;	1
and	1
the	1
national	1
presumption	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
do	1
their	1
duty.	1
An	1
insurrection,	1
whatever	1
may	1
be	1
its	1
immediate	1
cause,	1
eventually	1
endangers	1
all	1
government.	1
Regard	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
peace,	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1

would	1
engage	1
the	1
citizens	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
contagion	1
had	1
not	1
communicated	1
itself	1
to	1
oppose	1
the	1

if	1

be	1
found	1
in	1
practice	1
conducive	1
to	1
the	1

it	1

a	1
principal	1
part	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
employment	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
kind	1
of	1
force	1
might	1
become	1
unavoidable.	1
It	1
appears	1
that	1
Massachusetts	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
raise	1
troops	1
for	1
repressing	1
the	1
disorders	1
within	1
that	1
State;	1
that	1
Pennsylvania,	1
from	1
the	1
mere	1
apprehension	1
of	1
commotions	1
among	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
citizens,	1
has	1
thought	1
proper	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
measure.	1
Suppose	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
had	1
been	1
inclined	1
to	1
re-establish	1
her	1
lost	1
jurisdiction	1
over	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
Vermont,	1
could	1
she	1
have	1
hoped	1
for	1
success	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
enterprise	1
from	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
alone?	1
Would	1
she	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
compelled	1
to	1
raise	1
and	1
to	1
maintain	1
a	1
more	1
regular	1
force	1
for	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
her	1
design?	1
If	1
it	1
must	1
then	1
be	1
admitted	1
that	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
recurring	1
to	1
a	1
force	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
militia,	1
in	1
cases	1
of	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
nature,	1
is	1
applicable	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
themselves,	1
why	1
should	1
the	1
possibility,	1
that	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
might	1
be	1
under	1
a	1
like	1
necessity,	1
in	1
similar	1
extremities,	1
be	1
made	1
an	1
objection	1
to	1
its	1
existence?	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
surprising	1
that	1
men	1
who	1
declare	1
an	1
attachment	1
to	1
the	1
Union	1
in	1
the	1
abstract,	1
should	1
urge	1
as	1
an	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
what	1
applies	1
with	1
tenfold	1
weight	1
to	1
the	1
plan	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
contend;	1
and	1
what,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
any	1
foundation	1
in	1
truth,	1
is	1
an	1
inevitable	1
consequence	1
of	1
civil	1
society	1
upon	1
an	1
enlarged	1
scale?	1
Who	1
would	1
not	1
prefer	1
that	1
possibility	1
to	1
the	1
unceasing	1
agitations	1
and	1
frequent	1
revolutions	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
continual	1
scourges	1
of	1
petty	1
republics?	1
Let	1
us	1
pursue	1
this	1
examination	1
in	1
another	1
light.	1
Suppose,	1
in	1
lieu	1
of	1
one	1
general	1
system,	1
two,	1
or	1
three,	1
or	1
even	1
four	1
Confederacies	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
formed,	1
would	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
difficulty	1
oppose	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
either	1
of	1
these	1
Confederacies?	1
Would	1
not	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
casualties;	1
and	1
when	1
these	1
happened,	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
expedients	1
for	1
upholding	1
its	1
authority	1
which	1
are	1
objected	1
to	1
in	1
a	1
government	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
States?	1
Would	1
the	1
militia,	1
in	1
this	1
supposition,	1
be	1
more	1
ready	1
or	1
more	1
able	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
federal	1
authority	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
union?	1
All	1
candid	1
and	1
intelligent	1
men	1
must,	1
upon	1
due	1
consideration,	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
the	1
objection	1
is	1
equally	1
applicable	1
to	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
cases;	1
and	1
that	1
whether	1
we	1
have	1
one	1
government	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
States,	1
or	1
different	1
governments	1
for	1
different	1
parcels	1
of	1
them,	1
or	1
even	1
if	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
an	1
entire	1
separation	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
there	1
might	1
sometimes	1
be	1
a	1
necessity	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
a	1
force	1
constituted	1
differently	1
from	1
the	1
militia,	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
and	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
just	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
against	1
those	1
violent	1
invasions	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
amount	1
to	1
insurrections	1
and	1
rebellions.	1
Independent	1
of	1
all	1
other	1
reasonings	1
upon	1
the	1
subject,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
full	1
answer	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
require	1
a	1
more	1
peremptory	1
provision	1
against	1
military	1
establishments	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace,	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
government	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
essential,	1
and,	1
after	1
all,	1
only	1
efficacious	1
security	1
for	1
the	1
rights	1
and	1
privileges	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
which	1
is	1
attainable	1
in	1
civil	1
society.	1
[1]	1
If	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
betray	1
their	1
constituents,	1
there	1
is	1
then	1
no	1
resource	1
left	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
exertion	1
of	1
that	1
original	1
right	1
of	1
self-defense	1
which	1
is	1
paramount	1
to	1
all	1
positive	1
forms	1
of	1
government,	1
and	1
which	1
against	1
the	1
usurpations	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
rulers,	1
may	1
be	1
exerted	1
with	1
infinitely	1
better	1
prospect	1
of	1
success	1
than	1
against	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
an	1
individual	1
state.	1
In	1
a	1
single	1
state,	1
if	1
the	1
persons	1
intrusted	1
with	1
supreme	1
power	1
become	1
usurpers,	1
the	1
different	1
parcels,	1
subdivisions,	1
or	1
districts	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
consists,	1
having	1
no	1
distinct	1
government	1
in	1
each,	1
can	1
take	1
no	1
regular	1
measures	1
for	1
defense.	1
The	1
citizens	1
must	1
rush	1
tumultuously	1
to	1
arms,	1
without	1
concert,	1
without	1
system,	1
without	1
resource;	1
except	1
in	1
their	1
courage	1
and	1
despair.	1
The	1
usurpers,	1
clothed	1
with	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
legal	1
authority,	1
can	1
too	1
often	1
crush	1
the	1
opposition	1
in	1
embryo.	1
The	1
smaller	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
territory,	1
the	1
more	1
difficult	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
regular	1
or	1
systematic	1
plan	1
of	1
opposition,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
easy	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
defeat	1
their	1
early	1
efforts.	1
Intelligence	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
speedily	1
obtained	1
of	1
their	1
preparations	1
and	1
movements,	1
and	1
the	1
military	1
force	1
in	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
usurpers	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
rapidly	1
directed	1
against	1
the	1
part	1
where	1
the	1
opposition	1
has	1
begun.	1
In	1
this	1
situation	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
peculiar	1
coincidence	1
of	1
circumstances	1
to	1
insure	1
success	1
to	1
the	1
popular	1
resistance.	1
The	1
obstacles	1
to	1
usurpation	1
and	1
the	1
facilities	1
of	1
resistance	1
increase	1
with	1
the	1
increased	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
state,	1
provided	1
the	1
citizens	1
understand	1
their	1
rights	1
and	1
are	1
disposed	1
to	1
defend	1
them.	1
The	1
natural	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
community,	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
artificial	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
in	1
a	1
small,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
more	1
competent	1
to	1
a	1
struggle	1
with	1
the	1
attempts	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
establish	1
a	1
tyranny.	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
confederacy	1
the	1
people,	1
without	1
exaggeration,	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
the	1
masters	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
fate.	1
Power	1
being	1
almost	1
always	1
the	1
rival	1
of	1
power,	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
will	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
stand	1
ready	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
usurpations	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
governments,	1
and	1
these	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
disposition	1
towards	1
the	1
general	1
government.	1
The	1
people,	1
by	1
throwing	1
themselves	1
into	1
either	1
scale,	1
will	1
infallibly	1
make	1
it	1
preponderate.	1
If	1
their	1
rights	1
are	1
invaded	1
by	1
either,	1
they	1
can	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
as	1
the	1
instrument	1
of	1
redress.	1
How	1
wise	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
them	1
by	1
cherishing	1
the	1
union	1
to	1
preserve	1
to	1
themselves	1
an	1
advantage	1
which	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
too	1
highly	1
prized!	1
It	1
may	1
safely	1
be	1
received	1
as	1
an	1
axiom	1
in	1
our	1
political	1
system,	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
will,	1
in	1
all	1
possible	1
contingencies,	1
afford	1
complete	1
security	1
against	1
invasions	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
liberty	1
by	1
the	1
national	1
authority.	1
Projects	1
of	1
usurpation	1
cannot	1
be	1
masked	1
under	1
pretenses	1
so	1
likely	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
penetration	1
of	1
select	1
bodies	1
of	1
men,	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large.	1
The	1
legislatures	1
will	1
have	1
better	1
means	1
of	1
information.	1
They	1
can	1
discover	1
the	1
danger	1
at	1
a	1
distance;	1
and	1
possessing	1
all	1
the	1
organs	1
of	1
civil	1
power,	1
and	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
they	1
can	1
at	1
once	1
adopt	1
a	1
regular	1
plan	1
of	1
opposition,	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
can	1
combine	1
all	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
They	1
can	1
readily	1
communicate	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
different	1
States,	1
and	1
unite	1
their	1
common	1
forces	1
for	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
their	1
common	1
liberty.	1
The	1
great	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
is	1
a	1
further	1
security.	1
We	1
have	1
already	1
experienced	1
its	1
utility	1
against	1
the	1
attacks	1
of	1
a	1
foreign	1
power.	1
And	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
effect	1
against	1
the	1
enterprises	1
of	1
ambitious	1
rulers	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
councils.	1
If	1
the	1
federal	1
army	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
quell	1
the	1
resistance	1
of	1
one	1
State,	1
the	1
distant	1
States	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
in	1
their	1
power	1
to	1
make	1
head	1
with	1
fresh	1
forces.	1
The	1
advantages	1
obtained	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
must	1
be	1
abandoned	1
to	1
subdue	1
the	1
opposition	1
in	1
others;	1
and	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
part	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
reduced	1
to	1
submission	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
itself,	1
its	1
efforts	1
would	1
be	1
renewed,	1
and	1
its	1
resistance	1
revive.	1
We	1
should	1
recollect	1
that	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
force	1
must,	1
at	1
all	1
events,	1
be	1
regulated	1
by	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
possible	1
to	1
maintain	1
a	1
large	1
army;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
doing	1
this	1
increase,	1
the	1
population	1
and	1
natural	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
will	1
proportionably	1
increase.	1
When	1
will	1
the	1
time	1
arrive	1
that	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
can	1
raise	1
and	1
maintain	1
an	1
army	1
capable	1
of	1
erecting	1
a	1
despotism	1
over	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
an	1
immense	1
empire,	1
who	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
situation,	1
through	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
their	1
State	1
governments,	1
to	1
take	1
measures	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
defense,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
celerity,	1
regularity,	1
and	1
system	1
of	1
independent	1
nations?	1
The	1
apprehension	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
disease,	1
for	1
which	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
found	1
no	1
cure	1
in	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
argument	1

From	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
power	1
of	1
regulating	1
the	1
militia,	1
and	1
of	1
commanding	1
its	1
services	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
insurrection	1
and	1
invasion	1
are	1
natural	1
incidents	1
to	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
superintending	1
the	1
common	1
defense,	1
and	1
of	1
watching	1
over	1
the	1
internal	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy.	1
It	1
requires	1
no	1
skill	1
in	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
war	1
to	1
discern	1
that	1
uniformity	1
in	1
the	1
organization	1
and	1
discipline	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
would	1
be	1
attended	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
beneficial	1
effects,	1
whenever	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
into	1
service	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
defense.	1
It	1
would	1
enable	1
them	1
to	1
discharge	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
the	1
camp	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
with	1
mutual	1
intelligence	1
and	1
concert	1
an	1
advantage	1
of	1
peculiar	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
an	1
army;	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
fit	1
them	1
much	1
sooner	1
to	1
acquire	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
proficiency	1
in	1
military	1
functions	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
essential	1
to	1
their	1
usefulness.	1
This	1
desirable	1
uniformity	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
accomplished	1
by	1
confiding	1
the	1
regulation	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
to	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
authority.	1
It	1
is,	1
therefore,	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
evident	1
propriety,	1
that	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
proposes	1
to	1
empower	1
the	1
Union	1
"to	1
provide	1
for	1
organizing,	1
arming,	1
and	1
disciplining	1
the	1
militia,	1
and	1
for	1
governing	1
such	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
RESERVING	1
TO	1
THE	1
STATES	1
RESPECTIVELY	1
THE	1
APPOINTMENT	1
OF	1
THE	1
OFFICERS,	1
AND	1
THE	1
AUTHORITY	1
OF	1
TRAINING	1
THE	1
MILITIA	1
ACCORDING	1
TO	1
THE	1
DISCIPLINE	1
PRESCRIBED	1
BY	1
CONGRESS."	1
Of	1
the	1
different	1
grounds	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
little	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
expected,	1
or	1
is	1
so	1
untenable	1
in	1
itself,	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
from	1
which	1
this	1
particular	1
provision	1
has	1
been	1
attacked.	1
If	1
a	1
well-regulated	1
militia	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
natural	1
defense	1
of	1
a	1
free	1
country,	1
it	1
ought	1
certainly	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
regulation	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
that	1
body	1
which	1
is	1
constituted	1
the	1
guardian	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
security.	1
If	1
standing	1
armies	1
are	1
dangerous	1
to	1
liberty,	1
an	1
efficacious	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
militia,	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
whose	1
care	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
is	1
committed,	1
ought,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible,	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
inducement	1
and	1
the	1
pretext	1
to	1
such	1
unfriendly	1
institutions.	1
If	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
can	1
command	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
in	1
those	1
emergencies	1
which	1
call	1
for	1
the	1
military	1
arm	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
civil	1
magistrate,	1
it	1
can	1
the	1
better	1
dispense	1
with	1
the	1
employment	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
kind	1
of	1
force.	1
If	1
it	1
cannot	1
avail	1
itself	1
of	1
the	1
former,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
recur	1
to	1
the	1
latter.	1
To	1
render	1
an	1
army	1
unnecessary,	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
more	1
certain	1
method	1
of	1
preventing	1
its	1
existence	1
than	1
a	1
thousand	1
prohibitions	1
upon	1
paper.	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
cast	1
an	1
odium	1
upon	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
calling	1
forth	1
the	1
militia	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
remarked	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nowhere	1
any	1
provision	1
in	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
for	1
calling	1
out	1
the	1
POSSE	1
COMITATUS,	1
to	1
assist	1
the	1
magistrate	1
in	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
his	1
duty,	1
whence	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
inferred,	1
that	1
military	1
force	1
was	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
only	1
auxiliary.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
striking	1
incoherence	1
in	1
the	1
objections	1
which	1
have	1
appeared,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
quarter,	1
not	1
much	1
calculated	1
to	1
inspire	1
a	1
very	1
favorable	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
sincerity	1
or	1
fair	1
dealing	1
of	1
their	1
authors.	1
The	1
same	1
persons	1
who	1
tell	1
us	1
in	1
one	1
breath,	1
that	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
will	1
be	1
despotic	1
and	1
unlimited,	1
inform	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
next,	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
authority	1
sufficient	1
even	1
to	1
call	1
out	1
the	1
POSSE	1
COMITATUS.	1
The	1
latter,	1
fortunately,	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
as	1
the	1
former	1
exceeds	1
it.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
absurd	1
to	1
doubt,	1
that	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
pass	1
all	1
laws	1
NECESSARY	1
AND	1
PROPER	1
to	1
execute	1
its	1
declared	1
powers,	1
would	1
include	1
that	1
of	1
requiring	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
to	1
the	1
officers	1
who	1
may	1
be	1
intrusted	1
with	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
those	1
laws,	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
believe,	1
that	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
enact	1
laws	1
necessary	1
and	1
proper	1
for	1
the	1
imposition	1
and	1
collection	1
of	1
taxes	1
would	1
involve	1
that	1
of	1
varying	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
descent	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
alienation	1
of	1
landed	1
property,	1
or	1
of	1
abolishing	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
cases	1
relating	1
to	1
it.	1
It	1
being	1
therefore	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
supposition	1
of	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
power	1
to	1
require	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
the	1
POSSE	1
COMITATUS	1
is	1
entirely	1
destitute	1
of	1
color,	1
it	1
will	1
follow,	1
that	1
the	1
conclusion	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
drawn	1
from	1
it,	1
in	1
its	1
application	1
to	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
over	1
the	1
militia,	1
is	1
as	1
uncandid	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
illogical.	1
What	1
reason	1
could	1
there	1
be	1
to	1
infer,	1
that	1
force	1
was	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
sole	1
instrument	1
of	1
authority,	1
merely	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
power	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
it	1
when	1
necessary?	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
motives	1
which	1
could	1
induce	1
men	1
of	1
sense	1
to	1
reason	1
in	1
this	1
manner?	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
prevent	1
a	1
conflict	1
between	1
charity	1
and	1
judgment?	1
By	1
a	1
curious	1
refinement	1
upon	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
republican	1
jealousy,	1
we	1
are	1
even	1
taught	1
to	1
apprehend	1
danger	1
from	1
the	1
militia	1
itself,	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government.	1
It	1
is	1
observed	1
that	1
select	1
corps	1
may	1
be	1
formed,	1
composed	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
and	1
ardent,	1
who	1
may	1
be	1
rendered	1
subservient	1
to	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
arbitrary	1
power.	1
What	1
plan	1
for	1
the	1
regulation	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
may	1
be	1
pursued	1
by	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
be	1
foreseen.	1
But	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
viewing	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
light	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
object	1
to	1
select	1
corps	1
as	1
dangerous,	1
were	1
the	1
Constitution	1
ratified,	1
and	1
were	1
I	1
to	1
deliver	1
my	1
sentiments	1
to	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
legislature	1
from	1
this	1
State	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
a	1
militia	1
establishment,	1
I	1
should	1
hold	1
to	1
him,	1
in	1
substance,	1
the	1
following	1
discourse:	1
"The	1
project	1
of	1
disciplining	1
all	1
the	1
militia	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
is	1
as	1
futile	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
injurious,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
capable	1
of	1
being	1
carried	1
into	1
execution.	1
A	1
tolerable	1
expertness	1
in	1
military	1
movements	1
is	1
a	1
business	1
that	1
requires	1
time	1
and	1
practice.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
day,	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
week,	1
that	1
will	1
suffice	1
for	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
it.	1
To	1
oblige	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
yeomanry,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
classes	1
of	1
the	1
citizens,	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
arms	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
going	1
through	1
military	1
exercises	1
and	1
evolutions,	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
acquire	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
perfection	1
which	1
would	1
entitle	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
a	1
well-regulated	1
militia,	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
real	1
grievance	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
a	1
serious	1
public	1
inconvenience	1
and	1
loss.	1
It	1
would	1
form	1
an	1
annual	1
deduction	1
from	1
the	1
productive	1
labor	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
to	1
an	1
amount	1
which,	1
calculating	1
upon	1
the	1
present	1
numbers	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
would	1
not	1
fall	1
far	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
expense	1
of	1
the	1
civil	1
establishments	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
States.	1
To	1
attempt	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
would	1
abridge	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
labor	1
and	1
industry	1
to	1
so	1
considerable	1
an	1
extent,	1
would	1
be	1
unwise:	1
and	1
the	1
experiment,	1
if	1
made,	1
could	1
not	1
succeed,	1
because	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
long	1
be	1
endured.	1
Little	1
more	1
can	1
reasonably	1
be	1
aimed	1
at,	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large,	1
than	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
properly	1
armed	1
and	1
equipped;	1
and	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
this	1
be	1
not	1
neglected,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
assemble	1
them	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
year.	1
"But	1
though	1
the	1
scheme	1
of	1
disciplining	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
must	1
be	1
abandoned	1
as	1
mischievous	1
or	1
impracticable;	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
importance	1
that	1
a	1
well-digested	1
plan	1
should,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible,	1
be	1
adopted	1
for	1
the	1
proper	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
militia.	1
The	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
ought	1
particularly	1
to	1
be	1
directed	1
to	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
a	1
select	1
corps	1
of	1
moderate	1
extent,	1
upon	1
such	1
principles	1
as	1
will	1
really	1
fit	1
them	1
for	1
service	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
need.	1
By	1
thus	1
circumscribing	1
the	1
plan,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
possible	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
excellent	1
body	1
of	1
well-trained	1
militia,	1
ready	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
field	1
whenever	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
shall	1
require	1
it.	1
This	1
will	1
not	1
only	1
lessen	1
the	1
call	1
for	1
military	1
establishments,	1
but	1
if	1
circumstances	1
should	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
oblige	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
form	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
any	1
magnitude	1
that	1
army	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
formidable	1
to	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
while	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
large	1
body	1
of	1
citizens,	1
little,	1
if	1
at	1
all,	1
inferior	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
discipline	1
and	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
arms,	1
who	1
stand	1
ready	1
to	1
defend	1
their	1
own	1
rights	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
their	1
fellow-citizens.	1
This	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
only	1
substitute	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
devised	1
for	1
a	1
standing	1
army,	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
possible	1
security	1
against	1
it,	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
exist."	1
Thus	1
differently	1
from	1
the	1
adversaries	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
should	1
I	1
reason	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
subject,	1
deducing	1
arguments	1
of	1
safety	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
sources	1
which	1
they	1
represent	1
as	1
fraught	1
with	1
danger	1
and	1
perdition.	1
But	1
how	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
may	1
reason	1
on	1
the	1
point,	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
neither	1
they	1
nor	1
I	1
can	1
foresee.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
so	1
far-fetched	1
and	1
so	1
extravagant	1
in	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
danger	1
to	1
liberty	1
from	1
the	1
militia,	1
that	1
one	1
is	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
whether	1
to	1
treat	1
it	1
with	1
gravity	1
or	1
with	1
raillery;	1
whether	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
mere	1
trial	1
of	1
skill,	1
like	1
the	1
paradoxes	1
of	1
rhetoricians;	1
as	1
a	1
disingenuous	1
artifice	1
to	1
instil	1
prejudices	1
at	1
any	1
price;	1
or	1
as	1
the	1
serious	1
offspring	1
of	1
political	1
fanaticism.	1
Where	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
common-sense,	1
are	1
our	1
fears	1
to	1
end	1
if	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
trust	1
our	1
sons,	1
our	1
brothers,	1
our	1
neighbors,	1
our	1
fellow-citizens?	1
What	1
shadow	1
of	1
danger	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
from	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
daily	1
mingling	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
their	1
countrymen	1
and	1
who	1
participate	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
feelings,	1
sentiments,	1
habits	1
and	1
interests?	1
What	1
reasonable	1
cause	1
of	1
apprehension	1
can	1
be	1
inferred	1
from	1
a	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
Union	1
to	1
prescribe	1
regulations	1
for	1
the	1
militia,	1
and	1
to	1
command	1
its	1
services	1
when	1
necessary,	1
while	1
the	1
particular	1
States	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
SOLE	1
AND	1
EXCLUSIVE	1
APPOINTMENT	1
OF	1
THE	1
OFFICERS?	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
seriously	1
to	1
indulge	1
a	1
jealousy	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
upon	1
any	1
conceivable	1
establishment	1
under	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
ought	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
extinguish	1
it.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
this	1
circumstance	1
will	1
always	1
secure	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
preponderating	1
influence	1
over	1
the	1
militia.	1
In	1
reading	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
publications	1
against	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
perusing	1
some	1
ill-written	1
tale	1
or	1
romance,	1
which	1
instead	1
of	1
natural	1
and	1
agreeable	1
images,	1
exhibits	1
to	1
the	1
mind	1
nothing	1
but	1
frightful	1
and	1
distorted	1
shapes	1
"Gorgons,	1
hydras,	1
and	1
chimeras	1
dire";	1
discoloring	1
and	1
disfiguring	1
whatever	1
it	1
represents,	1
and	1
transforming	1
everything	1
it	1
touches	1
into	1
a	1
monster.	1
A	1
sample	1
of	1
this	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
in	1
the	1
exaggerated	1
and	1
improbable	1
suggestions	1
which	1
have	1
taken	1
place	1
respecting	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
calling	1
for	1
the	1
services	1
of	1
the	1
militia.	1
That	1
of	1
New	1
Hampshire	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
marched	1
to	1
Georgia,	1
of	1
Georgia	1
to	1
New	1
Hampshire,	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
to	1
Kentucky,	1
and	1
of	1
Kentucky	1
to	1
Lake	1
Champlain.	1
Nay,	1
the	1
debts	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
French	1
and	1
Dutch	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
in	1
militiamen	1
instead	1
of	1
louis	1
d'ors	1
and	1
ducats.	1
At	1
one	1
moment	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
large	1
army	1
to	1
lay	1
prostrate	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
at	1
another	1
moment	1
the	1
militia	1
of	1
Virginia	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
dragged	1
from	1
their	1
homes	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
hundred	1
miles,	1
to	1
tame	1
the	1
republican	1
contumacy	1
of	1
Massachusetts;	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
Massachusetts	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
transported	1
an	1
equal	1
distance	1
to	1
subdue	1
the	1
refractory	1
haughtiness	1
of	1
the	1
aristocratic	1
Virginians.	1
Do	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
rave	1
at	1
this	1
rate	1
imagine	1
that	1
their	1
art	1
or	1
their	1
eloquence	1
can	1
impose	1
any	1
conceits	1
or	1
absurdities	1
upon	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
for	1
infallible	1
truths?	1
If	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
an	1
army	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
as	1
the	1
engine	1
of	1
despotism,	1
what	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
militia?	1
If	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
army,	1
whither	1
would	1
the	1
militia,	1
irritated	1
by	1
being	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
undertake	1
a	1
distant	1
and	1
hopeless	1
expedition,	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
riveting	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
slavery	1
upon	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
countrymen,	1
direct	1
their	1
course,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
tyrants,	1
who	1
had	1
meditated	1
so	1
foolish	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
so	1
wicked	1
a	1
project,	1
to	1
crush	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
imagined	1
intrenchments	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
just	1
vengeance	1
of	1
an	1
abused	1
and	1
incensed	1
people?	1
Is	1
this	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
usurpers	1
stride	1
to	1
dominion	1
over	1
a	1
numerous	1
and	1
enlightened	1
nation?	1
Do	1
they	1
begin	1
by	1
exciting	1
the	1
detestation	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
instruments	1
of	1
their	1
intended	1
usurpations?	1
Do	1
they	1
usually	1
commence	1
their	1
career	1
by	1
wanton	1
and	1
disgustful	1
acts	1
of	1
power,	1
calculated	1
to	1
answer	1
no	1
end,	1
but	1
to	1
draw	1
upon	1
themselves	1
universal	1
hatred	1
and	1
execration?	1
Are	1
suppositions	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
the	1
sober	1
admonitions	1
of	1
discerning	1
patriots	1
to	1
a	1
discerning	1
people?	1
Or	1
are	1
they	1
the	1
inflammatory	1
ravings	1
of	1
incendiaries	1
or	1
distempered	1
enthusiasts?	1
If	1
we	1
were	1
even	1
to	1
suppose	1
the	1
national	1
rulers	1
actuated	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
ungovernable	1
ambition,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
employ	1
such	1
preposterous	1
means	1
to	1
accomplish	1
their	1
designs.	1
In	1
times	1
of	1
insurrection,	1
or	1
invasion,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
natural	1
and	1
proper	1
that	1
the	1
militia	1
of	1
a	1
neighboring	1
State	1
should	1
be	1
marched	1
into	1
another,	1
to	1
resist	1
a	1
common	1
enemy,	1
or	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
republic	1
against	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
faction	1
or	1
sedition.	1
This	1
was	1
frequently	1
the	1
case,	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
object,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
war;	1
and	1
this	1
mutual	1
succor	1
is,	1
indeed,	1
a	1
principal	1
end	1
of	1
our	1
political	1
association.	1
If	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
affording	1
it	1
be	1
placed	1
under	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
danger	1
of	1
a	1
supine	1
and	1
listless	1
inattention	1
to	1
the	1
dangers	1
of	1
a	1
neighbor,	1
till	1
its	1
near	1
approach	1
had	1
superadded	1
the	1
incitements	1
of	1
selfpreservation	1
to	1
the	1
too	1
feeble	1
impulses	1
of	1
duty	1
and	1
sympathy.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
IT	1
HAS	1
been	1
already	1
observed	1
that	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
ought	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
providing	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
forces;	1
in	1
which	1
proposition	1
was	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
included	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
raising	1
troops,	1
of	1
building	1
and	1
equipping	1
fleets,	1
and	1
all	1
other	1
expenses	1
in	1
any	1
wise	1
connected	1
with	1
military	1
arrangements	1
and	1
operations.	1
But	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
objects	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
revenue,	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
empowered	1
to	1
extend.	1
It	1
must	1
embrace	1
a	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
civil	1
list;	1
for	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
debts	1
contracted,	1
or	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
contracted;	1
and,	1
in	1
general,	1
for	1
all	1
those	1
matters	1
which	1
will	1
call	1
for	1
disbursements	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
treasury.	1
The	1
conclusion	1
is,	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
interwoven,	1
in	1
the	1
frame	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
a	1
general	1
power	1
of	1
taxation,	1
in	1
one	1
shape	1
or	1
another.	1
Money	1
is,	1
with	1
propriety,	1
considered	1
as	1
the	1
vital	1
principle	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
politic;	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
sustains	1
its	1
life	1
and	1
motion,	1
and	1
enables	1
it	1
to	1
perform	1
its	1
most	1
essential	1
functions.	1
A	1
complete	1
power,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
procure	1
a	1
regular	1
and	1
adequate	1
supply	1
of	1
it,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
will	1
permit,	1
may	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
an	1
indispensable	1
ingredient	1
in	1
every	1
constitution.	1
From	1
a	1
deficiency	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
one	1
of	1
two	1
evils	1
must	1
ensue;	1
either	1
the	1
people	1
must	1
be	1
subjected	1
to	1
continual	1
plunder,	1
as	1
a	1
substitute	1
for	1
a	1
more	1
eligible	1
mode	1
of	1
supplying	1
the	1
public	1
wants,	1
or	1
the	1
government	1
must	1
sink	1
into	1
a	1
fatal	1
atrophy,	1
and,	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
course	1
of	1
time,	1
perish.	1
In	1
the	1
Ottoman	1
or	1
Turkish	1
empire,	1
the	1
sovereign,	1
though	1
in	1
other	1
respects	1
absolute	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
lives	1
and	1
fortunes	1
of	1
his	1
subjects,	1
has	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
impose	1
a	1
new	1
tax.	1
The	1
consequence	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
permits	1
the	1
bashaws	1
or	1
governors	1
of	1
provinces	1
to	1
pillage	1
the	1
people	1
without	1
mercy;	1
and,	1
in	1
turn,	1
squeezes	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
sums	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
stands	1
in	1
need,	1
to	1
satisfy	1
his	1
own	1
exigencies	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
state.	1
In	1
America,	1
from	1
a	1
like	1
cause,	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
has	1
gradually	1
dwindled	1
into	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
decay,	1
approaching	1
nearly	1
to	1
annihilation.	1
Who	1
can	1
doubt,	1
that	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
both	1
countries	1
would	1
be	1
promoted	1
by	1
competent	1
authorities	1
in	1
the	1
proper	1
hands,	1
to	1
provide	1
the	1
revenues	1
which	1
the	1
necessities	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
might	1
require?	1
The	1
present	1
Confederation,	1
feeble	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
intended	1
to	1
repose	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
an	1
unlimited	1
power	1
of	1
providing	1
for	1
the	1
pecuniary	1
wants	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
But	1
proceeding	1
upon	1
an	1
erroneous	1
principle,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
entirely	1
to	1
have	1
frustrated	1
the	1
intention.	1
Congress,	1
by	1
the	1
articles	1
which	1
compose	1
that	1
compact	1
(as	1
has	1
already	1
been	1
stated),	1
are	1
authorized	1
to	1
ascertain	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
any	1
sums	1
of	1
money	1
necessary,	1
in	1
their	1
judgment,	1
to	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States;	1
and	1
their	1
requisitions,	1
if	1
conformable	1
to	1
the	1
rule	1
of	1
apportionment,	1
are	1
in	1
every	1
constitutional	1
sense	1
obligatory	1
upon	1
the	1
States.	1
These	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
question	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
the	1
demand;	1
no	1
discretion	1
beyond	1
that	1
of	1
devising	1
the	1
ways	1
and	1
means	1
of	1
furnishing	1
the	1
sums	1
demanded.	1
But	1
though	1
this	1
be	1
strictly	1
and	1
truly	1
the	1
case;	1
though	1
the	1
assumption	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
right	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
infringement	1
of	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Union;	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
seldom	1
or	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
avowedly	1
claimed,	1
yet	1
in	1
practice	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
constantly	1
exercised,	1
and	1
would	1
continue	1
to	1
be	1
so,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
revenues	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy	1
should	1
remain	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
intermediate	1
agency	1
of	1
its	1
members.	1
What	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
this	1
system	1
have	1
been,	1
is	1
within	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
the	1
least	1
conversant	1
in	1
our	1
public	1
affairs,	1
and	1
has	1
been	1
amply	1
unfolded	1
in	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
these	1
inquiries.	1
It	1
is	1
this	1
which	1
has	1
chiefly	1
contributed	1
to	1
reduce	1
us	1
to	1
a	1
situation,	1
which	1
affords	1
ample	1
cause	1
both	1
of	1
mortification	1
to	1
ourselves,	1
and	1
of	1
triumph	1
to	1
our	1
enemies.	1
What	1
remedy	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
for	1
this	1
situation,	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
the	1
system	1
which	1
has	1
produced	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
the	1
fallacious	1
and	1
delusive	1
system	1
of	1
quotas	1
and	1
requisitions?	1
What	1
substitute	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
imagined	1
for	1
this	1
ignis	1
fatuus	1
in	1
finance,	1
but	1
that	1
of	1
permitting	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
to	1
raise	1
its	1
own	1
revenues	1
by	1
the	1
ordinary	1
methods	1
of	1
taxation	1
authorized	1
in	1
every	1
well-ordered	1
constitution	1
of	1
civil	1
government?	1
Ingenious	1
men	1
may	1
declaim	1
with	1
plausibility	1
on	1
any	1
subject;	1
but	1
no	1
human	1
ingenuity	1
can	1
point	1
out	1
any	1
other	1
expedient	1
to	1
rescue	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
inconveniences	1
and	1
embarrassments	1
naturally	1
resulting	1
from	1
defective	1
supplies	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
treasury.	1
The	1
more	1
intelligent	1
adversaries	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution	1
admit	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
this	1
reasoning;	1
but	1
they	1
qualify	1
their	1
admission	1
by	1
a	1
distinction	1
between	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
INTERNAL	1
and	1
EXTERNAL	1
taxation.	1
The	1
former	1
they	1
would	1
reserve	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
governments;	1
the	1
latter,	1
which	1
they	1
explain	1
into	1
commercial	1
imposts,	1
or	1
rather	1
duties	1
on	1
imported	1
articles,	1
they	1
declare	1
themselves	1
willing	1
to	1
concede	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
head.	1
This	1
distinction,	1
however,	1
would	1
violate	1
the	1
maxim	1
of	1
good	1
sense	1
and	1
sound	1
policy,	1
which	1
dictates	1
that	1
every	1
POWER	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
its	1
OBJECT;	1
and	1
would	1
still	1
leave	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
tutelage	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
every	1
idea	1
of	1
vigor	1
or	1
efficiency.	1
Who	1
can	1
pretend	1
that	1
commercial	1
imposts	1
are,	1
or	1
would	1
be,	1
alone	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
and	1
future	1
exigencies	1
of	1
the	1
Union?	1
Taking	1
into	1
the	1
account	1
the	1
existing	1
debt,	1
foreign	1
and	1
domestic,	1
upon	1
any	1
plan	1
of	1
extinguishment	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
moderately	1
impressed	1
with	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
public	1
justice	1
and	1
public	1
credit	1
could	1
approve,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
establishments	1
which	1
all	1
parties	1
will	1
acknowledge	1
to	1
be	1
necessary,	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
reasonably	1
flatter	1
ourselves,	1
that	1
this	1
resource	1
alone,	1
upon	1
the	1
most	1
improved	1
scale,	1
would	1
even	1
suffice	1
for	1
its	1
present	1
necessities.	1
Its	1
future	1
necessities	1
admit	1
not	1
of	1
calculation	1
or	1
limitation;	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
principle,	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
adverted	1
to,	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
provision	1
for	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
arise	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
equally	1
unconfined.	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
position	1
warranted	1
by	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
mankind,	1
that,	1
IN	1
THE	1
USUAL	1
PROGRESS	1
OF	1
THINGS,	1
THE	1
NECESSITIES	1
OF	1
A	1
NATION,	1
IN	1
EVERY	1
STAGE	1
OF	1
ITS	1
EXISTENCE,	1
WILL	1
BE	1
FOUND	1
AT	1
LEAST	1
EQUAL	1
TO	1
ITS	1
RESOURCES.	1
To	1
say	1
that	1
deficiencies	1
may	1
be	1
provided	1
for	1
by	1
requisitions	1
upon	1
the	1
States,	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
this	1
system	1
cannot	1
be	1
depended	1
upon,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
to	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
for	1
every	1
thing	1
beyond	1
a	1
certain	1
limit.	1
Those	1
who	1
have	1
carefully	1
attended	1
to	1
its	1
vices	1
and	1
deformities	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
exhibited	1
by	1
experience	1
or	1
delineated	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
papers,	1
must	1
feel	1
invincible	1
repugnancy	1
to	1
trusting	1
the	1
national	1
interests	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
to	1
its	1
operation.	1
Its	1
inevitable	1
tendency,	1
whenever	1
it	1
is	1
brought	1
into	1
activity,	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
enfeeble	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
sow	1
the	1
seeds	1
of	1
discord	1
and	1
contention	1
between	1
the	1
federal	1
head	1
and	1
its	1
members,	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
members	1
themselves.	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
expected	1
that	1
the	1
deficiencies	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
supplied	1
in	1
this	1
mode	1
than	1
the	1
total	1
wants	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
have	1
heretofore	1
been	1
supplied	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
mode?	1
It	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
recollected	1
that	1
if	1
less	1
will	1
be	1
required	1
from	1
the	1
States,	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
proportionably	1
less	1
means	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
demand.	1
If	1
the	1
opinions	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
contend	1
for	1
the	1
distinction	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
mentioned	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
received	1
as	1
evidence	1
of	1
truth,	1
one	1
would	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
conclude	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
known	1
point	1
in	1
the	1
economy	1
of	1
national	1
affairs	1
at	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
safe	1
to	1
stop	1
and	1
to	1
say:	1
Thus	1
far	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
public	1
happiness	1
will	1
be	1
promoted	1
by	1
supplying	1
the	1
wants	1
of	1
government,	1
and	1
all	1
beyond	1
this	1
is	1
unworthy	1
of	1
our	1
care	1
or	1
anxiety.	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
a	1
government	1
half	1
supplied	1
and	1
always	1
necessitous,	1
can	1
fulfill	1
the	1
purposes	1
of	1
its	1
institution,	1
can	1
provide	1
for	1
the	1
security,	1
advance	1
the	1
prosperity,	1
or	1
support	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
the	1
commonwealth?	1
How	1
can	1
it	1
ever	1
possess	1
either	1
energy	1
or	1
stability,	1
dignity	1
or	1
credit,	1
confidence	1
at	1
home	1
or	1
respectability	1
abroad?	1
How	1
can	1
its	1
administration	1
be	1
any	1
thing	1
else	1
than	1
a	1
succession	1
of	1
expedients	1
temporizing,	1
impotent,	1
disgraceful?	1
How	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
frequent	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
its	1
engagements	1
to	1
immediate	1
necessity?	1
How	1
can	1
it	1
undertake	1
or	1
execute	1
any	1
liberal	1
or	1
enlarged	1
plans	1
of	1
public	1
good?	1
Let	1
us	1
attend	1
to	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
this	1
situation	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
war	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
engaged.	1
We	1
will	1
presume,	1
for	1
argument's	1
sake,	1
that	1
the	1
revenue	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
impost	1
duties	1
answers	1
the	1
purposes	1
of	1
a	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
debt	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
peace	1
establishment	1
for	1
the	1
Union.	1
Thus	1
circumstanced,	1
a	1
war	1
breaks	1
out.	1
What	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
probable	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
emergency?	1
Taught	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
proper	1
dependence	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
requisitions,	1
unable	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
authority	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
of	1
fresh	1
resources,	1
and	1
urged	1
by	1
considerations	1
of	1
national	1
danger,	1
would	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
driven	1
to	1
the	1
expedient	1
of	1
diverting	1
the	1
funds	1
already	1
appropriated	1
from	1
their	1
proper	1
objects	1
to	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
State?	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
a	1
step	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
could	1
be	1
avoided;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
taken,	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
prove	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
public	1
credit	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
becoming	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
safety.	1
To	1
imagine	1
that	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
crisis	1
credit	1
might	1
be	1
dispensed	1
with,	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
extreme	1
of	1
infatuation.	1
In	1
the	1
modern	1
system	1
of	1
war,	1
nations	1
the	1
most	1
wealthy	1
are	1
obliged	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
large	1
loans.	1
A	1
country	1
so	1
little	1
opulent	1
as	1
ours	1
must	1
feel	1
this	1
necessity	1
in	1
a	1
much	1
stronger	1
degree.	1
But	1
who	1
would	1
lend	1
to	1
a	1
government	1
that	1
prefaced	1
its	1
overtures	1
for	1
borrowing	1
by	1
an	1
act	1
which	1
demonstrated	1
that	1
no	1
reliance	1
could	1
be	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
steadiness	1
of	1
its	1
measures	1
for	1
paying?	1
The	1
loans	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
procure	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
limited	1
in	1
their	1
extent	1
as	1
burdensome	1
in	1
their	1
conditions.	1
They	1
would	1
be	1
made	1
upon	1
the	1
same	1
principles	1
that	1
usurers	1
commonly	1
lend	1
to	1
bankrupt	1
and	1
fraudulent	1
debtors,	1
with	1
a	1
sparing	1
hand	1
and	1
at	1
enormous	1
premiums.	1
It	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
imagined	1
that,	1
from	1
the	1
scantiness	1
of	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
diverting	1
the	1
established	1
funds	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
supposed	1
would	1
exist,	1
though	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
should	1
possess	1
an	1
unrestrained	1
power	1
of	1
taxation.	1
But	1
two	1
considerations	1
will	1
serve	1
to	1
quiet	1
all	1
apprehension	1
on	1
this	1
head:	1
one	1
is,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
sure	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
community,	1
in	1
their	1
full	1
extent,	1
will	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
activity	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
Union;	1
the	1
other	1
is,	1
that	1
whatever	1
deficiences	1
there	1
may	1
be,	1
can	1
without	1
difficulty	1
be	1
supplied	1
by	1
loans.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
creating	1
new	1
funds	1
upon	1
new	1
objects	1
of	1
taxation,	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
authority,	1
would	1
enable	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
to	1
borrow	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
its	1
necessities	1
might	1
require.	1
Foreigners,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
America,	1
could	1
then	1
reasonably	1
repose	1
confidence	1
in	1
its	1
engagements;	1
but	1
to	1
depend	1
upon	1
a	1
government	1
that	1
must	1
itself	1
depend	1
upon	1
thirteen	1
other	1
governments	1
for	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
fulfilling	1
its	1
contracts,	1
when	1
once	1
its	1
situation	1
is	1
clearly	1
understood,	1
would	1
require	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
credulity	1
not	1
often	1
to	1
be	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
the	1
pecuniary	1
transactions	1
of	1
mankind,	1
and	1
little	1
reconcilable	1
with	1
the	1
usual	1
sharp-sightedness	1
of	1
avarice.	1
Reflections	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
may	1
have	1
trifling	1
weight	1
with	1
men	1
who	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
realized	1
in	1
America	1
the	1
halcyon	1
scenes	1
of	1
the	1
poetic	1
or	1
fabulous	1
age;	1
but	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
believe	1
we	1
are	1
likely	1
to	1
experience	1
a	1
common	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
vicissitudes	1
and	1
calamities	1
which	1
have	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
other	1
nations,	1
they	1
must	1
appear	1
entitled	1
to	1
serious	1
attention.	1
Such	1
men	1
must	1
behold	1
the	1
actual	1
situation	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
with	1
painful	1
solicitude,	1
and	1
deprecate	1
the	1
evils	1
which	1
ambition	1
or	1
revenge	1
might,	1
with	1
too	1
much	1
facility,	1
inflict	1
upon	1
it.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
IN	1
DISQUISITIONS	1
of	1
every	1
kind,	1
there	1
are	1
certain	1
primary	1
truths,	1
or	1
first	1
principles,	1
upon	1
which	1
all	1
subsequent	1
reasonings	1
must	1
depend.	1
These	1
contain	1
an	1
internal	1
evidence	1
which,	1
antecedent	1
to	1
all	1
reflection	1
or	1
combination,	1
commands	1
the	1
assent	1
of	1
the	1
mind.	1
Where	1
it	1
produces	1
not	1
this	1
effect,	1
it	1
must	1
proceed	1
either	1
from	1
some	1
defect	1
or	1
disorder	1
in	1
the	1
organs	1
of	1
perception,	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
some	1
strong	1
interest,	1
or	1
passion,	1
or	1
prejudice.	1
Of	1
this	1
nature	1
are	1
the	1
maxims	1
in	1
geometry,	1
that	1
"the	1
whole	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
its	1
part;	1
things	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
are	1
equal	1
to	1
one	1
another;	1
two	1
straight	1
lines	1
cannot	1
enclose	1
a	1
space;	1
and	1
all	1
right	1
angles	1
are	1
equal	1
to	1
each	1
other."	1
Of	1
the	1
same	1
nature	1
are	1
these	1
other	1
maxims	1
in	1
ethics	1
and	1
politics,	1
that	1
there	1
cannot	1
be	1
an	1
effect	1
without	1
a	1
cause;	1
that	1
the	1
means	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
proportioned	1
to	1
the	1
end;	1
that	1
every	1
power	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
commensurate	1
with	1
its	1
object;	1
that	1
there	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
limitation	1
of	1
a	1
power	1
destined	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
purpose	1
which	1
is	1
itself	1
incapable	1
of	1
limitation.	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
truths	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
latter	1
sciences	1
which,	1
if	1
they	1
cannot	1
pretend	1
to	1
rank	1
in	1
the	1
class	1
of	1
axioms,	1
are	1
yet	1
such	1
direct	1
inferences	1
from	1
them,	1
and	1
so	1
obvious	1
in	1
themselves,	1
and	1
so	1
agreeable	1
to	1
the	1
natural	1
and	1
unsophisticated	1
dictates	1
of	1
common-sense,	1
that	1
they	1
challenge	1
the	1
assent	1
of	1
a	1
sound	1
and	1
unbiased	1
mind,	1
with	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
force	1
and	1
conviction	1
almost	1
equally	1
irresistible.	1
The	1
objects	1
of	1
geometrical	1
inquiry	1
are	1
so	1
entirely	1
abstracted	1
from	1
those	1
pursuits	1
which	1
stir	1
up	1
and	1
put	1
in	1
motion	1
the	1
unruly	1
passions	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
heart,	1
that	1
mankind,	1
without	1
difficulty,	1
adopt	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
more	1
simple	1
theorems	1
of	1
the	1
science,	1
but	1
even	1
those	1
abstruse	1
paradoxes	1
which,	1
however	1
they	1
may	1
appear	1
susceptible	1
of	1
demonstration,	1
are	1
at	1
variance	1
with	1
the	1
natural	1
conceptions	1
which	1
the	1
mind,	1
without	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
philosophy,	1
would	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
entertain	1
upon	1
the	1
subject.	1
The	1
INFINITE	1
DIVISIBILITY	1
of	1
matter,	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
the	1
INFINITE	1
divisibility	1
of	1
a	1
FINITE	1
thing,	1
extending	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
minutest	1
atom,	1
is	1
a	1
point	1
agreed	1
among	1
geometricians,	1
though	1
not	1
less	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
common-sense	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
mysteries	1
in	1
religion,	1
against	1
which	1
the	1
batteries	1
of	1
infidelity	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
industriously	1
leveled.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
sciences	1
of	1
morals	1
and	1
politics,	1
men	1
are	1
found	1
far	1
less	1
tractable.	1
To	1
a	1
certain	1
degree,	1
it	1
is	1
right	1
and	1
useful	1
that	1
this	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
case.	1
Caution	1
and	1
investigation	1
are	1
a	1
necessary	1
armor	1
against	1
error	1
and	1
imposition.	1
But	1
this	1
untractableness	1
may	1
be	1
carried	1
too	1
far,	1
and	1
may	1
degenerate	1
into	1
obstinacy,	1
perverseness,	1
or	1
disingenuity.	1
Though	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
pretended	1
that	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
moral	1
and	1
political	1
knowledge	1
have,	1
in	1
general,	1
the	1
same	1
degree	1
of	1
certainty	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
mathematics,	1
yet	1
they	1
have	1
much	1
better	1
claims	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
than,	1
to	1
judge	1
from	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
particular	1
situations,	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
allow	1
them.	1
The	1
obscurity	1
is	1
much	1
oftener	1
in	1
the	1
passions	1
and	1
prejudices	1
of	1
the	1
reasoner	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
subject.	1
Men,	1
upon	1
too	1
many	1
occasions,	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
their	1
own	1
understandings	1
fair	1
play;	1
but,	1
yielding	1
to	1
some	1
untoward	1
bias,	1
they	1
entangle	1
themselves	1
in	1
words	1
and	1
confound	1
themselves	1
in	1
subtleties.	1
How	1
else	1
could	1
it	1
happen	1
(if	1
we	1
admit	1
the	1
objectors	1
to	1
be	1
sincere	1
in	1
their	1
opposition),	1
that	1
positions	1
so	1
clear	1
as	1
those	1
which	1
manifest	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
power	1
of	1
taxation	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
encounter	1
any	1
adversaries	1
among	1
men	1
of	1
discernment?	1
Though	1
these	1
positions	1
have	1
been	1
elsewhere	1
fully	1
stated,	1
they	1
will	1
perhaps	1
not	1
be	1
improperly	1
recapitulated	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
as	1
introductory	1
to	1
an	1
examination	1
of	1
what	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
offered	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
objection	1
to	1
them.	1
They	1
are	1
in	1
substance	1
as	1
follows:	1
A	1
government	1
ought	1
to	1
contain	1
in	1
itself	1
every	1
power	1
requisite	1
to	1
the	1
full	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
the	1
objects	1
committed	1
to	1
its	1
care,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
complete	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
trusts	1
for	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
responsible,	1
free	1
from	1
every	1
other	1
control	1
but	1
a	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
As	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
superintending	1
the	1
national	1
defense	1
and	1
of	1
securing	1
the	1
public	1
peace	1
against	1
foreign	1
or	1
domestic	1
violence	1
involve	1
a	1
provision	1
for	1
casualties	1
and	1
dangers	1
to	1
which	1
no	1
possible	1
limits	1
can	1
be	1
assigned,	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
that	1
provision	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
no	1
other	1
bounds	1
than	1
the	1
exigencies	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
and	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
As	1
revenue	1
is	1
the	1
essential	1
engine	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
answering	1
the	1
national	1
exigencies	1
must	1
be	1
procured,	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
procuring	1
that	1
article	1
in	1
its	1
full	1
extent	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
comprehended	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
providing	1
for	1
those	1
exigencies.	1
As	1
theory	1
and	1
practice	1
conspire	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
procuring	1
revenue	1
is	1
unavailing	1
when	1
exercised	1
over	1
the	1
States	1
in	1
their	1
collective	1
capacities,	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
must	1
of	1
necessity	1
be	1
invested	1
with	1
an	1
unqualified	1
power	1
of	1
taxation	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
modes.	1
Did	1
not	1
experience	1
evince	1
the	1
contrary,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
natural	1
to	1
conclude	1
that	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
power	1
of	1
taxation	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
might	1
safely	1
be	1
permitted	1
to	1
rest	1
on	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
these	1
propositions,	1
unassisted	1
by	1
any	1
additional	1
arguments	1
or	1
illustrations.	1
But	1
we	1
find,	1
in	1
fact,	1
that	1
the	1
antagonists	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
acquiescing	1
in	1
their	1
justness	1
or	1
truth,	1
seem	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
principal	1
and	1
most	1
zealous	1
effort	1
against	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
plan.	1
It	1
may	1
therefore	1
be	1
satisfactory	1
to	1
analyze	1
the	1
arguments	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
combat	1
it.	1
Those	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
labored	1
with	1
that	1
view,	1
seem	1
in	1
substance	1
to	1
amount	1
to	1
this:	1
"It	1
is	1
not	1
true,	1
because	1
the	1
exigencies	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
susceptible	1
of	1
limitation,	1
that	1
its	1
power	1
of	1
laying	1
taxes	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
unconfined.	1
Revenue	1
is	1
as	1
requisite	1
to	1
the	1
purposes	1
of	1
the	1
local	1
administrations	1
as	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Union;	1
and	1
the	1
former	1
are	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
equal	1
importance	1
with	1
the	1
latter	1
to	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
It	1
is,	1
therefore,	1
as	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
command	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
supplying	1
their	1
wants,	1
as	1
that	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
should	1
possess	1
the	1
like	1
faculty	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
wants	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
But	1
an	1
indefinite	1
power	1
of	1
taxation	1
in	1
the	1
LATTER	1
might,	1
and	1
probably	1
would	1
in	1
time,	1
deprive	1
the	1
FORMER	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
providing	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
necessities;	1
and	1
would	1
subject	1
them	1
entirely	1
to	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
legislature.	1
As	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
are	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
supreme	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
pass	1
all	1
laws	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
NECESSARY	1
for	1
carrying	1
into	1
execution	1
the	1
authorities	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
proposed	1
to	1
vest	1
it,	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
might	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
abolish	1
the	1
taxes	1
imposed	1
for	1
State	1
objects	1
upon	1
the	1
pretense	1
of	1
an	1
interference	1
with	1
its	1
own.	1
It	1
might	1
allege	1
a	1
necessity	1
of	1
doing	1
this	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
give	1
efficacy	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
revenues.	1
And	1
thus	1
all	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
taxation	1
might	1
by	1
degrees	1
become	1
the	1
subjects	1
of	1
federal	1
monopoly,	1
to	1
the	1
entire	1
exclusion	1
and	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments."	1
This	1
mode	1
of	1
reasoning	1
appears	1
sometimes	1
to	1
turn	1
upon	1
the	1
supposition	1
of	1
usurpation	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
government;	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
designed	1
only	1
as	1
a	1
deduction	1
from	1
the	1
constitutional	1
operation	1
of	1
its	1
intended	1
powers.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
light	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
admitted	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
pretensions	1
to	1
fairness.	1
The	1
moment	1
we	1
launch	1
into	1
conjectures	1
about	1
the	1
usurpations	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
we	1
get	1
into	1
an	1
unfathomable	1
abyss,	1
and	1
fairly	1
put	1
ourselves	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
all	1
reasoning.	1
Imagination	1
may	1
range	1
at	1
pleasure	1
till	1
it	1
gets	1
bewildered	1
amidst	1
the	1
labyrinths	1
of	1
an	1
enchanted	1
castle,	1
and	1
knows	1
not	1
on	1
which	1
side	1
to	1
turn	1
to	1
extricate	1
itself	1
from	1
the	1
perplexities	1
into	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
so	1
rashly	1
adventured.	1
Whatever	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
limits	1
or	1
modifications	1
of	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
imagine	1
an	1
endless	1
train	1
of	1
possible	1
dangers;	1
and	1
by	1
indulging	1
an	1
excess	1
of	1
jealousy	1
and	1
timidity,	1
we	1
may	1
bring	1
ourselves	1
to	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
absolute	1
scepticism	1
and	1
irresolution.	1
I	1
repeat	1
here	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
observed	1
in	1
substance	1
in	1
another	1
place,	1
that	1
all	1
observations	1
founded	1
upon	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
usurpation	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
composition	1
and	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
or	1
extent	1
of	1
its	1
powers.	1
The	1
State	1
governments,	1
by	1
their	1
original	1
constitutions,	1
are	1
invested	1
with	1
complete	1
sovereignty.	1
In	1
what	1
does	1
our	1
security	1
consist	1
against	1
usurpation	1
from	1
that	1
quarter?	1
Doubtless	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
their	1
formation,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
due	1
dependence	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
administer	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
people.	1
If	1
the	1
proposed	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
be	1
found,	1
upon	1
an	1
impartial	1
examination	1
of	1
it,	1
to	1
be	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
afford,	1
to	1
a	1
proper	1
extent,	1
the	1
same	1
species	1
of	1
security,	1
all	1
apprehensions	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
usurpation	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
discarded.	1
It	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
forgotten	1
that	1
a	1
disposition	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
to	1
encroach	1
upon	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
is	1
quite	1
as	1
probable	1
as	1
a	1
disposition	1
in	1
the	1
Union	1
to	1
encroach	1
upon	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments.	1
What	1
side	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
prevail	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
conflict,	1
must	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
means	1
which	1
the	1
contending	1
parties	1
could	1
employ	1
toward	1
insuring	1
success.	1
As	1
in	1
republics	1
strength	1
is	1
always	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
weighty	1
reasons	1
to	1
induce	1
a	1
belief	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
will	1
commonly	1
possess	1
most	1
influence	1
over	1
them,	1
the	1
natural	1
conclusion	1
is	1
that	1
such	1
contests	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
apt	1
to	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
disadvantage	1
of	1
the	1
Union;	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
greater	1
probability	1
of	1
encroachments	1
by	1
the	1
members	1
upon	1
the	1
federal	1
head,	1
than	1
by	1
the	1
federal	1
head	1
upon	1
the	1
members.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
all	1
conjectures	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
must	1
be	1
extremely	1
vague	1
and	1
fallible:	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
safest	1
course	1
to	1
lay	1
them	1
altogether	1
aside,	1
and	1
to	1
confine	1
our	1
attention	1
wholly	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
and	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
powers	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
delineated	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
Every	1
thing	1
beyond	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
prudence	1
and	1
firmness	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
who,	1
as	1
they	1
will	1
hold	1
the	1
scales	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
hands,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
hoped,	1
will	1
always	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
constitutional	1
equilibrium	1
between	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
the	1
State	1
governments.	1
Upon	1
this	1
ground,	1
which	1
is	1
evidently	1
the	1
true	1
one,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
obviate	1
the	1
objections	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
an	1
indefinite	1
power	1
of	1
taxation	1
in	1
the	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
ALTHOUGH	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
opinion	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
real	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
consequences	1
which	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
apprehended	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
from	1
a	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
Union	1
to	1
control	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
levies	1
of	1
money,	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
extreme	1
hazard	1
of	1
provoking	1
the	1
resentments	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
and	1
a	1
conviction	1
of	1
the	1
utility	1
and	1
necessity	1
of	1
local	1
administrations	1
for	1
local	1
purposes,	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
complete	1
barrier	1
against	1
the	1
oppressive	1
use	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
power;	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
willing	1
here	1
to	1
allow,	1
in	1
its	1
full	1
extent,	1
the	1
justness	1
of	1
the	1
reasoning	1
which	1
requires	1
that	1
the	1
individual	1
States	1
should	1
possess	1
an	1
independent	1
and	1
uncontrollable	1
authority	1
to	1
raise	1
their	1
own	1
revenues	1
for	1
the	1
supply	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
wants.	1
And	1
making	1
this	1
concession,	1
I	1
affirm	1
that	1
(with	1
the	1
sole	1
exception	1
of	1
duties	1
on	1
imports	1
and	1
exports)	1
they	1
would,	1
under	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
retain	1
that	1
authority	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
absolute	1
and	1
unqualified	1
sense;	1
and	1
that	1
an	1
attempt	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
to	1
abridge	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
it,	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
violent	1
assumption	1
of	1
power,	1
unwarranted	1
by	1
any	1
article	1
or	1
clause	1
of	1
its	1
Constitution.	1
An	1
entire	1
consolidation	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
into	1
one	1
complete	1
national	1
sovereignty	1
would	1
imply	1
an	1
entire	1
subordination	1
of	1
the	1
parts;	1
and	1
whatever	1
powers	1
might	1
remain	1
in	1
them,	1
would	1
be	1
altogether	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
general	1
will.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
aims	1
only	1
at	1
a	1
partial	1
union	1
or	1
consolidation,	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
would	1
clearly	1
retain	1
all	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
sovereignty	1
which	1
they	1
before	1
had,	1
and	1
which	1
were	1
not,	1
by	1
that	1
act,	1
EXCLUSIVELY	1
delegated	1
to	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
This	1
exclusive	1
delegation,	1
or	1
rather	1
this	1
alienation,	1
of	1
State	1
sovereignty,	1
would	1
only	1
exist	1
in	1
three	1
cases:	1
where	1
the	1
Constitution	1
in	1
express	1
terms	1
granted	1
an	1
exclusive	1
authority	1
to	1
the	1
Union;	1
where	1
it	1
granted	1
in	1
one	1
instance	1
an	1
authority	1
to	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
in	1
another	1
prohibited	1
the	1
States	1
from	1
exercising	1
the	1
like	1
authority;	1
and	1
where	1
it	1
granted	1
an	1
authority	1
to	1
the	1
Union,	1
to	1
which	1
a	1
similar	1
authority	1
in	1
the	1
States	1
would	1
be	1
absolutely	1
and	1
totally	1
CONTRADICTORY	1
and	1
REPUGNANT.	1
I	1
use	1
these	1
terms	1
to	1
distinguish	1
this	1
last	1
case	1
from	1
another	1
which	1
might	1
appear	1
to	1
resemble	1
it,	1
but	1
which	1
would,	1
in	1
fact,	1
be	1
essentially	1
different;	1
I	1
mean	1
where	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
a	1
concurrent	1
jurisdiction	1
might	1
be	1
productive	1
of	1
occasional	1
interferences	1
in	1
the	1
POLICY	1
of	1
any	1
branch	1
of	1
administration,	1
but	1
would	1
not	1
imply	1
any	1
direct	1
contradiction	1
or	1
repugnancy	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
constitutional	1
authority.	1
These	1
three	1
cases	1
of	1
exclusive	1
jurisdiction	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
may	1
be	1
exemplified	1
by	1
the	1
following	1
instances:	1
The	1
last	1
clause	1
but	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
eighth	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
article	1
provides	1
expressly	1
that	1
Congress	1
shall	1
exercise	1
"EXCLUSIVE	1
LEGISLATION"	1
over	1
the	1
district	1
to	1
be	1
appropriated	1
as	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
government.	1
This	1
answers	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
case.	1
The	1
first	1
clause	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
section	1
empowers	1
Congress	1
"TO	1
LAY	1
AND	1
COLLECT	1
TAXES,	1
DUTIES,	1
IMPOSTS	1
AND	1
EXCISES";	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
clause	1
of	1
the	1
tenth	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
article	1
declares	1
that,	1
"NO	1
STATE	1
SHALL,	1
without	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
Congress,	1
LAY	1
ANY	1
IMPOSTS	1
OR	1
DUTIES	1
ON	1
IMPORTS	1
OR	1
EXPORTS,	1
except	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
executing	1
its	1
inspection	1
laws."	1
Hence	1
would	1
result	1
an	1
exclusive	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
Union	1
to	1
lay	1
duties	1
on	1
imports	1
and	1
exports,	1
with	1
the	1
particular	1
exception	1
mentioned;	1
but	1
this	1
power	1
is	1
abridged	1
by	1
another	1
clause,	1
which	1
declares	1
that	1
no	1
tax	1
or	1
duty	1
shall	1
be	1
laid	1
on	1
articles	1
exported	1
from	1
any	1
State;	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
which	1
qualification,	1
it	1
now	1
only	1
extends	1
to	1
the	1
DUTIES	1
ON	1
IMPORTS.	1
This	1
answers	1
to	1
the	1
second	1
case.	1
The	1
third	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
that	1
clause	1
which	1
declares	1
that	1
Congress	1
shall	1
have	1
power	1
"to	1
establish	1
an	1
UNIFORM	1
RULE	1
of	1
naturalization	1
throughout	1
the	1
United	1
States."	1
This	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
exclusive;	1
because	1
if	1
each	1
State	1
had	1
power	1
to	1
prescribe	1
a	1
DISTINCT	1
RULE,	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
UNIFORM	1
RULE.	1
A	1
case	1
which	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
thought	1
to	1
resemble	1
the	1
latter,	1
but	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
fact	1
widely	1
different,	1
affects	1
the	1
question	1
immediately	1
under	1
consideration.	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
imposing	1
taxes	1
on	1
all	1
articles	1
other	1
than	1
exports	1
and	1
imports.	1
This,	1
I	1
contend,	1
is	1
manifestly	1
a	1
concurrent	1
and	1
coequal	1
authority	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
individual	1
States.	1
There	1
is	1
plainly	1
no	1
expression	1
in	1
the	1
granting	1
clause	1
which	1
makes	1
that	1
power	1
EXCLUSIVE	1
in	1
the	1
Union.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
independent	1
clause	1
or	1
sentence	1
which	1
prohibits	1
the	1
States	1
from	1
exercising	1
it.	1
So	1
far	1
is	1
this	1
from	1
being	1
the	1
case,	1
that	1
a	1
plain	1
and	1
conclusive	1
argument	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
deduced	1
from	1
the	1
restraint	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
States	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
duties	1
on	1
imports	1
and	1
exports.	1
This	1
restriction	1
implies	1
an	1
admission	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
inserted,	1
the	1
States	1
would	1
possess	1
the	1
power	1
it	1
excludes;	1
and	1
it	1
implies	1
a	1
further	1
admission,	1
that	1
as	1
to	1
all	1
other	1
taxes,	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
remains	1
undiminished.	1
In	1
any	1
other	1
view	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
both	1
unnecessary	1
and	1
dangerous;	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
unnecessary,	1
because	1
if	1
the	1
grant	1
to	1
the	1
Union	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
laying	1
such	1
duties	1
implied	1
the	1
exclusion	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
or	1
even	1
their	1
subordination	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
restriction;	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
dangerous,	1
because	1
the	1
introduction	1
of	1
it	1
leads	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
which,	1
if	1
the	1
reasoning	1
of	1
the	1
objectors	1
be	1
just,	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
intended;	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
the	1
States,	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
restriction	1
did	1
not	1
apply,	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
concurrent	1
power	1
of	1
taxation	1
with	1
the	1
Union.	1
The	1
restriction	1
in	1
question	1
amounts	1
to	1
what	1
lawyers	1
call	1
a	1
NEGATIVE	1
PREGNANT	1
that	1
is,	1
a	1
NEGATION	1
of	1
one	1
thing,	1
and	1
an	1
AFFIRMANCE	1
of	1
another;	1
a	1
negation	1
of	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
to	1
impose	1
taxes	1
on	1
imports	1
and	1
exports,	1
and	1
an	1
affirmance	1
of	1
their	1
authority	1
to	1
impose	1
them	1
on	1
all	1
other	1
articles.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
mere	1
sophistry	1
to	1
argue	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
meant	1
to	1
exclude	1
them	1
ABSOLUTELY	1
from	1
the	1
imposition	1
of	1
taxes	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
kind,	1
and	1
to	1
leave	1
them	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
lay	1
others	1
SUBJECT	1
TO	1
THE	1
CONTROL	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
legislature.	1
The	1
restraining	1
or	1
prohibitory	1
clause	1
only	1
says,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not,	1
WITHOUT	1
THE	1
CONSENT	1
OF	1
CONGRESS,	1
lay	1
such	1
duties;	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
understand	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
last	1
mentioned,	1
the	1
Constitution	1
would	1
then	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
introduce	1
a	1
formal	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
absurd	1
conclusion;	1
which	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
States,	1
WITH	1
THE	1
CONSENT	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
legislature,	1
might	1
tax	1
imports	1
and	1
exports;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
tax	1
every	1
other	1
article,	1
UNLESS	1
CONTROLLED	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
body.	1
If	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
intention,	1
why	1
not	1
leave	1
it,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance,	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
alleged	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
natural	1
operation	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
clause,	1
conferring	1
a	1
general	1
power	1
of	1
taxation	1
upon	1
the	1
Union?	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
this	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
intention,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
bear	1
a	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
As	1
to	1
a	1
supposition	1
of	1
repugnancy	1
between	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
taxation	1
in	1
the	1
States	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Union,	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
supported	1
in	1
that	1
sense	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
requisite	1
to	1
work	1
an	1
exclusion	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
It	1
is,	1
indeed,	1
possible	1
that	1
a	1
tax	1
might	1
be	1
laid	1
on	1
a	1
particular	1
article	1
by	1
a	1
State	1
which	1
might	1
render	1
it	1
INEXPEDIENT	1
that	1
thus	1
a	1
further	1
tax	1
should	1
be	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
article	1
by	1
the	1
Union;	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
imply	1
a	1
constitutional	1
inability	1
to	1
impose	1
a	1
further	1
tax.	1
The	1
quantity	1
of	1
the	1
imposition,	1
the	1
expediency	1
or	1
inexpediency	1
of	1
an	1
increase	1
on	1
either	1
side,	1
would	1
be	1
mutually	1
questions	1
of	1
prudence;	1
but	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
involved	1
no	1
direct	1
contradiction	1
of	1
power.	1
The	1
particular	1
policy	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
systems	1
of	1
finance	1
might	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
not	1
exactly	1
coincide,	1
and	1
might	1
require	1
reciprocal	1
forbearances.	1
It	1
is	1
not,	1
however	1
a	1
mere	1
possibility	1
of	1
inconvenience	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
powers,	1
but	1
an	1
immediate	1
constitutional	1
repugnancy	1
that	1
can	1
by	1
implication	1
alienate	1
and	1
extinguish	1
a	1
pre-existing	1
right	1
of	1
sovereignty.	1
The	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
concurrent	1
jurisdiction	1
in	1
certain	1
cases	1
results	1
from	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
sovereign	1
power;	1
and	1
the	1
rule	1
that	1
all	1
authorities,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
States	1
are	1
not	1
explicitly	1
divested	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
remain	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
full	1
vigor,	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
theoretical	1
consequence	1
of	1
that	1
division,	1
but	1
is	1
clearly	1
admitted	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
tenor	1
of	1
the	1
instrument	1
which	1
contains	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution.	1
We	1
there	1
find	1
that,	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
affirmative	1
grants	1
of	1
general	1
authorities,	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
pointed	1
care	1
in	1
those	1
cases	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
deemed	1
improper	1
that	1
the	1
like	1
authorities	1
should	1
reside	1
in	1
the	1
States,	1
to	1
insert	1
negative	1
clauses	1
prohibiting	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
States.	1
The	1
tenth	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
article	1
consists	1
altogether	1
of	1
such	1
provisions.	1
This	1
circumstance	1
is	1
a	1
clear	1
indication	1
of	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
and	1
furnishes	1
a	1
rule	1
of	1
interpretation	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
act,	1
which	1
justifies	1
the	1
position	1
I	1
have	1
advanced	1
and	1

every	1
hypothesis	1
to	1
the	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1

York:	1
THE	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
argument	1
against	1
the	1
provisions	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
taxation	1
is	1
ingrafted	1
upon	1
the	1
following	1
clause.	1
The	1
last	1
clause	1
of	1
the	1
eighth	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
article	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
under	1
consideration	1
authorizes	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
"to	1
make	1
all	1
laws	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
NECESSARY	1
and	1
PROPER	1
for	1
carrying	1
into	1
execution	1
THE	1
POWERS	1
by	1
that	1
Constitution	1
vested	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
department	1
or	1
officer	1
thereof";	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
clause	1
of	1
the	1
sixth	1
article	1
declares,	1
"that	1
the	1
Constitution	1
and	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
made	1
IN	1
PURSUANCE	1
THEREOF,	1
and	1
the	1
treaties	1
made	1
by	1
their	1
authority	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
SUPREME	1
LAW	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
constitution	1
or	1
laws	1
of	1
any	1
State	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
notwithstanding."	1
These	1
two	1
clauses	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
much	1
virulent	1
invective	1
and	1
petulant	1
declamation	1
against	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution.	1
They	1
have	1
been	1
held	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
exaggerated	1
colors	1
of	1
misrepresentation	1
as	1
the	1
pernicious	1
engines	1
by	1
which	1
their	1
local	1
governments	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
destroyed	1
and	1
their	1
liberties	1
exterminated;	1
as	1
the	1
hideous	1
monster	1
whose	1
devouring	1
jaws	1
would	1
spare	1
neither	1
sex	1
nor	1
age,	1
nor	1
high	1
nor	1
low,	1
nor	1
sacred	1
nor	1
profane;	1
and	1
yet,	1
strange	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
appear,	1
after	1
all	1
this	1
clamor,	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
contemplate	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
light,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
affirmed	1
with	1
perfect	1
confidence	1
that	1
the	1
constitutional	1
operation	1
of	1
the	1
intended	1
government	1
would	1
be	1
precisely	1
the	1
same,	1
if	1
these	1
clauses	1
were	1
entirely	1
obliterated,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
repeated	1
in	1
every	1
article.	1
They	1
are	1
only	1
declaratory	1
of	1
a	1
truth	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
resulted	1
by	1
necessary	1
and	1
unavoidable	1
implication	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
act	1
of	1
constituting	1
a	1
federal	1
government,	1
and	1
vesting	1
it	1
with	1
certain	1
specified	1
powers.	1
This	1
is	1
so	1
clear	1
a	1
proposition,	1
that	1
moderation	1
itself	1
can	1
scarcely	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
railings	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
copiously	1
vented	1
against	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
plan,	1
without	1
emotions	1
that	1
disturb	1
its	1
equanimity.	1
What	1
is	1
a	1
power,	1
but	1
the	1
ability	1
or	1
faculty	1
of	1
doing	1
a	1
thing?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
ability	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
thing,	1
but	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
employing	1
the	1
MEANS	1
necessary	1
to	1
its	1
execution?	1
What	1
is	1
a	1
LEGISLATIVE	1
power,	1
but	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
LAWS?	1
What	1
are	1
the	1
MEANS	1
to	1
execute	1
a	1
LEGISLATIVE	1
power	1
but	1
LAWS?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
laying	1
and	1
collecting	1
taxes,	1
but	1
a	1
LEGISLATIVE	1
POWER,	1
or	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
MAKING	1
LAWS,	1
to	1
lay	1
and	1
collect	1
taxes?	1
What	1
are	1
the	1
proper	1
means	1
of	1
executing	1
such	1
a	1
power,	1
but	1
NECESSARY	1
and	1
PROPER	1
laws?	1
This	1
simple	1
train	1
of	1
inquiry	1
furnishes	1
us	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
a	1
test	1
by	1
which	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
clause	1
complained	1
of.	1
It	1
conducts	1
us	1
to	1
this	1
palpable	1
truth,	1
that	1
a	1
power	1
to	1
lay	1
and	1
collect	1
taxes	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
power	1
to	1
pass	1
all	1
laws	1
NECESSARY	1
and	1
PROPER	1
for	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
that	1
power;	1
and	1
what	1
does	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
and	1
culumniated	1
provision	1
in	1
question	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
declare	1
the	1
same	1
truth,	1
to	1
wit,	1
that	1
the	1
national	1
legislature,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
laying	1
and	1
collecting	1
taxes	1
had	1
been	1
previously	1
given,	1
might,	1
in	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
that	1
power,	1
pass	1
all	1
laws	1
NECESSARY	1
and	1
PROPER	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
into	1
effect?	1
I	1
have	1
applied	1
these	1
observations	1
thus	1
particularly	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
taxation,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
immediate	1
subject	1
under	1
consideration,	1
and	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
of	1
the	1
authorities	1
proposed	1
to	1
be	1
conferred	1
upon	1
the	1
Union.	1
But	1
the	1
same	1
process	1
will	1
lead	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
result,	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
all	1
other	1
powers	1
declared	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
EXPRESSLY	1
to	1
execute	1
these	1
powers	1
that	1
the	1
sweeping	1
clause,	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
affectedly	1
called,	1
authorizes	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
to	1
pass	1
all	1
NECESSARY	1
and	1
PROPER	1
laws.	1
If	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
thing	1
exceptionable,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
sought	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
specific	1
powers	1
upon	1
which	1
this	1
general	1
declaration	1
is	1
predicated.	1
The	1
declaration	1
itself,	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
chargeable	1
with	1
tautology	1
or	1
redundancy,	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
perfectly	1
harmless.	1
But	1
SUSPICION	1
may	1
ask,	1
Why	1
then	1
was	1
it	1
introduced?	1
The	1
answer	1
is,	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
only	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
for	1
greater	1
caution,	1
and	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
all	1
cavilling	1
refinements	1
in	1
those	1
who	1
might	1
hereafter	1
feel	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
curtail	1
and	1
evade	1
the	1
legitimate	1
authorities	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
The	1
Convention	1
probably	1
foresaw,	1
what	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
principal	1
aim	1
of	1
these	1
papers	1
to	1
inculcate,	1
that	1
the	1
danger	1
which	1
most	1
threatens	1
our	1
political	1
welfare	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
will	1
finally	1
sap	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
the	1
Union;	1
and	1
might	1
therefore	1
think	1
it	1
necessary,	1
in	1
so	1
cardinal	1
a	1
point,	1
to	1
leave	1
nothing	1
to	1
construction.	1
Whatever	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
inducement	1
to	1
it,	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
precaution	1
is	1
evident	1
from	1
the	1
cry	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
raised	1
against	1
it;	1
as	1
that	1
very	1
cry	1
betrays	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
question	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
essential	1
truth	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
manifestly	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
that	1
provision	1
to	1
declare.	1
But	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
again	1
asked,	1
Who	1
is	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
NECESSITY	1
and	1
PROPRIETY	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
to	1
be	1
passed	1
for	1
executing	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
Union?	1
I	1
answer,	1
first,	1
that	1
this	1
question	1
arises	1
as	1
well	1
and	1
as	1
fully	1
upon	1
the	1
simple	1
grant	1
of	1
those	1
powers	1
as	1
upon	1
the	1
declaratory	1
clause;	1
and	1
I	1
answer,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
place,	1
that	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
like	1
every	1
other,	1
must	1
judge,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance,	1
of	1
the	1
proper	1
exercise	1
of	1
its	1
powers,	1
and	1
its	1
constituents	1
in	1
the	1
last.	1
If	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
should	1
overpass	1
the	1
just	1
bounds	1
of	1
its	1
authority	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
tyrannical	1
use	1
of	1
its	1
powers,	1
the	1
people,	1
whose	1
creature	1
it	1
is,	1
must	1
appeal	1
to	1
the	1
standard	1
they	1
have	1
formed,	1
and	1
take	1
such	1
measures	1
to	1
redress	1
the	1
injury	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
Constitution	1
as	1
the	1
exigency	1
may	1
suggest	1
and	1
prudence	1
justify.	1
The	1
propriety	1
of	1
a	1
law,	1
in	1
a	1
constitutional	1
light,	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
determined	1
by	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
powers	1
upon	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
founded.	1
Suppose,	1
by	1
some	1
forced	1
constructions	1
of	1
its	1
authority	1
(which,	1
indeed,	1
cannot	1
easily	1
be	1
imagined),	1
the	1
Federal	1
legislature	1
should	1
attempt	1
to	1
vary	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
descent	1
in	1
any	1
State,	1
would	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
evident	1
that,	1
in	1
making	1
such	1
an	1
attempt,	1
it	1
had	1
exceeded	1
its	1
jurisdiction,	1
and	1
infringed	1
upon	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
State?	1
Suppose,	1
again,	1
that	1
upon	1
the	1
pretense	1
of	1
an	1
interference	1
with	1
its	1
revenues,	1
it	1
should	1
undertake	1
to	1
abrogate	1
a	1
landtax	1
imposed	1
by	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
a	1
State;	1
would	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
equally	1
evident	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
an	1
invasion	1
of	1
that	1
concurrent	1
jurisdiction	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
this	1
species	1
of	1
tax,	1
which	1
its	1
Constitution	1
plainly	1
supposes	1
to	1
exist	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
governments?	1
If	1
there	1
ever	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
doubt	1
on	1
this	1
head,	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
entirely	1
due	1
to	1
those	1
reasoners	1
who,	1
in	1
the	1
imprudent	1
zeal	1
of	1
their	1
animosity	1
to	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
have	1
labored	1
to	1
envelop	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
cloud	1
calculated	1
to	1
obscure	1
the	1
plainest	1
and	1
simplest	1
truths.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
SUPREME	1
LAW	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
But	1
what	1
inference	1
can	1
be	1
drawn	1
from	1
this,	1
or	1
what	1
would	1
they	1
amount	1
to,	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supreme?	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
they	1
would	1
amount	1
to	1
nothing.	1
A	1
LAW,	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
term,	1
includes	1
supremacy.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
rule	1
which	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
prescribed	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
observe.	1
This	1
results	1
from	1
every	1
political	1
association.	1
If	1
individuals	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
society,	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
that	1
society	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
supreme	1
regulator	1
of	1
their	1
conduct.	1
If	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
political	1
societies	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
larger	1
political	1
society,	1
the	1
laws	1
which	1
the	1
latter	1
may	1
enact,	1
pursuant	1
to	1
the	1
powers	1
intrusted	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
its	1
constitution,	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
supreme	1
over	1
those	1
societies,	1
and	1
the	1
individuals	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
are	1
composed.	1
It	1
would	1
otherwise	1
be	1
a	1
mere	1
treaty,	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
good	1
faith	1
of	1
the	1
parties,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
government,	1
which	1
is	1
only	1
another	1
word	1
for	1
POLITICAL	1
POWER	1
AND	1
SUPREMACY.	1
But	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
follow	1
from	1
this	1
doctrine	1
that	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
society	1
which	1
are	1
NOT	1
PURSUANT	1
to	1
its	1
constitutional	1
powers,	1
but	1
which	1
are	1
invasions	1
of	1
the	1
residuary	1
authorities	1
of	1
the	1
smaller	1
societies,	1
will	1
become	1
the	1
supreme	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
These	1
will	1
be	1
merely	1
acts	1
of	1
usurpation,	1
and	1
will	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
treated	1
as	1
such.	1
Hence	1
we	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
clause	1
which	1
declares	1
the	1
supremacy	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
like	1
the	1
one	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
before	1
considered,	1
only	1
declares	1
a	1
truth,	1
which	1
flows	1
immediately	1
and	1
necessarily	1
from	1
the	1
institution	1
of	1
a	1
federal	1
government.	1
It	1
will	1
not,	1
I	1
presume,	1
have	1
escaped	1
observation,	1
that	1
it	1
EXPRESSLY	1
confines	1
this	1
supremacy	1
to	1
laws	1
made	1
PURSUANT	1
TO	1
THE	1
CONSTITUTION;	1
which	1
I	1
mention	1
merely	1
as	1
an	1
instance	1
of	1
caution	1
in	1
the	1
convention;	1
since	1
that	1
limitation	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
be	1
understood,	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
expressed.	1
Though	1
a	1
law,	1
therefore,	1
laying	1
a	1
tax	1
for	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
would	1
be	1
supreme	1
in	1
its	1
nature,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
legally	1
be	1
opposed	1
or	1
controlled,	1
yet	1
a	1
law	1
for	1
abrogating	1
or	1
preventing	1
the	1
collection	1
of	1
a	1
tax	1
laid	1
by	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
State,	1
(unless	1
upon	1
imports	1
and	1
exports),	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
supreme	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
land,	1
but	1
a	1
usurpation	1
of	1
power	1
not	1
granted	1
by	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
an	1
improper	1
accumulation	1
of	1
taxes	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
object	1
might	1
tend	1
to	1
render	1
the	1
collection	1
difficult	1
or	1
precarious,	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
mutual	1
inconvenience,	1
not	1
arising	1
from	1
a	1
superiority	1
or	1
defect	1
of	1
power	1
on	1
either	1
side,	1
but	1
from	1
an	1
injudicious	1
exercise	1
of	1
power	1
by	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other,	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
equally	1
disadvantageous	1
to	1
both.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
hoped	1
and	1
presumed,	1
however,	1
that	1
mutual	1
interest	1
would	1
dictate	1
a	1
concert	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
which	1
would	1
avoid	1
any	1
material	1
inconvenience.	1
The	1
inference	1
from	1
the	1
whole	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
individual	1
States	1
would,	1
under	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
retain	1
an	1
independent	1
and	1
uncontrollable	1
authority	1
to	1
raise	1
revenue	1
to	1
any	1
extent	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
may	1
stand	1
in	1
need,	1
by	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
taxation,	1
except	1
duties	1
on	1
imports	1
and	1
exports.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
shown	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
paper	1
that	1
this	1
CONCURRENT	1
JURISDICTION	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
taxation	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
admissible	1
substitute	1
for	1
an	1
entire	1
subordination,	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
this	1
branch	1
of	1
power,	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
authority	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
I	1
FLATTER	1
myself	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
clearly	1
shown	1
in	1
my	1
last	1
number	1
that	1
the	1
particular	1
States,	1
under	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
would	1
have	1
COEQUAL	1
authority	1
with	1
the	1
Union	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
revenue,	1
except	1
as	1
to	1
duties	1
on	1
imports.	1
As	1
this	1
leaves	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
States	1
far	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
community,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
color	1
for	1
the	1
assertion	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
possess	1
means	1
as	1
abundant	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
desired	1
for	1
the	1
supply	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
wants,	1
independent	1
of	1
all	1
external	1
control.	1
That	1
the	1
field	1
is	1
sufficiently	1
wide	1
will	1
more	1
fully	1
appear	1
when	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
advert	1
to	1
the	1
inconsiderable	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
expenses	1
for	1
which	1
it	1
will	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
to	1
provide.	1
To	1
argue	1
upon	1
abstract	1
principles	1
that	1
this	1
co-ordinate	1
authority	1
cannot	1
exist,	1
is	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
supposition	1
and	1
theory	1
against	1
fact	1
and	1
reality.	1
However	1
proper	1
such	1
reasonings	1
might	1
be	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
a	1
thing	1
OUGHT	1
NOT	1
TO	1
EXIST,	1
they	1
are	1
wholly	1
to	1
be	1
rejected	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
exist	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
itself.	1
It	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
Roman	1
republic	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
resort,	1
resided	1
for	1
ages	1
in	1
two	1
different	1
political	1
bodies	1
not	1
as	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
legislature,	1
but	1
as	1
distinct	1
and	1
independent	1
legislatures,	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
which	1
an	1
opposite	1
interest	1
prevailed:	1
in	1
one	1
the	1
patrician;	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
plebian.	1
Many	1
arguments	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
adduced	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1
unfitness	1
of	1
two	1
such	1
seemingly	1
contradictory	1
authorities,	1
each	1
having	1
power	1
to	1
ANNUL	1
or	1
REPEAL	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
But	1
a	1
man	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
regarded	1
as	1
frantic	1
who	1
should	1
have	1
attempted	1
at	1
Rome	1
to	1
disprove	1
their	1
existence.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
readily	1
understood	1
that	1
I	1
allude	1
to	1
the	1
COMITIA	1
CENTURIATA	1
and	1
the	1
COMITIA	1
TRIBUTA.	1
The	1
former,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
people	1
voted	1
by	1
centuries,	1
was	1
so	1
arranged	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
superiority	1
to	1
the	1
patrician	1
interest;	1
in	1
the	1
latter,	1
in	1
which	1
numbers	1
prevailed,	1
the	1
plebian	1
interest	1
had	1
an	1
entire	1
predominancy.	1
And	1
yet	1
these	1
two	1
legislatures	1
coexisted	1
for	1
ages,	1
and	1
the	1
Roman	1
republic	1
attained	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
height	1
of	1
human	1
greatness.	1
In	1
the	1
case	1
particularly	1
under	1
consideration,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
such	1
contradiction	1
as	1
appears	1
in	1
the	1
example	1
cited;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
power	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
to	1
annul	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
And	1
in	1
practice	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
reason	1
to	1
apprehend	1
any	1
inconvenience;	1
because,	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
course	1
of	1
time,	1
the	1
wants	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
will	1
naturally	1
reduce	1
themselves	1
within	1
A	1
VERY	1
NARROW	1
COMPASS;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
interim,	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
will,	1
in	1
all	1
probability,	1
find	1
it	1
convenient	1
to	1
abstain	1
wholly	1
from	1
those	1
objects	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
particular	1
States	1
would	1
be	1
inclined	1
to	1
resort.	1
To	1
form	1
a	1
more	1
precise	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
merits	1
of	1
this	1
question,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
to	1
advert	1
to	1
the	1
proportion	1
between	1
the	1
objects	1
that	1
will	1
require	1
a	1
federal	1
provision	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
revenue,	1
and	1
those	1
which	1
will	1
require	1
a	1
State	1
provision.	1
We	1
shall	1
discover	1
that	1
the	1
former	1
are	1
altogether	1
unlimited,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
are	1
circumscribed	1
within	1
very	1
moderate	1
bounds.	1
In	1
pursuing	1
this	1
inquiry,	1
we	1
must	1
bear	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
confine	1
our	1
view	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
period,	1
but	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
remote	1
futurity.	1
Constitutions	1
of	1
civil	1
government	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
framed	1
upon	1
a	1
calculation	1
of	1
existing	1
exigencies,	1
but	1
upon	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
these	1
with	1
the	1
probable	1
exigencies	1
of	1
ages,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
natural	1
and	1
tried	1
course	1
of	1
human	1
affairs.	1
Nothing,	1
therefore,	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
fallacious	1
than	1
to	1
infer	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
any	1
power,	1
proper	1
to	1
be	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
from	1
an	1
estimate	1
of	1
its	1
immediate	1
necessities.	1
There	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
CAPACITY	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
future	1
contingencies	1
as	1
they	1
may	1
happen;	1
and	1
as	1
these	1
are	1
illimitable	1
in	1
their	1
nature,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
safely	1
to	1
limit	1
that	1
capacity.	1
It	1
is	1
true,	1
perhaps,	1
that	1
a	1
computation	1
might	1
be	1
made	1
with	1
sufficient	1
accuracy	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
revenue	1
requisite	1
to	1
discharge	1
the	1
subsisting	1
engagements	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
to	1
maintain	1
those	1
establishments	1
which,	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
would	1
suffice	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace.	1
But	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
wise,	1
or	1
would	1
it	1
not	1
rather	1
be	1
the	1
extreme	1
of	1
folly,	1
to	1
stop	1
at	1
this	1
point,	1
and	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
government	1
intrusted	1
with	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
defense	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
absolute	1
incapacity	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
against	1
future	1
invasions	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
peace,	1
by	1
foreign	1
war	1
or	1
domestic	1
convulsions?	1
If,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
exceed	1
this	1
point,	1
where	1
can	1
we	1
stop,	1
short	1
of	1
an	1
indefinite	1
power	1
of	1
providing	1
for	1
emergencies	1
as	1
they	1
may	1
arise?	1
Though	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
assert,	1
in	1
general	1
terms,	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
forming	1
a	1
rational	1
judgment	1
of	1
a	1
due	1
provision	1
against	1
probable	1
dangers,	1
yet	1
we	1
may	1
safely	1
challenge	1
those	1
who	1
make	1
the	1
assertion	1
to	1
bring	1
forward	1
their	1
data,	1
and	1
may	1
affirm	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
found	1
as	1
vague	1
and	1
uncertain	1
as	1
any	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
produced	1
to	1
establish	1
the	1
probable	1
duration	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Observations	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
mere	1
prospects	1
of	1
internal	1
attacks	1
can	1
deserve	1
no	1
weight;	1
though	1
even	1
these	1
will	1
admit	1
of	1
no	1
satisfactory	1
calculation:	1
but	1
if	1
we	1
mean	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
commercial	1
people,	1
it	1
must	1
form	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
policy	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
one	1
day	1
to	1
defend	1
that	1
commerce.	1
The	1
support	1
of	1
a	1
navy	1
and	1
of	1
naval	1
wars	1
would	1
involve	1
contingencies	1
that	1
must	1
baffle	1
all	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
political	1
arithmetic.	1
Admitting	1
that	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
novel	1
and	1
absurd	1
experiment	1
in	1
politics	1
of	1
tying	1
up	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
government	1
from	1
offensive	1
war	1
founded	1
upon	1
reasons	1
of	1
state,	1
yet	1
certainly	1
we	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
disable	1
it	1
from	1
guarding	1
the	1
community	1
against	1
the	1
ambition	1
or	1
enmity	1
of	1
other	1
nations.	1
A	1
cloud	1
has	1
been	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
hanging	1
over	1
the	1
European	1
world.	1
If	1
it	1
should	1
break	1
forth	1
into	1
a	1
storm,	1
who	1
can	1
insure	1
us	1
that	1
in	1
its	1
progress	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
its	1
fury	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
spent	1
upon	1
us?	1
No	1
reasonable	1
man	1
would	1
hastily	1
pronounce	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
entirely	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
reach.	1
Or	1
if	1
the	1
combustible	1
materials	1
that	1
now	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
collecting	1
should	1
be	1
dissipated	1
without	1
coming	1
to	1
maturity,	1
or	1
if	1
a	1
flame	1
should	1
be	1
kindled	1
without	1
extending	1
to	1
us,	1
what	1
security	1
can	1
we	1
have	1
that	1
our	1
tranquillity	1
will	1
long	1
remain	1
undisturbed	1
from	1
some	1
other	1
cause	1
or	1
from	1
some	1
other	1
quarter?	1
Let	1
us	1
recollect	1
that	1
peace	1
or	1
war	1
will	1
not	1
always	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
our	1
option;	1
that	1
however	1
moderate	1
or	1
unambitious	1
we	1
may	1
be,	1
we	1
cannot	1
count	1
upon	1
the	1
moderation,	1
or	1
hope	1
to	1
extinguish	1
the	1
ambition	1
of	1
others.	1
Who	1
could	1
have	1
imagined	1
at	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
war	1
that	1
France	1
and	1
Britain,	1
wearied	1
and	1
exhausted	1
as	1
they	1
both	1
were,	1
would	1
so	1
soon	1
have	1
looked	1
with	1
so	1
hostile	1
an	1
aspect	1
upon	1
each	1
other?	1
To	1
judge	1
from	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
mankind,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
compelled	1
to	1
conclude	1
that	1
the	1
fiery	1
and	1
destructive	1
passions	1
of	1
war	1
reign	1
in	1
the	1
human	1
breast	1
with	1
much	1
more	1
powerful	1
sway	1
than	1
the	1
mild	1
and	1
beneficent	1
sentiments	1
of	1
peace;	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
model	1
our	1
political	1
systems	1
upon	1
speculations	1
of	1
lasting	1
tranquillity,	1
is	1
to	1
calculate	1
on	1
the	1
weaker	1
springs	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
character.	1
What	1
are	1
the	1
chief	1
sources	1
of	1
expense	1
in	1
every	1
government?	1
What	1
has	1
occasioned	1
that	1
enormous	1
accumulation	1
of	1
debts	1
with	1
which	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
European	1
nations	1
are	1
oppressed?	1
The	1
answers	1
plainly	1
is,	1
wars	1
and	1
rebellions;	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
those	1
institutions	1
which	1
are	1
necessary	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
body	1
politic	1
against	1
these	1
two	1
most	1
mortal	1
diseases	1
of	1
society.	1
The	1
expenses	1
arising	1
from	1
those	1
institutions	1
which	1
are	1
relative	1
to	1
the	1
mere	1
domestic	1
police	1
of	1
a	1
state,	1
to	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
its	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judicial	1
departments,	1
with	1
their	1
different	1
appendages,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
encouragement	1
of	1
agriculture	1
and	1
manufactures	1
(which	1
will	1
comprehend	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
state	1
expenditure),	1
are	1
insignificant	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
those	1
which	1
relate	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
defense.	1
In	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
where	1
all	1
the	1
ostentatious	1
apparatus	1
of	1
monarchy	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
provided	1
for,	1
not	1
above	1
a	1
fifteenth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
annual	1
income	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
is	1
appropriated	1
to	1
the	1
class	1
of	1
expenses	1
last	1
mentioned;	1
the	1
other	1
fourteen	1
fifteenths	1
are	1
absorbed	1
in	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
debts	1
contracted	1
for	1
carrying	1
on	1
the	1
wars	1
in	1
which	1
that	1
country	1
has	1
been	1
engaged,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
maintenance	1
of	1
fleets	1
and	1
armies.	1
If,	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
observed	1
that	1
the	1
expenses	1
incurred	1
in	1
the	1
prosecution	1
of	1
the	1
ambitious	1
enterprises	1
and	1
vainglorious	1
pursuits	1
of	1
a	1
monarchy	1
are	1
not	1
a	1
proper	1
standard	1
by	1
which	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
necessary	1
in	1
a	1
republic,	1
it	1
ought,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
to	1
be	1
remarked	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
disproportion	1
between	1
the	1
profusion	1
and	1
extravagance	1
of	1
a	1
wealthy	1
kingdom	1
in	1
its	1
domestic	1
administration,	1
and	1
the	1
frugality	1
and	1
economy	1
which	1
in	1
that	1
particular	1
become	1
the	1
modest	1
simplicity	1
of	1
republican	1
government.	1
If	1
we	1
balance	1
a	1
proper	1
deduction	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
against	1
that	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
supposed	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
from	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
proportion	1
may	1
still	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
holding	1
good.	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
advert	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
debt	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
ourselves	1
contracted	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
war,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
only	1
calculate	1
on	1
a	1
common	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
events	1
which	1
disturb	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
nations,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
instantly	1
perceive,	1
without	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
any	1
elaborate	1
illustration,	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
an	1
immense	1
disproportion	1
between	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
federal	1
and	1
state	1
expenditures.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
separately,	1
are	1
encumbered	1
with	1
considerable	1
debts,	1
which	1
are	1
an	1
excrescence	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
war.	1
But	1
this	1
cannot	1
happen	1
again,	1
if	1
the	1
proposed	1
system	1
be	1
adopted;	1
and	1
when	1
these	1
debts	1
are	1
discharged,	1
the	1
only	1
call	1
for	1
revenue	1
of	1
any	1
consequence,	1
which	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
will	1
continue	1
to	1
experience,	1
will	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
mere	1
support	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
civil	1
list;	1
to	1
which,	1
if	1
we	1
add	1
all	1
contingencies,	1
the	1
total	1
amount	1
in	1
every	1
State	1
ought	1
to	1
fall	1
considerably	1
short	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
pounds.	1
In	1
framing	1
a	1
government	1
for	1
posterity	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
ourselves,	1
we	1
ought,	1
in	1
those	1
provisions	1
which	1
are	1
designed	1
to	1
be	1
permanent,	1
to	1
calculate,	1
not	1
on	1
temporary,	1
but	1
on	1
permanent	1
causes	1
of	1
expense.	1
If	1
this	1
principle	1
be	1
a	1
just	1
one	1
our	1
attention	1
would	1
be	1
directed	1
to	1
a	1
provision	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
for	1
an	1
annual	1
sum	1
of	1
about	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
pounds;	1
while	1
the	1
exigencies	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
could	1
be	1
susceptible	1
of	1
no	1
limits,	1
even	1
in	1
imagination.	1
In	1
this	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
subject,	1
by	1
what	1
logic	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
maintained	1
that	1
the	1
local	1
governments	1
ought	1
to	1
command,	1
in	1
perpetuity,	1
an	1
EXCLUSIVE	1
source	1
of	1
revenue	1
for	1
any	1
sum	1
beyond	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
pounds?	1
To	1
extend	1
its	1
power	1
further,	1
in	1
EXCLUSION	1
of	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
hands	1
which	1
stood	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
welfare,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
into	1
other	1
hands	1
which	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
just	1
or	1
proper	1
occasion	1
for	1
them.	1
Suppose,	1
then,	1
the	1
convention	1
had	1
been	1
inclined	1
to	1
proceed	1
upon	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
a	1
repartition	1
of	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
revenue,	1
between	1
the	1
Union	1
and	1
its	1
members,	1
in	1
PROPORTION	1
to	1
their	1
comparative	1
necessities;	1
what	1
particular	1
fund	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
selected	1
for	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
either	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
much	1
or	1
too	1
little	1
too	1
little	1
for	1
their	1
present,	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
their	1
future	1
wants?	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
separation	1
between	1
external	1
and	1
internal	1
taxes,	1
this	1
would	1
leave	1
to	1
the	1
States,	1
at	1
a	1
rough	1
computation,	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
to	1
defray	1
from	1
a	1
tenth	1
to	1
a	1
twentieth	1
part	1
of	1
its	1
expenses;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
Union,	1
one	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
community,	1
to	1
defray	1
from	1
nine	1
tenths	1
to	1
nineteen	1
twentieths	1
of	1
its	1
expenses.	1
If	1
we	1
desert	1
this	1
boundary	1
and	1
content	1
ourselves	1
with	1
leaving	1
to	1
the	1
States	1
an	1
exclusive	1
power	1
of	1
taxing	1
houses	1
and	1
lands,	1
there	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
disproportion	1
between	1
the	1
MEANS	1
and	1
the	1
END;	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
one	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
to	1
supply,	1
at	1
most,	1
one	1
tenth	1
of	1
its	1
wants.	1
If	1
any	1
fund	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
selected	1
and	1
appropriated,	1
equal	1
to	1
and	1
not	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
object,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
inadequate	1
to	1
the	1
discharge	1
of	1
the	1
existing	1
debts	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
States,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
left	1
them	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
Union	1
for	1
a	1
provision	1
for	1
this	1
purpose.	1
The	1
preceding	1
train	1
of	1
observation	1
will	1
justify	1
the	1
position	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
elsewhere	1
laid	1
down,	1
that	1
"A	1
CONCURRENT	1
JURISDICTION	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
taxation	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
admissible	1
substitute	1
for	1
an	1
entire	1
subordination,	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
this	1
branch	1
of	1
power,	1
of	1
State	1
authority	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Union."	1
Any	1
separation	1
of	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
revenue	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
fallen	1
upon,	1

the	1
great	1
INTERESTS	1
of	1
the	1

to	1
the	1
POWER	1

the	1

The	1
convention	1
thought	1
the	1
concurrent	1
jurisdiction	1
preferable	1
to	1
that	1
subordination;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
reconciling	1
an	1
indefinite	1
constitutional	1
power	1
of	1
taxation	1
in	1
the	1
Federal	1
government	1
with	1
an	1
adequate	1
and	1
independent	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
States	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
necessities.	1
There	1
remain	1
a	1
few	1
other	1
lights,	1
in	1
which	1
this	1
important	1
subject	1
of	1
taxation	1
will	1
claim	1
a	1
further	1
consideration.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
BEFORE	1
we	1
proceed	1
to	1
examine	1
any	1
other	1
objections	1
to	1
an	1
indefinite	1
power	1
of	1
taxation	1
in	1
the	1
Union,	1
I	1
shall	1
make	1
one	1
general	1
remark;	1
which	1
is,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
revenue,	1
should	1
be	1
restricted	1
to	1
particular	1
objects,	1
it	1
would	1
naturally	1
occasion	1
an	1
undue	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
burdens	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
those	1
objects.	1
Two	1
evils	1
would	1
spring	1
from	1
this	1
source:	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
particular	1
branches	1
of	1
industry;	1
and	1
an	1
unequal	1
distribution	1
of	1
the	1
taxes,	1
as	1
well	1
among	1
the	1
several	1
States	1
as	1
among	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
State.	1
Suppose,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
contended	1
for,	1
the	1
federal	1
power	1
of	1
taxation	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
confined	1
to	1
duties	1
on	1
imports,	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
government,	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
command	1
other	1
resources,	1
would	1
frequently	1
be	1
tempted	1
to	1
extend	1
these	1
duties	1
to	1
an	1
injurious	1
excess.	1
There	1
are	1
persons	1
who	1
imagine	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
carried	1
to	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
length;	1
since	1
the	1
higher	1
they	1
are,	1
the	1
more	1
it	1
is	1
alleged	1
they	1
will	1
tend	1
to	1
discourage	1
an	1
extravagant	1
consumption,	1
to	1
produce	1
a	1
favorable	1
balance	1
of	1
trade,	1
and	1
to	1
promote	1
domestic	1
manufactures.	1
But	1
all	1
extremes	1
are	1
pernicious	1
in	1
various	1
ways.	1
Exorbitant	1
duties	1
on	1
imported	1
articles	1
would	1
beget	1
a	1
general	1
spirit	1
of	1
smuggling;	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
prejudicial	1
to	1
the	1
fair	1
trader,	1
and	1
eventually	1
to	1
the	1
revenue	1
itself:	1
they	1
tend	1
to	1
render	1
other	1
classes	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
tributary,	1
in	1
an	1
improper	1
degree,	1
to	1
the	1
manufacturing	1
classes,	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
give	1
a	1
premature	1
monopoly	1
of	1
the	1
markets;	1
they	1
sometimes	1
force	1
industry	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
more	1
natural	1
channels	1
into	1
others	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
flows	1
with	1
less	1
advantage;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
place,	1
they	1
oppress	1
the	1
merchant,	1
who	1
is	1
often	1
obliged	1
to	1
pay	1
them	1
himself	1
without	1
any	1
retribution	1
from	1
the	1
consumer.	1
When	1
the	1
demand	1
is	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
goods	1
at	1
market,	1
the	1
consumer	1
generally	1
pays	1
the	1
duty;	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
markets	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
overstocked,	1
a	1
great	1
proportion	1
falls	1
upon	1
the	1
merchant,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
not	1
only	1
exhausts	1
his	1
profits,	1
but	1
breaks	1
in	1
upon	1
his	1
capital.	1
I	1
am	1
apt	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
a	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
duty,	1
between	1
the	1
seller	1
and	1
the	1
buyer,	1
more	1
often	1
happens	1
than	1
is	1
commonly	1
imagined.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
always	1
possible	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
a	1
commodity	1
in	1
exact	1
proportion	1
to	1
every	1
additional	1
imposition	1
laid	1
upon	1
it.	1
The	1
merchant,	1
especially	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
of	1
small	1
commercial	1
capital,	1
is	1
often	1
under	1
a	1
necessity	1
of	1
keeping	1
prices	1
down	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
a	1
more	1
expeditious	1
sale.	1
The	1
maxim	1
that	1
the	1
consumer	1
is	1
the	1
payer,	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
oftener	1
true	1
than	1
the	1
reverse	1
of	1
the	1
proposition,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
far	1
more	1
equitable	1
that	1
the	1
duties	1
on	1
imports	1
should	1
go	1
into	1
a	1
common	1
stock,	1
than	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
redound	1
to	1
the	1
exclusive	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
importing	1
States.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
generally	1
true	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
it	1
equitable,	1
that	1
those	1
duties	1
should	1
form	1
the	1
only	1
national	1
fund.	1
When	1
they	1
are	1
paid	1
by	1
the	1
merchant	1
they	1
operate	1
as	1
an	1
additional	1
tax	1
upon	1
the	1
importing	1
State,	1
whose	1
citizens	1
pay	1
their	1
proportion	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
consumers.	1
In	1
this	1
view	1
they	1
are	1
productive	1
of	1
inequality	1
among	1
the	1
States;	1
which	1
inequality	1
would	1
be	1
increased	1
with	1
the	1
increased	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
duties.	1
The	1
confinement	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
revenues	1
to	1
this	1
species	1
of	1
imposts	1
would	1
be	1
attended	1
with	1
inequality,	1
from	1
a	1
different	1
cause,	1
between	1
the	1
manufacturing	1
and	1
the	1
non-manufacturing	1
States.	1
The	1
States	1
which	1
can	1
go	1
farthest	1
towards	1
the	1
supply	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
wants,	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
manufactures,	1
will	1
not,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
numbers	1
or	1
wealth,	1
consume	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
proportion	1
of	1
imported	1
articles	1
as	1
those	1
States	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
favorable	1
situation.	1
They	1
would	1
not,	1
therefore,	1
in	1
this	1
mode	1
alone	1
contribute	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
treasury	1
in	1
a	1
ratio	1
to	1
their	1
abilities.	1
To	1
make	1
them	1
do	1
this	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that	1
recourse	1
be	1
had	1
to	1
excises,	1
the	1
proper	1
objects	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
particular	1
kinds	1
of	1
manufactures.	1
New	1
York	1
is	1
more	1
deeply	1
interested	1
in	1
these	1
considerations	1
than	1
such	1
of	1
her	1
citizens	1
as	1
contend	1
for	1
limiting	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
to	1
external	1
taxation	1
may	1
be	1
aware	1
of.	1
New	1
York	1
is	1
an	1
importing	1
State,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
likely	1
speedily	1
to	1
be,	1
to	1
any	1
great	1
extent,	1
a	1
manufacturing	1
State.	1
She	1
would,	1
of	1
course,	1
suffer	1
in	1
a	1
double	1
light	1
from	1
restraining	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
to	1
commercial	1
imposts.	1
So	1
far	1
as	1
these	1
observations	1
tend	1
to	1
inculcate	1
a	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
import	1
duties	1
being	1
extended	1
to	1
an	1
injurious	1
extreme	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
observed,	1
conformably	1
to	1
a	1
remark	1
made	1
in	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
these	1
papers,	1
that	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
revenue	1
itself	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
sufficient	1
guard	1
against	1
such	1
an	1
extreme.	1
I	1
readily	1
admit	1
that	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
other	1
resources	1
were	1
open;	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
avenues	1
to	1
them	1
were	1
closed,	1
HOPE,	1
stimulated	1
by	1
necessity,	1
would	1
beget	1
experiments,	1
fortified	1
by	1
rigorous	1
precautions	1
and	1
additional	1
penalties,	1
which,	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
intended	1
effect,	1
till	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
leisure	1
to	1
contrive	1
expedients	1
to	1
elude	1
these	1
new	1
precautions.	1
The	1
first	1
success	1
would	1
be	1
apt	1
to	1
inspire	1
false	1
opinions,	1
which	1
it	1
might	1
require	1
a	1
long	1
course	1
of	1
subsequent	1
experience	1
to	1
correct.	1
Necessity,	1
especially	1
in	1
politics,	1
often	1
occasions	1
false	1
hopes,	1
false	1
reasonings,	1
and	1
a	1
system	1
of	1
measures	1
correspondingly	1
erroneous.	1
But	1
even	1
if	1
this	1
supposed	1
excess	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
limitation	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
power	1
of	1
taxation,	1
the	1
inequalities	1
spoken	1
of	1
would	1
still	1
ensue,	1
though	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
degree,	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
causes	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
noticed.	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
examination	1
of	1
objections.	1
One	1
which,	1
if	1
we	1
may	1
judge	1
from	1
the	1
frequency	1
of	1
its	1
repetition,	1
seems	1
most	1
to	1
be	1
relied	1
on,	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
is	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
numerous	1
for	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
different	1
classes	1
of	1
citizens,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
combine	1
the	1
interests	1
and	1
feelings	1
of	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
community,	1
and	1
to	1
produce	1
a	1
due	1
sympathy	1
between	1
the	1
representative	1
body	1
and	1
its	1
constituents.	1
This	1
argument	1
presents	1
itself	1
under	1
a	1
very	1
specious	1
and	1
seducing	1
form;	1
and	1
is	1
well	1
calculated	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
prejudices	1
of	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
addressed.	1
But	1
when	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
dissect	1
it	1
with	1
attention,	1
it	1
will	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
fair-sounding	1
words.	1
The	1
object	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
aim	1
at	1
is,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
impracticable,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
contended	1
for,	1
is	1
unnecessary.	1
I	1
reserve	1
for	1
another	1
place	1
the	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
which	1
relates	1
to	1
the	1
sufficiency	1
of	1
the	1
representative	1
body	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
numbers,	1
and	1
shall	1
content	1
myself	1
with	1
examining	1
here	1
the	1
particular	1
use	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
of	1
a	1
contrary	1
supposition,	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
immediate	1
subject	1
of	1
our	1
inquiries.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
an	1
actual	1
representation	1
of	1
all	1
classes	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
by	1
persons	1
of	1
each	1
class,	1
is	1
altogether	1
visionary.	1
Unless	1
it	1
were	1
expressly	1
provided	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
that	1
each	1
different	1
occupation	1
should	1
send	1
one	1
or	1
more	1
members,	1
the	1
thing	1
would	1
never	1
take	1
place	1
in	1
practice.	1
Mechanics	1
and	1
manufacturers	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
inclined,	1
with	1
few	1
exceptions,	1
to	1
give	1
their	1
votes	1
to	1
merchants,	1
in	1
preference	1
to	1
persons	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
professions	1
or	1
trades.	1
Those	1
discerning	1
citizens	1
are	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
the	1
mechanic	1
and	1
manufacturing	1
arts	1
furnish	1
the	1
materials	1
of	1
mercantile	1
enterprise	1
and	1
industry.	1
Many	1
of	1
them,	1
indeed,	1
are	1
immediately	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
commerce.	1
They	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
merchant	1
is	1
their	1
natural	1
patron	1
and	1
friend;	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
aware,	1
that	1
however	1
great	1
the	1
confidence	1
they	1
may	1
justly	1
feel	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
good	1
sense,	1
their	1
interests	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
effectually	1
promoted	1
by	1
the	1
merchant	1
than	1
by	1
themselves.	1
They	1
are	1
sensible	1
that	1
their	1
habits	1
in	1
life	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
those	1
acquired	1
endowments,	1
without	1
which,	1
in	1
a	1
deliberative	1
assembly,	1
the	1
greatest	1
natural	1
abilities	1
are	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
useless;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
influence	1
and	1
weight,	1
and	1
superior	1
acquirements	1
of	1
the	1
merchants	1
render	1
them	1
more	1
equal	1
to	1
a	1
contest	1
with	1
any	1
spirit	1
which	1
might	1
happen	1
to	1
infuse	1
itself	1
into	1
the	1
public	1
councils,	1
unfriendly	1
to	1
the	1
manufacturing	1
and	1
trading	1
interests.	1
These	1
considerations,	1
and	1
many	1
others	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
mentioned	1
prove,	1
and	1
experience	1
confirms	1
it,	1
that	1
artisans	1
and	1
manufacturers	1
will	1
commonly	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
bestow	1
their	1
votes	1
upon	1
merchants	1
and	1
those	1
whom	1
they	1
recommend.	1
We	1
must	1
therefore	1
consider	1
merchants	1
as	1
the	1
natural	1
representatives	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
classes	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
learned	1
professions,	1
little	1
need	1
be	1
observed;	1
they	1
truly	1
form	1
no	1
distinct	1
interest	1
in	1
society,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
situation	1
and	1
talents,	1
will	1
be	1
indiscriminately	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
the	1
confidence	1
and	1
choice	1
of	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
of	1
other	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
Nothing	1
remains	1
but	1
the	1
landed	1
interest;	1
and	1
this,	1
in	1
a	1
political	1
view,	1
and	1
particularly	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
taxes,	1
I	1
take	1
to	1
be	1
perfectly	1
united,	1
from	1
the	1
wealthiest	1
landlord	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
poorest	1
tenant.	1
No	1
tax	1
can	1
be	1
laid	1
on	1
land	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
affect	1
the	1
proprietor	1
of	1
millions	1
of	1
acres	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
proprietor	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
acre.	1
Every	1
landholder	1
will	1
therefore	1
have	1
a	1
common	1
interest	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
taxes	1
on	1
land	1
as	1
low	1
as	1
possible;	1
and	1
common	1
interest	1
may	1
always	1
be	1
reckoned	1
upon	1
as	1
the	1
surest	1
bond	1
of	1
sympathy.	1
But	1
if	1
we	1
even	1
could	1
suppose	1
a	1
distinction	1
of	1
interest	1
between	1
the	1
opulent	1
landholder	1
and	1
the	1
middling	1
farmer,	1
what	1
reason	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
conclude,	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
would	1
stand	1
a	1
better	1
chance	1
of	1
being	1
deputed	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
than	1
the	1
last?	1
If	1
we	1
take	1
fact	1
as	1
our	1
guide,	1
and	1
look	1
into	1
our	1
own	1
senate	1
and	1
assembly,	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
that	1
moderate	1
proprietors	1
of	1
land	1
prevail	1
in	1
both;	1
nor	1
is	1
this	1
less	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
the	1
senate,	1
which	1
consists	1
of	1
a	1
smaller	1
number,	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
assembly,	1
which	1
is	1
composed	1
of	1
a	1
greater	1
number.	1
Where	1
the	1
qualifications	1
of	1
the	1
electors	1
are	1
the	1
same,	1
whether	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
choose	1
a	1
small	1
or	1
a	1
large	1
number,	1
their	1
votes	1
will	1
fall	1
upon	1
those	1
in	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
most	1
confidence;	1
whether	1
these	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
men	1
of	1
large	1
fortunes,	1
or	1
of	1
moderate	1
property,	1
or	1
of	1
no	1
property	1
at	1
all.	1
It	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
be	1
necessary,	1
that	1
all	1
classes	1
of	1
citizens	1
should	1
have	1
some	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
number	1
in	1
the	1
representative	1
body,	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
their	1
feelings	1
and	1
interests	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
better	1
understood	1
and	1
attended	1
to.	1
But	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
never	1
happen	1
under	1
any	1
arrangement	1
that	1
leaves	1
the	1
votes	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
free.	1
Where	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
case,	1
the	1
representative	1
body,	1
with	1
too	1
few	1
exceptions	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
will	1
be	1
composed	1
of	1
landholders,	1
merchants,	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
learned	1
professions.	1
But	1
where	1
is	1
the	1
danger	1
that	1
the	1
interests	1
and	1
feelings	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
classes	1
of	1
citizens	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
understood	1
or	1
attended	1
to	1
by	1
these	1
three	1
descriptions	1
of	1
men?	1
Will	1
not	1
the	1
landholder	1
know	1
and	1
feel	1
whatever	1
will	1
promote	1
or	1
insure	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
landed	1
property?	1
And	1
will	1
he	1
not,	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
interest	1
in	1
that	1
species	1
of	1
property,	1
be	1
sufficiently	1
prone	1
to	1
resist	1
every	1
attempt	1
to	1
prejudice	1
or	1
encumber	1
it?	1
Will	1
not	1
the	1
merchant	1
understand	1
and	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
cultivate,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
proper,	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
mechanic	1
and	1
manufacturing	1
arts,	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
commerce	1
is	1
so	1
nearly	1
allied?	1
Will	1
not	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
learned	1
profession,	1
who	1
will	1
feel	1
a	1
neutrality	1
to	1
the	1
rivalships	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
branches	1
of	1
industry,	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
prove	1
an	1
impartial	1
arbiter	1
between	1
them,	1
ready	1
to	1
promote	1
either,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
shall	1
appear	1
to	1
him	1
conducive	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
society?	1
If	1
we	1
take	1
into	1
the	1
account	1
the	1
momentary	1
humors	1
or	1
dispositions	1
which	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
prevail	1
in	1
particular	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
society,	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
a	1
wise	1
administration	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
inattentive,	1
is	1
the	1
man	1
whose	1
situation	1
leads	1
to	1
extensive	1
inquiry	1
and	1
information	1
less	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
competent	1
judge	1
of	1
their	1
nature,	1
extent,	1
and	1
foundation	1
than	1
one	1
whose	1
observation	1
does	1
not	1
travel	1
beyond	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
his	1
neighbors	1
and	1
acquaintances?	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
natural	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
candidate	1
for	1
the	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
suffrages	1
of	1
his	1
fellow-citizens	1
for	1
the	1
continuance	1
of	1
his	1
public	1
honors,	1
should	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
inform	1
himself	1
of	1
their	1
dispositions	1
and	1
inclinations,	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
allow	1
them	1
their	1
proper	1
degree	1
of	1
influence	1
upon	1
his	1
conduct?	1
This	1
dependence,	1
and	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
being	1
bound	1
himself,	1
and	1
his	1
posterity,	1
by	1
the	1
laws	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
gives	1
his	1
assent,	1
are	1
the	1
true,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
strong	1
chords	1
of	1
sympathy	1
between	1
the	1
representative	1
and	1
the	1
constituent.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
government	1
that	1
requires	1
extensive	1
information	1
and	1
a	1
thorough	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
political	1
economy,	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
taxation.	1
The	1
man	1
who	1
understands	1
those	1
principles	1
best	1
will	1
be	1
least	1
likely	1
to	1
resort	1
to	1
oppressive	1
expedients,	1
or	1
sacrifice	1
any	1
particular	1
class	1
of	1
citizens	1
to	1
the	1
procurement	1
of	1
revenue.	1
It	1
might	1
be	1
demonstrated	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
productive	1
system	1
of	1
finance	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
the	1
least	1
burdensome.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
a	1
judicious	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
taxation,	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
person	1
in	1
whose	1
hands	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
genius,	1
habits,	1
and	1
modes	1
of	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
reasonably	1
meant	1
by	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
interests	1
and	1
feelings	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
In	1
any	1
other	1
sense	1
the	1
proposition	1
has	1
either	1
no	1
meaning,	1
or	1
an	1
absurd	1
one.	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
sense	1
let	1
every	1
considerate	1
citizen	1
judge	1
for	1
himself	1
where	1
the	1
requisite	1
qualification	1
is	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
WE	1
HAVE	1
seen	1
that	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
observations,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
foregoing	1
number	1
has	1
been	1
principally	1
devoted,	1
is,	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
natural	1
operation	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
interests	1
and	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
classes	1
of	1
the	1
community,	1
whether	1
the	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
be	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
numerous,	1
it	1
will	1
consist	1
almost	1
entirely	1
of	1
proprietors	1
of	1
land,	1
of	1
merchants,	1
and	1
of	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
learned	1
professions,	1
who	1
will	1
truly	1
represent	1
all	1
those	1
different	1
interests	1
and	1
views.	1
If	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
objected	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
other	1
descriptions	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
local	1
legislatures,	1
I	1
answer	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
admitted	1
there	1
are	1
exceptions	1
to	1
the	1
rule,	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
sufficient	1
number	1
to	1
influence	1
the	1
general	1
complexion	1
or	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
There	1
are	1
strong	1
minds	1
in	1
every	1
walk	1
of	1
life	1
that	1
will	1
rise	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
situation,	1
and	1
will	1
command	1
the	1
tribute	1
due	1
to	1
their	1
merit,	1
not	1
only	1
from	1
the	1
classes	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
particularly	1
belong,	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
society	1
in	1
general.	1
The	1
door	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
equally	1
open	1
to	1
all;	1
and	1
I	1
trust,	1
for	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
human	1
nature,	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
examples	1
of	1
such	1
vigorous	1
plants	1
flourishing	1
in	1
the	1
soil	1
of	1
federal	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
State	1
legislation;	1
but	1
occasional	1
instances	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
will	1
not	1
render	1
the	1
reasoning	1
founded	1
upon	1
the	1
general	1
course	1
of	1
things,	1
less	1
conclusive.	1
The	1
subject	1
might	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
several	1
other	1
lights	1
that	1
would	1
all	1
lead	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
result;	1
and	1
in	1
particular	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
asked,	1
What	1
greater	1
affinity	1
or	1
relation	1
of	1
interest	1
can	1
be	1
conceived	1
between	1
the	1
carpenter	1
and	1
blacksmith,	1
and	1
the	1
linen	1
manufacturer	1
or	1
stocking	1
weaver,	1
than	1
between	1
the	1
merchant	1
and	1
either	1
of	1
them?	1
It	1
is	1
notorious	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
often	1
as	1
great	1
rivalships	1
between	1
different	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
mechanic	1
or	1
manufacturing	1
arts	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
between	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
departments	1
of	1
labor	1
and	1
industry;	1
so	1
that,	1
unless	1
the	1
representative	1
body	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
far	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
would	1
be	1
consistent	1
with	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
regularity	1
or	1
wisdom	1
in	1
its	1
deliberations,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
what	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
objection	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
considering	1
should	1
ever	1
be	1
realized	1
in	1
practice.	1
But	1
I	1
forbear	1
to	1
dwell	1
any	1
longer	1
on	1
a	1
matter	1
which	1
has	1
hitherto	1
worn	1
too	1
loose	1
a	1
garb	1
to	1
admit	1
even	1
of	1
an	1
accurate	1
inspection	1
of	1
its	1
real	1
shape	1
or	1
tendency.	1
There	1
is	1
another	1
objection	1
of	1
a	1
somewhat	1
more	1
precise	1
nature	1
that	1
claims	1
our	1
attention.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
asserted	1
that	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
internal	1
taxation	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
exercised	1
with	1
advantage,	1
as	1
well	1
from	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
sufficient	1
knowledge	1
of	1
local	1
circumstances,	1
as	1
from	1
an	1
interference	1
between	1
the	1
revenue	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
States.	1
The	1
supposition	1
of	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
proper	1
knowledge	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
destitute	1
of	1
foundation.	1
If	1
any	1
question	1
is	1
depending	1
in	1
a	1
State	1
legislature	1
respecting	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
counties,	1
which	1
demands	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
local	1
details,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
acquired?	1
No	1
doubt	1
from	1
the	1
information	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
county.	1
Cannot	1
the	1
like	1
knowledge	1
be	1
obtained	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
from	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
each	1
State?	1
And	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
presumed	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
will	1
generally	1
be	1
sent	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
possessed	1
of	1
the	1
necessary	1
degree	1
of	1
intelligence	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
communicate	1
that	1
information?	1
Is	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
local	1
circumstances,	1
as	1
applied	1
to	1
taxation,	1
a	1
minute	1
topographical	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
mountains,	1
rivers,	1
streams,	1
highways,	1
and	1
bypaths	1
in	1
each	1
State;	1
or	1
is	1
it	1
a	1
general	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
its	1
situation	1
and	1
resources,	1
with	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
its	1
agriculture,	1
commerce,	1
manufactures,	1
with	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
its	1
products	1
and	1
consumptions,	1
with	1
the	1
different	1
degrees	1
and	1
kinds	1
of	1
its	1
wealth,	1
property,	1
and	1
industry?	1
Nations	1
in	1
general,	1
even	1
under	1
governments	1
of	1
the	1
more	1
popular	1
kind,	1
usually	1
commit	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
their	1
finances	1
to	1
single	1
men	1
or	1
to	1
boards	1
composed	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
individuals,	1
who	1
digest	1
and	1
prepare,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance,	1
the	1
plans	1
of	1
taxation,	1
which	1
are	1
afterwards	1
passed	1
into	1
laws	1
by	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
sovereign	1
or	1
legislature.	1
Inquisitive	1
and	1
enlightened	1
statesmen	1
are	1
deemed	1
everywhere	1
best	1
qualified	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
judicious	1
selection	1
of	1
the	1
objects	1
proper	1
for	1
revenue;	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
clear	1
indication,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
mankind	1
can	1
have	1
weight	1
in	1
the	1
question,	1
of	1
the	1
species	1
of	1
knowledge	1
of	1
local	1
circumstances	1
requisite	1
to	1
the	1
purposes	1
of	1
taxation.	1
The	1
taxes	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
comprised	1
under	1
the	1
general	1
denomination	1
of	1
internal	1
taxes	1
may	1
be	1
subdivided	1
into	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
DIRECT	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
INDIRECT	1
kind.	1
Though	1
the	1
objection	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
both,	1
yet	1
the	1
reasoning	1
upon	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
branch.	1
And	1
indeed,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
latter,	1
by	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
understood	1
duties	1
and	1
excises	1
on	1
articles	1
of	1
consumption,	1
one	1
is	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
conceive	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
difficulties	1
apprehended.	1
The	1
knowledge	1
relating	1
to	1
them	1
must	1
evidently	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
that	1
will	1
either	1
be	1
suggested	1
by	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
article	1
itself,	1
or	1
can	1
easily	1
be	1
procured	1
from	1
any	1
well-informed	1
man,	1
especially	1
of	1
the	1
mercantile	1
class.	1
The	1
circumstances	1
that	1
may	1
distinguish	1
its	1
situation	1
in	1
one	1
State	1
from	1
its	1
situation	1
in	1
another	1
must	1
be	1
few,	1
simple,	1
and	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
comprehended.	1
The	1
principal	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
attended	1
to,	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
avoid	1
those	1
articles	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
previously	1
appropriated	1
to	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
a	1
particular	1
State;	1
and	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
ascertaining	1
the	1
revenue	1
system	1
of	1
each.	1
This	1
could	1
always	1
be	1
known	1
from	1
the	1
respective	1
codes	1
of	1
laws,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
information	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
from	1
the	1
several	1
States.	1
The	1
objection,	1
when	1
applied	1
to	1
real	1
property	1
or	1
to	1
houses	1
and	1
lands,	1
appears	1
to	1
have,	1
at	1
first	1
sight,	1
more	1
foundation,	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
view	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
bear	1
a	1
close	1
examination.	1
Land	1
taxes	1
are	1
co	1
monly	1
laid	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
two	1
modes,	1
either	1
by	1
ACTUAL	1
valuations,	1
permanent	1
or	1
periodical,	1
or	1
by	1
OCCASIONAL	1
assessments,	1
at	1
the	1
discretion,	1
or	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
judgment,	1
of	1
certain	1
officers	1
whose	1
duty	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
make	1
them.	1
In	1
either	1
case,	1
the	1
EXECUTION	1
of	1
the	1
business,	1
which	1
alone	1
requires	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
local	1
details,	1
must	1
be	1
devolved	1
upon	1
discreet	1
persons	1
in	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
commissioners	1
or	1
assessors,	1
elected	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
or	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
government	1
for	1
the	1
purpose.	1
All	1
that	1
the	1
law	1
can	1
do	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
name	1
the	1
persons	1
or	1
to	1
prescribe	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
their	1
election	1
or	1
appointment,	1
to	1
fix	1
their	1
numbers	1
and	1
qualifications	1
and	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
general	1
outlines	1
of	1
their	1
powers	1
and	1
duties.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
that	1
cannot	1
as	1
well	1
be	1
performed	1
by	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
as	1
by	1
a	1
State	1
legislature?	1
The	1
attention	1
of	1
either	1
can	1
only	1
reach	1
to	1
general	1
principles;	1
local	1
details,	1
as	1
already	1
observed,	1
must	1
be	1
referred	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
plan.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
simple	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
in	1
which	1
this	1
matter	1
may	1
be	1
placed	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
altogether	1
satisfactory.	1
The	1
national	1
legislature	1
can	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
SYSTEM	1
OF	1
EACH	1
STATE	1
WITHIN	1
THAT	1
STATE.	1
The	1
method	1
of	1
laying	1
and	1
collecting	1
this	1
species	1
of	1
taxes	1
in	1
each	1
State	1
can,	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
parts,	1
be	1
adopted	1
and	1
employed	1
by	1
the	1
federal	1
government.	1
Let	1
it	1
be	1
recollected	1
that	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
these	1
taxes	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
legislature,	1
but	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
determined	1
by	1
the	1
numbers	1
of	1
each	1
State,	1
as	1
described	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
article.	1
An	1
actual	1
census	1
or	1
enumeration	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
must	1
furnish	1
the	1
rule,	1
a	1
circumstance	1
which	1
effectually	1
shuts	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
partiality	1
or	1
oppression.	1
The	1
abuse	1
of	1
this	1
power	1
of	1
taxation	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
provided	1
against	1
with	1
guarded	1
circumspection.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
precaution	1
just	1
mentioned,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
provision	1
that	1
"all	1
duties,	1
imposts,	1
and	1
excises	1
shall	1
be	1
UNIFORM	1
throughout	1
the	1
United	1
States."	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
properly	1
observed	1
by	1
different	1
speakers	1
and	1
writers	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
internal	1
taxation	1
by	1
the	1
Union	1
should	1
be	1
discovered	1
on	1
experiment	1
to	1
be	1
really	1
inconvenient,	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
may	1
then	1
forbear	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
requisitions	1
in	1
its	1
stead.	1
By	1
way	1
of	1
answer	1
to	1
this,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
triumphantly	1
asked,	1
Why	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance	1
omit	1
that	1
ambiguous	1
power,	1
and	1
rely	1
upon	1
the	1
latter	1
resource?	1
Two	1
solid	1
answers	1
may	1
be	1
given.	1
The	1
first	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
that	1
power,	1
if	1
convenient,	1
will	1
be	1
preferable,	1
because	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
effectual;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
prove	1
in	1
theory,	1
or	1
otherwise	1
than	1
by	1
the	1
experiment,	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
advantageously	1
exercised.	1
The	1
contrary,	1
indeed,	1
appears	1
most	1
probable.	1
The	1
second	1
answer	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
strong	1
influence	1
in	1
giving	1
efficacy	1
to	1
requisitions.	1
When	1
the	1
States	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Union	1
can	1
apply	1
itself	1
without	1
their	1
agency,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
powerful	1
motive	1
for	1
exertion	1
on	1
their	1
part.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
interference	1
of	1
the	1
revenue	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
of	1
its	1
members,	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
seen	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
clashing	1
or	1
repugnancy	1
of	1
authority.	1
The	1
laws	1
cannot,	1
therefore,	1
in	1
a	1
legal	1
sense,	1
interfere	1
with	1
each	1
other;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
impossible	1
to	1
avoid	1
an	1
interference	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
policy	1
of	1
their	1
different	1
systems.	1
An	1
effectual	1
expedient	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
will	1
be,	1
mutually,	1
to	1
abstain	1
from	1
those	1
objects	1
which	1
either	1
side	1
may	1
have	1
first	1
had	1
recourse	1
to.	1
As	1
neither	1
can	1
CONTROL	1
the	1
other,	1
each	1
will	1
have	1
an	1
obvious	1
and	1
sensible	1
interest	1
in	1
this	1
reciprocal	1
forbearance.	1
And	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
IMMEDIATE	1
common	1
interest,	1
we	1
may	1
safely	1
count	1
upon	1
its	1
operation.	1
When	1
the	1
particular	1
debts	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
are	1
done	1
away,	1
and	1
their	1
expenses	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
limited	1
within	1
their	1
natural	1
compass,	1
the	1
possibility	1
almost	1
of	1
interference	1
will	1
vanish.	1
A	1
small	1
land	1
tax	1
will	1
answer	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
their	1
most	1
simple	1
and	1
most	1
fit	1
resource.	1
Many	1
spectres	1
have	1
been	1
raised	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
power	1
of	1
internal	1
taxation,	1
to	1
excite	1
the	1
apprehensions	1
of	1
the	1
people:	1
double	1
sets	1
of	1
revenue	1
officers,	1
a	1
duplication	1
of	1
their	1
burdens	1
by	1
double	1
taxations,	1
and	1
the	1
frightful	1
forms	1
of	1
odious	1
and	1
oppressive	1
poll-taxes,	1
have	1
been	1
played	1
off	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
ingenious	1
dexterity	1
of	1
political	1
legerdemain.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
point,	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
cases	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
room	1
for	1
double	1
sets	1
of	1
officers:	1
one,	1
where	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
imposing	1
the	1
tax	1
is	1
exclusively	1
vested	1
in	1
the	1
Union,	1
which	1
applies	1
to	1
the	1
duties	1
on	1
imports;	1
the	1
other,	1
where	1
the	1
object	1
has	1
not	1
fallen	1
under	1
any	1
State	1
regulation	1
or	1
provision,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
applicable	1
to	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
objects.	1
In	1
other	1
cases,	1
the	1
probability	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
will	1
either	1
wholly	1
abstain	1
from	1
the	1
objects	1
preoccupied	1
for	1
local	1
purposes,	1
or	1
will	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
officers	1
and	1
State	1
regulations	1
for	1
collecting	1
the	1
additional	1
imposition.	1
This	1
will	1
best	1
answer	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
revenue,	1
because	1
it	1
will	1
save	1
expense	1
in	1
the	1
collection,	1
and	1
will	1
best	1
avoid	1
any	1
occasion	1
of	1
disgust	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
At	1
all	1
events,	1
here	1
is	1
a	1
practicable	1
expedient	1
for	1
avoiding	1
such	1
an	1
inconvenience;	1
and	1
nothing	1
more	1
can	1
be	1
required	1
than	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
evils	1
predicted	1
to	1
not	1
necessarily	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
plan.	1
As	1
to	1
any	1
argument	1
derived	1
from	1
a	1
supposed	1
system	1
of	1
influence,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sufficient	1
answer	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
presumed;	1
but	1
the	1
supposition	1
is	1
susceptible	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
precise	1
answer.	1
If	1
such	1
a	1
spirit	1
should	1
infest	1
the	1
councils	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
the	1
most	1
certain	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
its	1
aim	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
employ	1
the	1
State	1
officers	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible,	1
and	1
to	1
attach	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
Union	1
by	1
an	1
accumulation	1
of	1
their	1
emoluments.	1
This	1
would	1
serve	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
tide	1
of	1
State	1
influence	1
into	1
the	1
channels	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
instead	1
of	1
making	1
federal	1
influence	1
flow	1
in	1
an	1
opposite	1
and	1
adverse	1
current.	1
But	1
all	1
suppositions	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
are	1
invidious,	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
banished	1
from	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
question	1
before	1
the	1
people.	1
They	1
can	1
answer	1
no	1
other	1
end	1
than	1
to	1
cast	1
a	1
mist	1
over	1
the	1
truth.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
suggestion	1
of	1
double	1
taxation,	1
the	1
answer	1
is	1
plain.	1
The	1
wants	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
supplied	1
in	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another;	1
if	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
government.	1
The	1
quantity	1
of	1
taxes	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
by	1
the	1
community	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
either	1
case;	1
with	1
this	1
advantage,	1
if	1
the	1
provision	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
Union	1
that	1
the	1
capital	1
resource	1
of	1
commercial	1
imposts,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
convenient	1
branch	1
of	1
revenue,	1
can	1
be	1
prudently	1
improved	1
to	1
a	1
much	1
greater	1
extent	1
under	1
federal	1
than	1
under	1
State	1
regulation,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
will	1
render	1
it	1
less	1
necessary	1
to	1
recur	1
to	1
more	1
inconvenient	1
methods;	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
further	1
advantage,	1
that	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
any	1
real	1
difficulty	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
internal	1
taxation,	1
it	1
will	1
impose	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
greater	1
care	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
and	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
means;	1
and	1
must	1
naturally	1
tend	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
fixed	1
point	1
of	1
policy	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
administration	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
practicable	1
in	1
making	1
the	1
luxury	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
tributary	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
treasury,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
diminish	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
those	1
impositions	1
which	1
might	1
create	1
dissatisfaction	1
in	1
the	1
poorer	1
and	1
most	1
numerous	1
classes	1
of	1
the	1
society.	1
Happy	1
it	1
is	1
when	1
the	1
interest	1
which	1
the	1
government	1
has	1
in	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
power,	1
coincides	1
with	1
a	1
proper	1
distribution	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
burdens,	1
and	1
tends	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
least	1
wealthy	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
from	1
oppression!	1
As	1
to	1
poll	1
taxes,	1
I,	1
without	1
scruple,	1
confess	1
my	1
disapprobation	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
have	1
prevailed	1
from	1
an	1
early	1
period	1
in	1
those	1
States	1
[1]	1
which	1
have	1
uniformly	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
tenacious	1
of	1
their	1
rights,	1
I	1
should	1
lament	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
introduced	1
into	1
practice	1
under	1
the	1
national	1
government.	1
But	1
does	1
it	1
follow	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
power	1
to	1
lay	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
actually	1
be	1
laid?	1
Every	1
State	1
in	1
the	1
Union	1
has	1
power	1
to	1
impose	1
taxes	1
of	1
this	1
kind;	1
and	1
yet	1
in	1
several	1
of	1
them	1
they	1
are	1
unknown	1
in	1
practice.	1
Are	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
to	1
be	1
stigmatized	1
as	1
tyrannies,	1
because	1
they	1
possess	1
this	1
power?	1
If	1
they	1
are	1
not,	1
with	1
what	1
propriety	1
can	1
the	1
like	1
power	1
justify	1
such	1
a	1
charge	1
against	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
or	1
even	1
be	1
urged	1
as	1
an	1
obstacle	1
to	1
its	1
adoption?	1
As	1
little	1
friendly	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
the	1
species	1
of	1
imposition,	1
I	1
still	1
feel	1
a	1
thorough	1
conviction	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
having	1
recourse	1
to	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
exist	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
government.	1
There	1
are	1
certain	1
emergencies	1
of	1
nations,	1
in	1
which	1
expedients,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
forborne,	1
become	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
weal.	1
And	1
the	1
government,	1
from	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
such	1
emergencies,	1
ought	1
ever	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
option	1
of	1
making	1
use	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
real	1
scarcity	1
of	1
objects	1
in	1
this	1
country,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
productive	1
sources	1
of	1
revenue,	1
is	1
a	1
reason	1
peculiar	1
to	1
itself,	1
for	1
not	1
abridging	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
councils	1
in	1
this	1
respect.	1
There	1
may	1
exist	1
certain	1
critical	1
and	1
tempestuous	1
conjunctures	1
of	1
the	1
State,	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
poll	1
tax	1
may	1
become	1
an	1
inestimable	1
resource.	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
to	1
exempt	1
this	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
globe	1
from	1
the	1
common	1
calamities	1
that	1
have	1
befallen	1
other	1
parts	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
acknowledge	1
my	1
aversion	1
to	1
every	1
project	1
that	1
is	1
calculated	1
to	1
disarm	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
weapon,	1
which	1
in	1
any	1
possible	1
contingency	1
might	1
be	1
usefully	1
employed	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
defense	1
and	1
security.	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
gone	1
through	1
the	1
examination	1
of	1
such	1
of	1
the	1
powers	1
proposed	1
to	1
be	1
vested	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
having	1
an	1
immediate	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
government;	1
and	1
have	1
endeavored	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
principal	1
objections	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
them.	1
I	1
have	1
passed	1
over	1
in	1
silence	1
those	1
minor	1
authorities,	1
which	1
are	1
either	1
too	1
inconsiderable	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
thought	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
hostilities	1
of	1
the	1
opponents	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
or	1
of	1
too	1
manifest	1
propriety	1
to	1
admit	1
of	1
controversy.	1
The	1
mass	1
of	1
judiciary	1
power,	1
however,	1
might	1
have	1
claimed	1
an	1
investigation	1
under	1
this	1
head,	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
consideration	1
that	1
its	1
organization	1
and	1
its	1
extent	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
advantageously	1
considered	1
in	1
connection.	1
This	1
has	1
determined	1
me	1
to	1
refer	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
branch	1
of	1
our	1
inquiries	1
upon	1
which	1
we	1
shall	1
next	1
enter.	1

MADISON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
IN	1
REVIEWING	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
existing	1
Confederation,	1
and	1
showing	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
supplied	1
by	1
a	1
government	1
of	1
less	1
energy	1
than	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
public,	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
fell	1
of	1
course	1
under	1
consideration.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
ultimate	1
object	1
of	1
these	1
papers	1
is	1
to	1
determine	1
clearly	1
and	1
fully	1
the	1
merits	1
of	1
this	1
Constitution,	1
and	1
the	1
expediency	1
of	1
adopting	1
it,	1
our	1
plan	1
cannot	1
be	1
complete	1
without	1
taking	1
a	1
more	1
critical	1
and	1
thorough	1
survey	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
without	1
examining	1
it	1
on	1
all	1
its	1
sides,	1
comparing	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
parts,	1
and	1
calculating	1
its	1
probable	1
effects.	1
That	1
this	1
remaining	1
task	1
may	1
be	1
executed	1
under	1
impressions	1
conducive	1
to	1
a	1
just	1
and	1
fair	1
result,	1
some	1
reflections	1
must	1
in	1
this	1
place	1
be	1
indulged,	1
which	1
candor	1
previously	1
suggests.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
misfortune,	1
inseparable	1
from	1
human	1
affairs,	1
that	1
public	1
measures	1
are	1
rarely	1
investigated	1
with	1
that	1
spirit	1
of	1
moderation	1
which	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
a	1
just	1
estimate	1
of	1
their	1
real	1
tendency	1
to	1
advance	1
or	1
obstruct	1
the	1
public	1
good;	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
spirit	1
is	1
more	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
diminished	1
than	1
promoted,	1
by	1
those	1
occasions	1
which	1
require	1
an	1
unusual	1
exercise	1
of	1
it.	1
To	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
led	1
by	1
experience	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
this	1
consideration,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
appear	1
surprising,	1
that	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
which	1
recommends	1
so	1
many	1
important	1
changes	1
and	1
innovations,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
viewed	1
in	1
so	1
many	1
lights	1
and	1
relations,	1
and	1
which	1
touches	1
the	1
springs	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
passions	1
and	1
interests,	1
should	1
find	1
or	1
excite	1
dispositions	1
unfriendly,	1
both	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
to	1
a	1
fair	1
discussion	1
and	1
accurate	1
judgment	1
of	1
its	1
merits.	1
In	1
some,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
too	1
evident	1
from	1
their	1
own	1
publications,	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
scanned	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
not	1
only	1
with	1
a	1
predisposition	1
to	1
censure,	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
predetermination	1
to	1
condemn;	1
as	1
the	1
language	1
held	1
by	1
others	1
betrays	1
an	1
opposite	1
predetermination	1
or	1
bias,	1
which	1
must	1
render	1
their	1
opinions	1
also	1
of	1
little	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
question.	1
In	1
placing,	1
however,	1
these	1
different	1
characters	1
on	1
a	1
level,	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
their	1
opinions,	1
I	1
wish	1
not	1
to	1
insinuate	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
material	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
purity	1
of	1
their	1
intentions.	1
It	1
is	1
but	1
just	1
to	1
remark	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
description,	1
that	1
as	1
our	1
situation	1
is	1
universally	1
admitted	1
to	1
be	1
peculiarly	1
critical,	1
and	1
to	1
require	1
indispensably	1
that	1
something	1
should	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
our	1
relief,	1
the	1
predetermined	1
patron	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
actually	1
done	1
may	1
have	1
taken	1
his	1
bias	1
from	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
these	1
considerations,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
from	1
considerations	1
of	1
a	1
sinister	1
nature.	1
The	1
predetermined	1
adversary,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
can	1
have	1
been	1
governed	1
by	1
no	1
venial	1
motive	1
whatever.	1
The	1
intentions	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
may	1
be	1
upright,	1
as	1
they	1
may	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
be	1
culpable.	1
The	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
cannot	1
be	1
upright,	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
culpable.	1
But	1
the	1
truth	1
is,	1
that	1
these	1
papers	1
are	1
not	1
addressed	1
to	1
persons	1
falling	1
under	1
either	1
of	1
these	1
characters.	1
They	1
solicit	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
those	1
only,	1
who	1
add	1
to	1
a	1
sincere	1
zeal	1
for	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
their	1
country,	1
a	1
temper	1
favorable	1
to	1
a	1
just	1
estimate	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
promoting	1
it.	1
Persons	1
of	1
this	1
character	1
will	1
proceed	1
to	1
an	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
submitted	1
by	1
the	1
convention,	1
not	1
only	1
without	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
find	1
or	1
to	1
magnify	1
faults;	1
but	1
will	1
see	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
reflecting,	1
that	1
a	1
faultless	1
plan	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
expected.	1
Nor	1
will	1
they	1
barely	1
make	1
allowances	1
for	1
the	1
errors	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
chargeable	1
on	1
the	1
fallibility	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
convention,	1
as	1
a	1
body	1
of	1
men,	1
were	1
liable;	1
but	1
will	1
keep	1
in	1
mind,	1
that	1
they	1
themselves	1
also	1
are	1
but	1
men,	1
and	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
assume	1
an	1
infallibility	1
in	1
rejudging	1
the	1
fallible	1
opinions	1
of	1
others.	1
With	1
equal	1
readiness	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
perceived,	1
that	1
besides	1
these	1
inducements	1
to	1
candor,	1
many	1
allowances	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
difficulties	1
inherent	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
undertaking	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
convention.	1
The	1
novelty	1
of	1
the	1
undertaking	1
immediately	1
strikes	1
us.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
shown	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
papers,	1
that	1
the	1
existing	1
Confederation	1
is	1
founded	1
on	1
principles	1
which	1
are	1
fallacious;	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
consequently	1
change	1
this	1
first	1
foundation,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
superstructure	1
resting	1
upon	1
it.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
shown,	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
confederacies	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
consulted	1
as	1
precedents	1
have	1
been	1
vitiated	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
erroneous	1
principles,	1
and	1
can	1
therefore	1
furnish	1
no	1
other	1
light	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
beacons,	1
which	1
give	1
warning	1
of	1
the	1
course	1
to	1
be	1
shunned,	1
without	1
pointing	1
out	1
that	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
pursued.	1
The	1
most	1
that	1
the	1
convention	1
could	1
do	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
situation,	1
was	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
errors	1
suggested	1
by	1
the	1
past	1
experience	1
of	1
other	1
countries,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
our	1
own;	1
and	1
to	1
provide	1
a	1
convenient	1
mode	1
of	1
rectifying	1
their	1
own	1
errors,	1
as	1
future	1
experiences	1
may	1
unfold	1
them.	1
Among	1
the	1
difficulties	1
encountered	1
by	1
the	1
convention,	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
one	1
must	1
have	1
lain	1
in	1
combining	1
the	1
requisite	1
stability	1
and	1
energy	1
in	1
government,	1
with	1
the	1
inviolable	1
attention	1
due	1
to	1
liberty	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
republican	1
form.	1
Without	1
substantially	1
accomplishing	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
undertaking,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
very	1
imperfectly	1
fulfilled	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
their	1
appointment,	1
or	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
public;	1
yet	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
easily	1
accomplished,	1
will	1
be	1
denied	1
by	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
unwilling	1
to	1
betray	1
his	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
subject.	1
Energy	1
in	1
government	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
that	1
security	1
against	1
external	1
and	1
internal	1
danger,	1
and	1
to	1
that	1
prompt	1
and	1
salutary	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
which	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
very	1
definition	1
of	1
good	1
government.	1
Stability	1
in	1
government	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
national	1
character	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
advantages	1
annexed	1
to	1
it,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
that	1
repose	1
and	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
which	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
chief	1
blessings	1
of	1
civil	1
society.	1
An	1
irregular	1
and	1
mutable	1
legislation	1
is	1
not	1
more	1
an	1
evil	1
in	1
itself	1
than	1
it	1
is	1
odious	1
to	1
the	1
people;	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
pronounced	1
with	1
assurance	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
this	1
country,	1
enlightened	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
nature,	1
and	1
interested,	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
them	1
are,	1
in	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
good	1
government,	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
satisfied	1
till	1
some	1
remedy	1
be	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
vicissitudes	1
and	1
uncertainties	1
which	1
characterize	1
the	1
State	1
administrations.	1
On	1
comparing,	1
however,	1
these	1
valuable	1
ingredients	1
with	1
the	1
vital	1
principles	1
of	1
liberty,	1
we	1
must	1
perceive	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
mingling	1
them	1
together	1
in	1
their	1
due	1
proportions.	1
The	1
genius	1
of	1
republican	1
liberty	1
seems	1
to	1
demand	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
all	1
power	1
should	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
but	1
that	1
those	1
intrusted	1
with	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
independence	1
on	1
the	1
people,	1
by	1
a	1
short	1
duration	1
of	1
their	1
appointments;	1
and	1
that	1
even	1
during	1
this	1
short	1
period	1
the	1
trust	1
should	1
be	1
placed	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
few,	1
but	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
hands.	1
Stability,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
requires	1
that	1
the	1
hands	1
in	1
which	1
power	1
is	1
lodged	1
should	1
continue	1
for	1
a	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
the	1
same.	1
A	1
frequent	1
change	1
of	1
men	1
will	1
result	1
from	1
a	1
frequent	1
return	1
of	1
elections;	1
and	1
a	1
frequent	1
change	1
of	1
measures	1
from	1
a	1
frequent	1
change	1
of	1
men:	1
whilst	1
energy	1
in	1
government	1
requires	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
certain	1
duration	1
of	1
power,	1
but	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
hand.	1
How	1
far	1
the	1
convention	1
may	1
have	1
succeeded	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
work,	1
will	1
better	1
appear	1
on	1
a	1
more	1
accurate	1
view	1
of	1
it.	1
From	1
the	1
cursory	1
view	1
here	1
taken,	1
it	1
must	1
clearly	1
appear	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
arduous	1
part.	1
Not	1
less	1
arduous	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
marking	1
the	1
proper	1
line	1
of	1
partition	1
between	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments.	1
Every	1
man	1
will	1
be	1
sensible	1
of	1
this	1
difficulty,	1
in	1
proportion	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
contemplate	1
and	1
discriminate	1
objects	1
extensive	1
and	1
complicated	1
in	1
their	1
nature.	1
The	1
faculties	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
itself	1
have	1
never	1
yet	1
been	1
distinguished	1
and	1
defined,	1
with	1
satisfactory	1
precision,	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
acute	1
and	1
metaphysical	1
philosophers.	1
Sense,	1
perception,	1
judgment,	1
desire,	1
volition,	1
memory,	1
imagination,	1
are	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
separated	1
by	1
such	1
delicate	1
shades	1
and	1
minute	1
gradations	1
that	1
their	1
boundaries	1
have	1
eluded	1
the	1
most	1
subtle	1
investigations,	1
and	1
remain	1
a	1
pregnant	1
source	1
of	1
ingenious	1
disquisition	1
and	1
controversy.	1
The	1
boundaries	1
between	1
the	1
great	1
kingdom	1
of	1
nature,	1
and,	1
still	1
more,	1
between	1
the	1
various	1
provinces,	1
and	1
lesser	1
portions,	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
subdivided,	1
afford	1
another	1
illustration	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
important	1
truth.	1
The	1
most	1
sagacious	1
and	1
laborious	1
naturalists	1
have	1
never	1
yet	1
succeeded	1
in	1
tracing	1
with	1
certainty	1
the	1
line	1
which	1
separates	1
the	1
district	1
of	1
vegetable	1
life	1
from	1
the	1
neighboring	1
region	1
of	1
unorganized	1
matter,	1
or	1
which	1
marks	1
the	1
termination	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
and	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
animal	1
empire.	1
A	1
still	1
greater	1
obscurity	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
distinctive	1
characters	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
objects	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
great	1
departments	1
of	1
nature	1
have	1
been	1
arranged	1
and	1
assorted.	1
When	1
we	1
pass	1
from	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
nature,	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
delineations	1
are	1
perfectly	1
accurate,	1
and	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
otherwise	1
only	1
from	1
the	1
imperfection	1
of	1
the	1
eye	1
which	1
surveys	1
them,	1
to	1
the	1
institutions	1
of	1
man,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
obscurity	1
arises	1
as	1
well	1
from	1
the	1
object	1
itself	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
organ	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
contemplated,	1
we	1
must	1
perceive	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
moderating	1
still	1
further	1
our	1
expectations	1
and	1
hopes	1
from	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
human	1
sagacity.	1
Experience	1
has	1
instructed	1
us	1
that	1
no	1
skill	1
in	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
government	1
has	1
yet	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
discriminate	1
and	1
define,	1
with	1
sufficient	1
certainty,	1
its	1
three	1
great	1
provinces	1
the	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judiciary;	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
privileges	1
and	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
legislative	1
branches.	1
Questions	1
daily	1
occur	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
practice,	1
which	1
prove	1
the	1
obscurity	1
which	1
reins	1
in	1
these	1
subjects,	1
and	1
which	1
puzzle	1
the	1
greatest	1
adepts	1
in	1
political	1
science.	1
The	1
experience	1
of	1
ages,	1
with	1
the	1
continued	1
and	1
combined	1
labors	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
enlightened	1
legislatures	1
and	1
jurists,	1
has	1
been	1
equally	1
unsuccessful	1
in	1
delineating	1
the	1
several	1
objects	1
and	1
limits	1
of	1
different	1
codes	1
of	1
laws	1
and	1
different	1
tribunals	1
of	1
justice.	1
The	1
precise	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
statute	1
law,	1
the	1
maritime	1
law,	1
the	1
ecclesiastical	1
law,	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
corporations,	1
and	1
other	1
local	1
laws	1
and	1
customs,	1
remains	1
still	1
to	1
be	1
clearly	1
and	1
finally	1
established	1
in	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
where	1
accuracy	1
in	1
such	1
subjects	1
has	1
been	1
more	1
industriously	1
pursued	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
The	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
her	1
several	1
courts,	1
general	1
and	1
local,	1
of	1
law,	1
of	1
equity,	1
of	1
admiralty,	1
etc.,	1
is	1
not	1
less	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
frequent	1
and	1
intricate	1
discussions,	1
sufficiently	1
denoting	1
the	1
indeterminate	1
limits	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
respectively	1
circumscribed.	1
All	1
new	1
laws,	1
though	1
penned	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
technical	1
skill,	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
the	1
fullest	1
and	1
most	1
mature	1
deliberation,	1
are	1
considered	1
as	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
obscure	1
and	1
equivocal,	1
until	1
their	1
meaning	1
be	1
liquidated	1
and	1
ascertained	1
by	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
particular	1
discussions	1
and	1
adjudications.	1
Besides	1
the	1
obscurity	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
complexity	1
of	1
objects,	1
and	1
the	1
imperfection	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
faculties,	1
the	1
medium	1
through	1
which	1
the	1
conceptions	1
of	1
men	1
are	1
conveyed	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
adds	1
a	1
fresh	1
embarrassment.	1
The	1
use	1
of	1
words	1
is	1
to	1
express	1
ideas.	1
Perspicuity,	1
therefore,	1
requires	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
the	1
ideas	1
should	1
be	1
distinctly	1
formed,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
expressed	1
by	1
words	1
distinctly	1
and	1
exclusively	1
appropriate	1
to	1
them.	1
But	1
no	1
language	1
is	1
so	1
copious	1
as	1
to	1
supply	1
words	1
and	1
phrases	1
for	1
every	1
complex	1
idea,	1
or	1
so	1
correct	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
include	1
many	1
equivocally	1
denoting	1
different	1
ideas.	1
Hence	1
it	1
must	1
happen	1
that	1
however	1
accurately	1
objects	1
may	1
be	1
discriminated	1
in	1
themselves,	1
and	1
however	1
accurately	1
the	1
discrimination	1
may	1
be	1
considered,	1
the	1
definition	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
be	1
rendered	1
inaccurate	1
by	1
the	1
inaccuracy	1
of	1
the	1
terms	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
delivered.	1
And	1
this	1
unavoidable	1
inaccuracy	1
must	1
be	1
greater	1
or	1
less,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
complexity	1
and	1
novelty	1
of	1
the	1
objects	1
defined.	1
When	1
the	1
Almighty	1
himself	1
condescends	1
to	1
address	1
mankind	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
language,	1
his	1
meaning,	1
luminous	1
as	1
it	1
must	1
be,	1
is	1
rendered	1
dim	1
and	1
doubtful	1
by	1
the	1
cloudy	1
medium	1
through	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
communicated.	1
Here,	1
then,	1
are	1
three	1
sources	1
of	1
vague	1
and	1
incorrect	1
definitions:	1
indistinctness	1
of	1
the	1
object,	1
imperfection	1
of	1
the	1
organ	1
of	1
conception,	1
inadequateness	1
of	1
the	1
vehicle	1
of	1
ideas.	1
Any	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
must	1
produce	1
a	1
certain	1
degree	1
of	1
obscurity.	1
The	1
convention,	1
in	1
delineating	1
the	1
boundary	1
between	1
the	1
federal	1
and	1
State	1
jurisdictions,	1
must	1
have	1
experienced	1
the	1
full	1
effect	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
To	1
the	1
difficulties	1
already	1
mentioned	1
may	1
be	1
added	1
the	1
interfering	1
pretensions	1
of	1
the	1
larger	1
and	1
smaller	1
States.	1
We	1
cannot	1
err	1
in	1
supposing	1
that	1
the	1
former	1
would	1
contend	1
for	1
a	1
participation	1
in	1
the	1
government,	1
fully	1
proportioned	1
to	1
their	1
superior	1
wealth	1
and	1
importance;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
less	1
tenacious	1
of	1
the	1
equality	1
at	1
present	1
enjoyed	1
by	1
them.	1
We	1
may	1
well	1
suppose	1
that	1
neither	1
side	1
would	1
entirely	1
yield	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
consequently	1
that	1
the	1
struggle	1
could	1
be	1
terminated	1
only	1
by	1
compromise.	1
It	1
is	1
extremely	1
probable,	1
also,	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
ratio	1
of	1
representation	1
had	1
been	1
adjusted,	1
this	1
very	1
compromise	1
must	1
have	1
produced	1
a	1
fresh	1
struggle	1
between	1
the	1
same	1
parties,	1
to	1
give	1
such	1
a	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
organization	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
distribution	1
of	1
its	1
powers,	1
as	1
would	1
increase	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
branches,	1
in	1
forming	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
respectively	1
obtained	1
the	1
greatest	1
share	1
of	1
influence.	1
There	1
are	1
features	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution	1
which	1
warrant	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
suppositions;	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
well	1
founded,	1
it	1
shows	1
that	1
the	1
convention	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
compelled	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
theoretical	1
propriety	1
to	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
extraneous	1
considerations.	1
Nor	1
could	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
large	1
and	1
small	1
States	1
only,	1
which	1
would	1
marshal	1
themselves	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
on	1
various	1
points.	1
Other	1
combinations,	1
resulting	1
from	1
a	1
difference	1
of	1
local	1
position	1
and	1
policy,	1
must	1
have	1
created	1
additional	1
difficulties.	1
As	1
every	1
State	1
may	1
be	1
divided	1
into	1
different	1
districts,	1
and	1
its	1
citizens	1
into	1
different	1
classes,	1
which	1
give	1
birth	1
to	1
contending	1
interests	1
and	1
local	1
jealousies,	1
so	1
the	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
are	1
distinguished	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
by	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
circumstances,	1
which	1
produce	1
a	1
like	1
effect	1
on	1
a	1
larger	1
scale.	1
And	1
although	1
this	1
variety	1
of	1
interests,	1
for	1
reasons	1
sufficiently	1
explained	1
in	1
a	1
former	1
paper,	1
may	1
have	1
a	1
salutary	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
when	1
formed,	1
yet	1
every	1
one	1
must	1
be	1
sensible	1
of	1
the	1
contrary	1
influence,	1
which	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
experienced	1
in	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
forming	1
it.	1
Would	1
it	1
be	1
wonderful	1
if,	1
under	1
the	1
pressure	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
difficulties,	1
the	1
convention	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
forced	1
into	1
some	1
deviations	1
from	1
that	1
artificial	1
structure	1
and	1
regular	1
symmetry	1
which	1
an	1
abstract	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
might	1
lead	1
an	1
ingenious	1
theorist	1
to	1
bestow	1
on	1
a	1
Constitution	1
planned	1
in	1
his	1
closet	1
or	1
in	1
his	1
imagination?	1
The	1
real	1
wonder	1
is	1
that	1
so	1
many	1
difficulties	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
surmounted,	1
and	1
surmounted	1
with	1
a	1
unanimity	1
almost	1
as	1
unprecedented	1
as	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
unexpected.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
any	1
man	1
of	1
candor	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
this	1
circumstance	1
without	1
partaking	1
of	1
the	1
astonishment.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
pious	1
reflection	1
not	1
to	1
perceive	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
finger	1
of	1
that	1
Almighty	1
hand	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
frequently	1
and	1
signally	1
extended	1
to	1
our	1
relief	1
in	1
the	1
critical	1
stages	1
of	1
the	1
revolution.	1
We	1
had	1
occasion,	1
in	1
a	1
former	1
paper,	1
to	1
take	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
repeated	1
trials	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
unsuccessfully	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
Netherlands	1
for	1
reforming	1
the	1
baneful	1
and	1
notorious	1
vices	1
of	1
their	1
constitution.	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
great	1
councils	1
and	1
consultations	1
held	1
among	1
mankind	1
for	1
reconciling	1
their	1
discordant	1
opinions,	1
assuaging	1
their	1
mutual	1
jealousies,	1
and	1
adjusting	1
their	1
respective	1
interests,	1
is	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
factions,	1
contentions,	1
and	1
disappointments,	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
classed	1
among	1
the	1
most	1
dark	1
and	1
degraded	1
pictures	1
which	1
display	1
the	1
infirmities	1
and	1
depravities	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
character.	1
If,	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
scattered	1
instances,	1
a	1
brighter	1
aspect	1
is	1
presented,	1
they	1
serve	1
only	1
as	1
exceptions	1
to	1
admonish	1
us	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
truth;	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
lustre	1
to	1
darken	1
the	1
gloom	1
of	1
the	1
adverse	1
prospect	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
contrasted.	1
In	1
revolving	1
the	1
causes	1
from	1
which	1
these	1
exceptions	1
result,	1
and	1
applying	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
particular	1
instances	1
before	1
us,	1
we	1
are	1
necessarily	1
led	1
to	1
two	1
important	1
conclusions.	1
The	1
first	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
convention	1
must	1
have	1
enjoyed,	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
singular	1
degree,	1
an	1
exemption	1
from	1
the	1
pestilential	1
influence	1
of	1
party	1
animosities	1
the	1
disease	1
most	1
incident	1
to	1
deliberative	1
bodies,	1
and	1
most	1
apt	1
to	1
contaminate	1
their	1
proceedings.	1
The	1
second	1
conclusion	1
is	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
deputations	1
composing	1
the	1
convention	1
were	1
satisfactorily	1
accommodated	1
by	1
the	1
final	1
act,	1
or	1
were	1
induced	1
to	1
accede	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
a	1
deep	1
conviction	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
sacrificing	1
private	1
opinions	1
and	1
partial	1
interests	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
good,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
despair	1
of	1
seeing	1
this	1
necessity	1
diminished	1
by	1
delays	1
or	1
by	1
new	1
experiments.	1

To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
IT	1
IS	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
remarkable	1
that	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
reported	1
by	1
ancient	1
history,	1
in	1
which	1
government	1
has	1
been	1
established	1
with	1
deliberation	1
and	1
consent,	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
framing	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
committed	1
to	1
an	1
assembly	1
of	1
men,	1
but	1
has	1
been	1
performed	1
by	1
some	1
individual	1
citizen	1
of	1
preeminent	1
wisdom	1
and	1
approved	1
integrity.	1
Minos,	1
we	1
learn,	1
was	1
the	1
primitive	1
founder	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
Crete,	1
as	1
Zaleucus	1
was	1
of	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Locrians.	1
Theseus	1
first,	1
and	1
after	1
him	1
Draco	1
and	1
Solon,	1
instituted	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
Athens.	1
Lycurgus	1
was	1
the	1
lawgiver	1
of	1
Sparta.	1
The	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
government	1
of	1
Rome	1
was	1
laid	1
by	1
Romulus,	1
and	1
the	1
work	1
completed	1
by	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
elective	1
successors,	1
Numa	1
and	1
Tullius	1
Hostilius.	1
On	1
the	1
abolition	1
of	1
royalty	1
the	1
consular	1
administration	1
was	1
substituted	1
by	1
Brutus,	1
who	1
stepped	1
forward	1
with	1
a	1
project	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
reform,	1
which,	1
he	1
alleged,	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
by	1
Tullius	1
Hostilius,	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
address	1
obtained	1
the	1
assent	1
and	1
ratification	1
of	1
the	1
senate	1
and	1
people.	1
This	1
remark	1
is	1
applicable	1
to	1
confederate	1
governments	1
also.	1
Amphictyon,	1
we	1
are	1
told,	1
was	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
bore	1
his	1
name.	1
The	1
Achaean	1
league	1
received	1
its	1
first	1
birth	1
from	1
Achaeus,	1
and	1
its	1
second	1
from	1
Aratus.	1
What	1
degree	1
of	1
agency	1
these	1
reputed	1
lawgivers	1
might	1
have	1
in	1
their	1
respective	1
establishments,	1
or	1
how	1
far	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
the	1
legitimate	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
cannot	1
in	1
every	1
instance	1
be	1
ascertained.	1
In	1
some,	1
however,	1
the	1
proceeding	1
was	1
strictly	1
regular.	1
Draco	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
intrusted	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Athens	1
with	1
indefinite	1
powers	1
to	1
reform	1
its	1
government	1
and	1
laws.	1
And	1
Solon,	1
according	1
to	1
Plutarch,	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
compelled,	1
by	1
the	1
universal	1
suffrage	1
of	1
his	1
fellow-citizens,	1
to	1
take	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
sole	1
and	1
absolute	1
power	1
of	1
new-modeling	1
the	1
constitution.	1
The	1
proceedings	1
under	1
Lycurgus	1
were	1
less	1
regular;	1
but	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
advocates	1
for	1
a	1
regular	1
reform	1
could	1
prevail,	1
they	1
all	1
turned	1
their	1
eyes	1
towards	1
the	1
single	1
efforts	1
of	1
that	1
celebrated	1
patriot	1
and	1
sage,	1
instead	1
of	1
seeking	1
to	1
bring	1
about	1
a	1
revolution	1
by	1
the	1
intervention	1
of	1
a	1
deliberative	1
body	1
of	1
citizens.	1
Whence	1
could	1
it	1
have	1
proceeded,	1
that	1
a	1
people,	1
jealous	1
as	1
the	1
Greeks	1
were	1
of	1
their	1
liberty,	1
should	1
so	1
far	1
abandon	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
caution	1
as	1
to	1
place	1
their	1
destiny	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
citizen?	1
Whence	1
could	1
it	1
have	1
proceeded,	1
that	1
the	1
Athenians,	1
a	1
people	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
an	1
army	1
to	1
be	1
commanded	1
by	1
fewer	1
than	1
ten	1
generals,	1
and	1
who	1
required	1
no	1
other	1
proof	1
of	1
danger	1
to	1
their	1
liberties	1
than	1
the	1
illustrious	1
merit	1
of	1
a	1
fellow-citizen,	1
should	1
consider	1
one	1
illustrious	1
citizen	1
as	1
a	1
more	1
eligible	1
depositary	1
of	1
the	1
fortunes	1
of	1
themselves	1
and	1
their	1
posterity,	1
than	1
a	1
select	1
body	1
of	1
citizens,	1
from	1
whose	1
common	1
deliberations	1
more	1
wisdom,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
more	1
safety,	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
expected?	1
These	1
questions	1
cannot	1
be	1
fully	1
answered,	1
without	1
supposing	1
that	1
the	1
fears	1
of	1
discord	1
and	1
disunion	1
among	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
counsellors	1
exceeded	1
the	1
apprehension	1
of	1
treachery	1
or	1
incapacity	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
individual.	1
History	1
informs	1
us,	1
likewise,	1
of	1
the	1
difficulties	1
with	1
which	1
these	1
celebrated	1
reformers	1
had	1
to	1
contend,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
expedients	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
employ	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
carry	1
their	1
reforms	1
into	1
effect.	1
Solon,	1
who	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
indulged	1
a	1
more	1
temporizing	1
policy,	1
confessed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
given	1
to	1
his	1
countrymen	1
the	1
government	1
best	1
suited	1
to	1
their	1
happiness,	1
but	1
most	1
tolerable	1
to	1
their	1
prejudices.	1
And	1
Lycurgus,	1
more	1
true	1
to	1
his	1
object,	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
mixing	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
violence	1
with	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
superstition,	1
and	1
of	1
securing	1
his	1
final	1
success	1
by	1
a	1
voluntary	1
renunciation,	1
first	1
of	1
his	1
country,	1
and	1
then	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
If	1
these	1
lessons	1
teach	1
us,	1
on	1
one	1
hand,	1
to	1
admire	1
the	1
improvement	1
made	1
by	1
America	1
on	1
the	1
ancient	1
mode	1
of	1
preparing	1
and	1
establishing	1
regular	1
plans	1
of	1
government,	1
they	1
serve	1
not	1
less,	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
to	1
admonish	1
us	1
of	1
the	1
hazards	1
and	1
difficulties	1
incident	1
to	1
such	1
experiments,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
imprudence	1
of	1
unnecessarily	1
multiplying	1
them.	1
Is	1
it	1
an	1
unreasonable	1
conjecture,	1
that	1
the	1
errors	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
are	1
such	1
as	1
have	1
resulted	1
rather	1
from	1
the	1
defect	1
of	1
antecedent	1
experience	1
on	1
this	1
complicated	1
and	1
difficult	1
subject,	1
than	1
from	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
accuracy	1
or	1
care	1
in	1
the	1
investigation	1
of	1
it;	1
and,	1
consequently	1
such	1
as	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
ascertained	1
until	1
an	1
actual	1
trial	1
shall	1
have	1
pointed	1
them	1
out?	1
This	1
conjecture	1
is	1
rendered	1
probable,	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
many	1
considerations	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
nature,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
particular	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
Articles	1
of	1
Confederation.	1
It	1
is	1
observable	1
that	1
among	1
the	1
numerous	1
objections	1
and	1
amendments	1
suggested	1
by	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
when	1
these	1
articles	1
were	1
submitted	1
for	1
their	1
ratification,	1
not	1
one	1
is	1
found	1
which	1
alludes	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
radical	1
error	1
which	1
on	1
actual	1
trial	1
has	1
discovered	1
itself.	1
And	1
if	1
we	1
except	1
the	1
observations	1
which	1
New	1
Jersey	1
was	1
led	1
to	1
make,	1
rather	1
by	1
her	1
local	1
situation,	1
than	1
by	1
her	1
peculiar	1
foresight,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
questioned	1
whether	1
a	1
single	1
suggestion	1
was	1
of	1
sufficient	1
moment	1
to	1
justify	1
a	1
revision	1
of	1
the	1
system.	1
There	1
is	1
abundant	1
reason,	1
nevertheless,	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
immaterial	1
as	1
these	1
objections	1
were,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
adhered	1
to	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
dangerous	1
inflexibility,	1
in	1
some	1
States,	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
zeal	1
for	1
their	1
opinions	1
and	1
supposed	1
interests	1
been	1
stifled	1
by	1
the	1
more	1
powerful	1
sentiment	1
of	1
selfpreservation.	1
One	1
State,	1
we	1
may	1
remember,	1
persisted	1
for	1
several	1
years	1
in	1
refusing	1
her	1
concurrence,	1
although	1
the	1
enemy	1
remained	1
the	1
whole	1
period	1
at	1
our	1
gates,	1
or	1
rather	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
bowels	1
of	1
our	1
country.	1
Nor	1
was	1
her	1
pliancy	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
effected	1
by	1
a	1
less	1
motive,	1
than	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
being	1
chargeable	1
with	1
protracting	1
the	1
public	1
calamities,	1
and	1
endangering	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
the	1
contest.	1
Every	1
candid	1
reader	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
proper	1
reflections	1
on	1
these	1
important	1
facts.	1
A	1
patient	1
who	1
finds	1
his	1
disorder	1
daily	1
growing	1
worse,	1
and	1
that	1
an	1
efficacious	1
remedy	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
delayed	1
without	1
extreme	1
danger,	1
after	1
coolly	1
revolving	1
his	1
situation,	1
and	1
the	1
characters	1
of	1
different	1
physicians,	1
selects	1
and	1
calls	1
in	1
such	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
judges	1
most	1
capable	1
of	1
administering	1
relief,	1
and	1
best	1
entitled	1
to	1
his	1
confidence.	1
The	1
physicians	1
attend;	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
patient	1
is	1
carefully	1
examined;	1
a	1
consultation	1
is	1
held;	1
they	1
are	1
unanimously	1
agreed	1
that	1
the	1
symptoms	1
are	1
critical,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
case,	1
with	1
proper	1
and	1
timely	1
relief,	1
is	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
desperate,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
issue	1
in	1
an	1
improvement	1
of	1
his	1
constitution.	1
They	1
are	1
equally	1
unanimous	1
in	1
prescribing	1
the	1
remedy,	1
by	1
which	1
this	1
happy	1
effect	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
produced.	1
The	1
prescription	1
is	1
no	1
sooner	1
made	1
known,	1
however,	1
than	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
persons	1
interpose,	1
and,	1
without	1
denying	1
the	1
reality	1
or	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
disorder,	1
assure	1
the	1
patient	1
that	1
the	1
prescription	1
will	1
be	1
poison	1
to	1
his	1
constitution,	1
and	1
forbid	1
him,	1
under	1
pain	1
of	1
certain	1
death,	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
it.	1
Might	1
not	1
the	1
patient	1
reasonably	1
demand,	1
before	1
he	1
ventured	1
to	1
follow	1
this	1
advice,	1
that	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
it	1
should	1
at	1
least	1
agree	1
among	1
themselves	1
on	1
some	1
other	1
remedy	1
to	1
be	1
substituted?	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
differing	1
as	1
much	1
from	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
from	1
his	1
first	1
counsellors,	1
would	1
he	1
not	1
act	1
prudently	1
in	1
trying	1
the	1
experiment	1
unanimously	1
recommended	1
by	1
the	1
latter,	1
rather	1
than	1
be	1
hearkening	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
could	1
neither	1
deny	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
speedy	1
remedy,	1
nor	1
agree	1
in	1
proposing	1
one?	1
Such	1
a	1
patient	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
situation	1
is	1
America	1
at	1
this	1
moment.	1
She	1
has	1
been	1
sensible	1
of	1
her	1
malady.	1
She	1
has	1
obtained	1
a	1
regular	1
and	1
unanimous	1
advice	1
from	1
men	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
deliberate	1
choice.	1
And	1
she	1
is	1
warned	1
by	1
others	1
against	1
following	1
this	1
advice	1
under	1
pain	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
fatal	1
consequences.	1
Do	1
the	1
monitors	1
deny	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
her	1
danger?	1
No.	1
Do	1
they	1
deny	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
some	1
speedy	1
and	1
powerful	1
remedy?	1
No.	1
Are	1
they	1
agreed,	1
are	1
any	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
agreed,	1
in	1
their	1
objections	1
to	1
the	1
remedy	1
proposed,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
proper	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
substituted?	1
Let	1
them	1
speak	1
for	1
themselves.	1
This	1
one	1
tells	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
rejected,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
confederation	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
but	1
a	1
government	1
over	1
individuals.	1
Another	1
admits	1
that	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
government	1
over	1
individuals	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
extent,	1
but	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
proposed.	1
A	1
third	1
does	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
over	1
individuals,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
proposed,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
rights.	1
A	1
fourth	1
concurs	1
in	1
the	1
absolute	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
rights,	1
but	1
contends	1
that	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
declaratory,	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
personal	1
rights	1
of	1
individuals,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
rights	1
reserved	1
to	1
the	1
States	1
in	1
their	1
political	1
capacity.	1
A	1
fifth	1
is	1
of	1
opinion	1
that	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
rights	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
would	1
be	1
superfluous	1
and	1
misplaced,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
plan	1
would	1
be	1
unexceptionable	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
fatal	1
power	1
of	1
regulating	1
the	1
times	1
and	1
places	1
of	1
election.	1
An	1
objector	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
State	1
exclaims	1
loudly	1
against	1
the	1
unreasonable	1
equality	1
of	1
representation	1
in	1
the	1
Senate.	1
An	1
objector	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
State	1
is	1
equally	1
loud	1
against	1
the	1
dangerous	1
inequality	1
in	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives.	1
From	1
this	1
quarter,	1
we	1
are	1
alarmed	1
with	1
the	1
amazing	1
expense,	1
from	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
persons	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
administer	1
the	1
new	1
government.	1
From	1
another	1
quarter,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
quarter,	1
on	1
another	1
occasion,	1
the	1
cry	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
Congress	1
will	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
a	1
representation,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
would	1
be	1
far	1
less	1
objectionable	1
if	1
the	1
number	1
and	1
the	1
expense	1
were	1
doubled.	1
A	1
patriot	1
in	1
a	1
State	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
import	1
or	1
export,	1
discerns	1
insuperable	1
objections	1
against	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
direct	1
taxation.	1
The	1
patriotic	1
adversary	1
in	1
a	1
State	1
of	1
great	1
exports	1
and	1
imports,	1
is	1
not	1
less	1
dissatisfied	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
burden	1
of	1
taxes	1
may	1
be	1
thrown	1
on	1
consumption.	1
This	1
politician	1
discovers	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution	1
a	1
direct	1
and	1
irresistible	1
tendency	1
to	1
monarchy;	1
that	1
is	1
equally	1
sure	1
it	1
will	1
end	1
in	1
aristocracy.	1
Another	1
is	1
puzzled	1
to	1
say	1
which	1
of	1
these	1
shapes	1
it	1
will	1
ultimately	1
assume,	1
but	1
sees	1
clearly	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
them;	1
whilst	1
a	1
fourth	1
is	1
not	1
wanting,	1
who	1
with	1
no	1
less	1
confidence	1
affirms	1
that	1
the	1
Constitution	1
is	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
having	1
a	1
bias	1
towards	1
either	1
of	1
these	1
dangers,	1
that	1
the	1
weight	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
upright	1
and	1
firm	1
against	1
its	1
opposite	1
propensities.	1
With	1
another	1
class	1
of	1
adversaries	1
to	1
the	1
Constitution	1
the	1
language	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments	1
are	1
intermixed	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
contradict	1
all	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
regular	1
government	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
requisite	1
precautions	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
liberty.	1
Whilst	1
this	1
objection	1
circulates	1
in	1
vague	1
and	1
general	1
expressions,	1
there	1
are	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
who	1
lend	1
their	1
sanction	1
to	1
it.	1
Let	1
each	1
one	1
come	1
forward	1
with	1
his	1
particular	1
explanation,	1
and	1
scarce	1
any	1
two	1
are	1
exactly	1
agreed	1
upon	1
the	1
subject.	1
In	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
one	1
the	1
junction	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
with	1
the	1
President	1
in	1
the	1
responsible	1
function	1
of	1
appointing	1
to	1
offices,	1
instead	1
of	1
vesting	1
this	1
executive	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
Executive	1
alone,	1
is	1
the	1
vicious	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
organization.	1
To	1
another,	1
the	1
exclusion	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
whose	1
numbers	1
alone	1
could	1
be	1
a	1
due	1
security	1
against	1
corruption	1
and	1
partiality	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
power,	1
is	1
equally	1
obnoxious.	1
With	1
another,	1
the	1
admission	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
into	1
any	1
share	1
of	1
a	1
power	1
which	1
ever	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
dangerous	1
engine	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate,	1
is	1
an	1
unpardonable	1
violation	1
of	1
the	1
maxims	1
of	1
republican	1
jealousy.	1
No	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
arrangement,	1
according	1
to	1
some,	1
is	1
more	1
inadmissible	1
than	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
impeachments	1
by	1
the	1
Senate,	1
which	1
is	1
alternately	1
a	1
member	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
executive	1
departments,	1
when	1
this	1
power	1
so	1
evidently	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department.	1
"We	1
concur	1
fully,"	1
reply	1
others,	1
"in	1
the	1
objection	1
to	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
plan,	1
but	1
we	1
can	1
never	1
agree	1
that	1
a	1
reference	1
of	1
impeachments	1
to	1
the	1
judiciary	1
authority	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
amendment	1
of	1
the	1
error.	1
Our	1
principal	1
dislike	1
to	1
the	1
organization	1
arises	1
from	1
the	1
extensive	1
powers	1
already	1
lodged	1
in	1
that	1
department."	1
Even	1
among	1
the	1
zealous	1
patrons	1
of	1
a	1
council	1
of	1
state	1
the	1
most	1
irreconcilable	1
variance	1
is	1
discovered	1
concerning	1
the	1
mode	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
constituted.	1
The	1
demand	1
of	1
one	1
gentleman	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
council	1
should	1
consist	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
numerous	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
Another	1
would	1
prefer	1
a	1
larger	1
number,	1
and	1
considers	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
fundamental	1
condition	1
that	1
the	1
appointment	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
President	1
himself.	1
As	1
it	1
can	1
give	1
no	1
umbrage	1
to	1
the	1
writers	1
against	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution,	1
let	1
us	1
suppose,	1
that	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
zealous,	1
so	1
they	1
are	1
also	1
the	1
most	1
sagacious,	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
think	1
the	1
late	1
convention	1
were	1
unequal	1
to	1
the	1
task	1
assigned	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
wiser	1
and	1
better	1
plan	1
might	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
substituted.	1
Let	1
us	1
further	1
suppose	1
that	1
their	1
country	1
should	1
concur,	1
both	1
in	1
this	1
favorable	1
opinion	1
of	1
their	1
merits,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
unfavorable	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
convention;	1
and	1
should	1
accordingly	1
proceed	1
to	1
form	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
second	1
convention,	1
with	1
full	1
powers,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
express	1
purpose	1
of	1
revising	1
and	1
remoulding	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
first.	1
Were	1
the	1
experiment	1
to	1
be	1
seriously	1
made,	1
though	1
it	1
required	1
some	1
effort	1
to	1
view	1
it	1
seriously	1
even	1
in	1
fiction,	1
I	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
decided	1
by	1
the	1
sample	1
of	1
opinions	1
just	1
exhibited,	1
whether,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
enmity	1
to	1
their	1
predecessors,	1
they	1
would,	1
in	1
any	1
one	1
point,	1
depart	1
so	1
widely	1
from	1
their	1
example,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
discord	1
and	1
ferment	1
that	1
would	1
mark	1
their	1
own	1
deliberations;	1
and	1
whether	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
now	1
before	1
the	1
public,	1
would	1
not	1
stand	1
as	1
fair	1
a	1
chance	1
for	1
immortality,	1
as	1
Lycurgus	1
gave	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
Sparta,	1
by	1
making	1
its	1
change	1
to	1
depend	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
return	1
from	1
exile	1
and	1
death,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
immediately	1
adopted,	1
and	1
were	1
to	1
continue	1
in	1
force,	1
not	1
until	1
a	1
BETTER,	1
but	1
until	1
ANOTHER	1
should	1
be	1
agreed	1
upon	1
by	1
this	1
new	1
assembly	1
of	1
lawgivers.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
both	1
of	1
wonder	1
and	1
regret,	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
raise	1
so	1
many	1
objections	1
against	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution	1
should	1
never	1
call	1
to	1
mind	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
exchanged	1
for	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
former	1
should	1
be	1
perfect;	1
it	1
is	1
sufficient	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
is	1
more	1
imperfect.	1
No	1
man	1
would	1
refuse	1
to	1
give	1
brass	1
for	1
silver	1
or	1
gold,	1
because	1
the	1
latter	1
had	1
some	1
alloy	1
in	1
it.	1
No	1
man	1
would	1
refuse	1
to	1
quit	1
a	1
shattered	1
and	1
tottering	1
habitation	1
for	1
a	1
firm	1
and	1
commodious	1
building,	1
because	1
the	1
latter	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
porch	1
to	1
it,	1
or	1
because	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
rooms	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
larger	1
or	1
smaller,	1
or	1
the	1
ceilings	1
a	1
little	1
higher	1
or	1
lower	1
than	1
his	1
fancy	1
would	1
have	1
planned	1
them.	1
But	1
waiving	1
illustrations	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
manifest	1
that	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
capital	1
objections	1
urged	1
against	1
the	1
new	1
system	1
lie	1
with	1
tenfold	1
weight	1
against	1
the	1
existing	1
Confederation?	1
Is	1
an	1
indefinite	1
power	1
to	1
raise	1
money	1
dangerous	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government?	1
The	1
present	1
Congress	1
can	1
make	1
requisitions	1
to	1
any	1
amount	1
they	1
please,	1
and	1
the	1
States	1
are	1
constitutionally	1
bound	1
to	1
furnish	1
them;	1
they	1
can	1
emit	1
bills	1
of	1
credit	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
will	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
paper;	1
they	1
can	1
borrow,	1
both	1
abroad	1
and	1
at	1
home,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
a	1
shilling	1
will	1
be	1
lent.	1
Is	1
an	1
indefinite	1
power	1
to	1
raise	1
troops	1
dangerous?	1
The	1
Confederation	1
gives	1
to	1
Congress	1
that	1
power	1
also;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
already	1
begun	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
it.	1
Is	1
it	1
improper	1
and	1
unsafe	1
to	1
intermix	1
the	1
different	1
powers	1
of	1
government	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
body	1
of	1
men?	1
Congress,	1
a	1
single	1
body	1
of	1
men,	1
are	1
the	1
sole	1
depositary	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
federal	1
powers.	1
Is	1
it	1
particularly	1
dangerous	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
treasury,	1
and	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
army,	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
hands?	1
The	1
Confederation	1
places	1
them	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Congress.	1
Is	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
rights	1
essential	1
to	1
liberty?	1
The	1
Confederation	1
has	1
no	1
bill	1
of	1
rights.	1
Is	1
it	1
an	1
objection	1
against	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution,	1
that	1
it	1
empowers	1
the	1
Senate,	1
with	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
the	1
Executive,	1
to	1
make	1
treaties	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
land?	1
The	1
existing	1
Congress,	1
without	1
any	1
such	1
control,	1
can	1
make	1
treaties	1
which	1
they	1
themselves	1
have	1
declared,	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
have	1
recognized,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
supreme	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
Is	1
the	1
importation	1
of	1
slaves	1
permitted	1
by	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution	1
for	1
twenty	1
years?	1
By	1
the	1
old	1
it	1
is	1
permitted	1
forever.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
told,	1
that	1
however	1
dangerous	1
this	1
mixture	1
of	1
powers	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
theory,	1
it	1
is	1
rendered	1
harmless	1
by	1
the	1
dependence	1
of	1
Congress	1
on	1
the	1
State	1
for	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
carrying	1
them	1
into	1
practice;	1
that	1
however	1
large	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
powers	1
may	1
be,	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
fact	1
a	1
lifeless	1
mass.	1
Then,	1
say	1
I,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
that	1
the	1
Confederation	1
is	1
chargeable	1
with	1
the	1
still	1
greater	1
folly	1
of	1
declaring	1
certain	1
powers	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
to	1
be	1
absolutely	1
necessary,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
rendering	1
them	1
absolutely	1
nugatory;	1
and,	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
place,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
Union	1
is	1
to	1
continue,	1
and	1
no	1
better	1
government	1
be	1
substituted,	1
effective	1
powers	1
must	1
either	1
be	1
granted	1
to,	1
or	1
assumed	1
by,	1
the	1
existing	1
Congress;	1
in	1
either	1
of	1
which	1
events,	1
the	1
contrast	1
just	1
stated	1
will	1
hold	1
good.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all.	1
Out	1
of	1
this	1
lifeless	1
mass	1
has	1
already	1
grown	1
an	1
excrescent	1
power,	1
which	1
tends	1
to	1
realize	1
all	1
the	1
dangers	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
apprehended	1
from	1
a	1
defective	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
supreme	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
It	1
is	1
now	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
speculation	1
and	1
hope,	1
that	1
the	1
Western	1
territory	1
is	1
a	1
mine	1
of	1
vast	1
wealth	1
to	1
the	1
United	1
States;	1
and	1
although	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
nature	1
as	1
to	1
extricate	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
present	1
distresses,	1
or	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
to	1
yield	1
any	1
regular	1
supplies	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
expenses,	1
yet	1
must	1
it	1
hereafter	1
be	1
able,	1
under	1
proper	1
management,	1
both	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
gradual	1
discharge	1
of	1
the	1
domestic	1
debt,	1
and	1
to	1
furnish,	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
period,	1
liberal	1
tributes	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
treasury.	1
A	1
very	1
large	1
proportion	1
of	1
this	1
fund	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
surrendered	1
by	1
individual	1
States;	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
with	1
reason	1
be	1
expected	1
that	1
the	1
remaining	1
States	1
will	1
not	1
persist	1
in	1
withholding	1
similar	1
proofs	1
of	1
their	1
equity	1
and	1
generosity.	1
We	1
may	1
calculate,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
a	1
rich	1
and	1
fertile	1
country,	1
of	1
an	1
area	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
inhabited	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
will	1
soon	1
become	1
a	1
national	1
stock.	1
Congress	1
have	1
assumed	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
this	1
stock.	1
They	1
have	1
begun	1
to	1
render	1
it	1
productive.	1
Congress	1
have	1
undertaken	1
to	1
do	1
more:	1
they	1
have	1
proceeded	1
to	1
form	1
new	1
States,	1
to	1
erect	1
temporary	1
governments,	1
to	1
appoint	1
officers	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
to	1
prescribe	1
the	1
conditions	1
on	1
which	1
such	1
States	1
shall	1
be	1
admitted	1
into	1
the	1
Confederacy.	1
All	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
done;	1
and	1
done	1
without	1
the	1
least	1
color	1
of	1
constitutional	1
authority.	1
Yet	1
no	1
blame	1
has	1
been	1
whispered;	1
no	1
alarm	1
has	1
been	1
sounded.	1
A	1
GREAT	1
and	1
INDEPENDENT	1
fund	1
of	1
revenue	1
is	1
passing	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
SINGLE	1
BODY	1
of	1
men,	1
who	1
can	1
RAISE	1
TROOPS	1
to	1
an	1
INDEFINITE	1
NUMBER,	1
and	1
appropriate	1
money	1
to	1
their	1
support	1
for	1
an	1
INDEFINITE	1
PERIOD	1
OF	1
TIME.	1
And	1
yet	1
there	1
are	1
men,	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
only	1
been	1
silent	1
spectators	1
of	1
this	1
prospect,	1
but	1
who	1
are	1
advocates	1
for	1
the	1
system	1
which	1
exhibits	1
it;	1
and,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
urge	1
against	1
the	1
new	1
system	1
the	1
objections	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
heard.	1
Would	1
they	1
not	1
act	1
with	1
more	1
consistency,	1
in	1
urging	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
latter,	1
as	1
no	1
less	1
necessary	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
Union	1
against	1
the	1
future	1
powers	1
and	1
resources	1
of	1
a	1
body	1
constructed	1
like	1
the	1
existing	1
Congress,	1
than	1
to	1
save	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
dangers	1
threatened	1
by	1
the	1
present	1
impotency	1
of	1
that	1
Assembly?	1
I	1
mean	1
not,	1
by	1
any	1
thing	1
here	1
said,	1
to	1
throw	1
censure	1

I	1
am	1
sensible	1
they	1

not	1
have	1
done	1
otherwise.	1
The	1
public	1
interest,	1

case,	1
imposed	1
upon	1
them	1
the	1

of	1
overleaping	1

But	1
is	1
not	1
the	1

the	1

a	1

not	1

THE	1
last	1
paper	1
having	1
concluded	1
the	1
observations	1
which	1
were	1
meant	1
to	1
introduce	1
a	1
candid	1
survey	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
government	1
reported	1
by	1
the	1
convention,	1
we	1
now	1
proceed	1
to	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
undertaking.	1
The	1
first	1
question	1
that	1
offers	1
itself	1
is,	1
whether	1
the	1
general	1
form	1
and	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
be	1
strictly	1
republican.	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
no	1
other	1
form	1
would	1
be	1
reconcilable	1
with	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America;	1
with	1
the	1
fundamental	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
Revolution;	1
or	1
with	1
that	1
honorable	1
determination	1
which	1
animates	1
every	1
votary	1
of	1
freedom,	1
to	1
rest	1
all	1
our	1
political	1
experiments	1
on	1
the	1
capacity	1
of	1
mankind	1
for	1
self-government.	1
If	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
therefore,	1
be	1
found	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
the	1
republican	1
character,	1
its	1
advocates	1
must	1
abandon	1
it	1
as	1
no	1
longer	1
defensible.	1
What,	1
then,	1
are	1
the	1
distinctive	1
characters	1
of	1
the	1
republican	1
form?	1
Were	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
question	1
to	1
be	1
sought,	1
not	1
by	1
recurring	1
to	1
principles,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
application	1
of	1
the	1
term	1
by	1
political	1
writers,	1
to	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
different	1
States,	1
no	1
satisfactory	1
one	1
would	1
ever	1
be	1
found.	1
Holland,	1
in	1
which	1
no	1
particle	1
of	1
the	1
supreme	1
authority	1
is	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
has	1
passed	1
almost	1
universally	1
under	1
the	1
denomination	1
of	1
a	1
republic.	1
The	1
same	1
title	1
has	1
been	1
bestowed	1
on	1
Venice,	1
where	1
absolute	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
exercised,	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
absolute	1
manner,	1
by	1
a	1
small	1
body	1
of	1
hereditary	1
nobles.	1
Poland,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
aristocracy	1
and	1
of	1
monarchy	1
in	1
their	1
worst	1
forms,	1
has	1
been	1
dignified	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
appellation.	1
The	1
government	1
of	1
England,	1
which	1
has	1
one	1
republican	1
branch	1
only,	1
combined	1
with	1
an	1
hereditary	1
aristocracy	1
and	1
monarchy,	1
has,	1
with	1
equal	1
impropriety,	1
been	1
frequently	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
republics.	1
These	1
examples,	1
which	1
are	1
nearly	1
as	1
dissimilar	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
genuine	1
republic,	1
show	1
the	1
extreme	1
inaccuracy	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
term	1
has	1
been	1
used	1
in	1
political	1
disquisitions.	1
If	1
we	1
resort	1
for	1
a	1
criterion	1
to	1
the	1
different	1
principles	1
on	1
which	1
different	1
forms	1
of	1
government	1
are	1
established,	1
we	1
may	1
define	1
a	1
republic	1
to	1
be,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
may	1
bestow	1
that	1
name	1
on,	1
a	1
government	1
which	1
derives	1
all	1
its	1
powers	1
directly	1
or	1
indirectly	1
from	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
is	1
administered	1
by	1
persons	1
holding	1
their	1
offices	1
during	1
pleasure,	1
for	1
a	1
limited	1
period,	1
or	1
during	1
good	1
behavior.	1
It	1
is	1
ESSENTIAL	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
government	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
society,	1
not	1
from	1
an	1
inconsiderable	1
proportion,	1
or	1
a	1
favored	1
class	1
of	1
it;	1
otherwise	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
tyrannical	1
nobles,	1
exercising	1
their	1
oppressions	1
by	1
a	1
delegation	1
of	1
their	1
powers,	1
might	1
aspire	1
to	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
republicans,	1
and	1
claim	1
for	1
their	1
government	1
the	1
honorable	1
title	1
of	1
republic.	1
It	1
is	1
SUFFICIENT	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
government	1
that	1
the	1
persons	1
administering	1
it	1
be	1
appointed,	1
either	1
directly	1
or	1
indirectly,	1
by	1
the	1
people;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
hold	1
their	1
appointments	1
by	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
tenures	1
just	1
specified;	1
otherwise	1
every	1
government	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
every	1
other	1
popular	1
government	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
or	1
can	1
be	1
well	1
organized	1
or	1
well	1
executed,	1
would	1
be	1
degraded	1
from	1
the	1
republican	1
character.	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
every	1
State	1
in	1
the	1
Union,	1
some	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
government	1
are	1
appointed	1
indirectly	1
only	1
by	1
the	1
people.	1
According	1
to	1
most	1
of	1
them,	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate	1
himself	1
is	1
so	1
appointed.	1
And	1
according	1
to	1
one,	1
this	1
mode	1
of	1
appointment	1
is	1
extended	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
co-ordinate	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
According	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
constitutions,	1
also,	1
the	1
tenure	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
offices	1
is	1
extended	1
to	1
a	1
definite	1
period,	1
and	1
in	1
many	1
instances,	1
both	1
within	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
executive	1
departments,	1
to	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
years.	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
provisions	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
constitutions,	1
again,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
respectable	1
and	1
received	1
opinions	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department	1
are	1
to	1
retain	1
their	1
offices	1
by	1
the	1
firm	1
tenure	1
of	1
good	1
behavior.	1
On	1
comparing	1
the	1
Constitution	1
planned	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
with	1
the	1
standard	1
here	1
fixed,	1
we	1
perceive	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
it	1
is,	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
rigid	1
sense,	1
conformable	1
to	1
it.	1
The	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
one	1
branch	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
is	1
elected	1
immediately	1
by	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
The	1
Senate,	1
like	1
the	1
present	1
Congress,	1
and	1
the	1
Senate	1
of	1
Maryland,	1
derives	1
its	1
appointment	1
indirectly	1
from	1
the	1
people.	1
The	1
President	1
is	1
indirectly	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
example	1
in	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
Even	1
the	1
judges,	1
with	1
all	1
other	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
will,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
be	1
the	1
choice,	1
though	1
a	1
remote	1
choice,	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
themselves,	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
the	1
appointments	1
is	1
equally	1
conformable	1
to	1
the	1
republican	1
standard,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
State	1
constitutions	1
The	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
is	1
periodically	1
elective,	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
States;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
two	1
years,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
South	1
Carolina.	1
The	1
Senate	1
is	1
elective,	1
for	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
six	1
years;	1
which	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
year	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
of	1
Maryland,	1
and	1
but	1
two	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Senates	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
and	1
Virginia.	1
The	1
President	1
is	1
to	1
continue	1
in	1
office	1
for	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
four	1
years;	1
as	1
in	1
New	1
York	1
and	1
Delaware,	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate	1
is	1
elected	1
for	1
three	1
years,	1
and	1
in	1
South	1
Carolina	1
for	1
two	1
years.	1
In	1
the	1
other	1
States	1
the	1
election	1
is	1
annual.	1
In	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
however,	1
no	1
constitutional	1
provision	1
is	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
impeachment	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate.	1
And	1
in	1
Delaware	1
and	1
Virginia	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
impeachable	1
till	1
out	1
of	1
office.	1
The	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
is	1
impeachable	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
during	1
his	1
continuance	1
in	1
office.	1
The	1
tenure	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
judges	1
are	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
places,	1
is,	1
as	1
it	1
unquestionably	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
that	1
of	1
good	1
behavior.	1
The	1
tenure	1
of	1
the	1
ministerial	1
offices	1
generally,	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
legal	1
regulation,	1
conformably	1
to	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
and	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions.	1
Could	1
any	1
further	1
proof	1
be	1
required	1
of	1
the	1
republican	1
complexion	1
of	1
this	1
system,	1
the	1
most	1
decisive	1
one	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
its	1
absolute	1
prohibition	1
of	1
titles	1
of	1
nobility,	1
both	1
under	1
the	1
federal	1
and	1
the	1
State	1
governments;	1
and	1
in	1
its	1
express	1
guaranty	1
of	1
the	1
republican	1
form	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
latter.	1
"But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
sufficient,"	1
say	1
the	1
adversaries	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
"for	1
the	1
convention	1
to	1
adhere	1
to	1
the	1
republican	1
form.	1
They	1
ought,	1
with	1
equal	1
care,	1
to	1
have	1
preserved	1
the	1
FEDERAL	1
form,	1
which	1
regards	1
the	1
Union	1
as	1
a	1
CONFEDERACY	1
of	1
sovereign	1
states;	1
instead	1
of	1
which,	1
they	1
have	1
framed	1
a	1
NATIONAL	1
government,	1
which	1
regards	1
the	1
Union	1
as	1
a	1
CONSOLIDATION	1
of	1
the	1
States."	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
asked	1
by	1
what	1
authority	1
this	1
bold	1
and	1
radical	1
innovation	1
was	1
undertaken?	1
The	1
handle	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
of	1
this	1
objection	1
requires	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
examined	1
with	1
some	1
precision.	1
Without	1
inquiring	1
into	1
the	1
accuracy	1
of	1
the	1
distinction	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
objection	1
is	1
founded,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
a	1
just	1
estimate	1
of	1
its	1
force,	1
first,	1
to	1
ascertain	1
the	1
real	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
in	1
question;	1
secondly,	1
to	1
inquire	1
how	1
far	1
the	1
convention	1
were	1
authorized	1
to	1
propose	1
such	1
a	1
government;	1
and	1
thirdly,	1
how	1
far	1
the	1
duty	1
they	1
owed	1
to	1
their	1
country	1
could	1
supply	1
any	1
defect	1
of	1
regular	1
authority.	1
First.	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
ascertain	1
the	1
real	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
foundation	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
established;	1
to	1
the	1
sources	1
from	1
which	1
its	1
ordinary	1
powers	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
drawn;	1
to	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
those	1
powers;	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
authority	1
by	1
which	1
future	1
changes	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
introduced.	1
On	1
examining	1
the	1
first	1
relation,	1
it	1
appears,	1
on	1
one	1
hand,	1
that	1
the	1
Constitution	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
founded	1
on	1
the	1
assent	1
and	1
ratification	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America,	1
given	1
by	1
deputies	1
elected	1
for	1
the	1
special	1
purpose;	1
but,	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
that	1
this	1
assent	1
and	1
ratification	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
not	1
as	1
individuals	1
composing	1
one	1
entire	1
nation,	1
but	1
as	1
composing	1
the	1
distinct	1
and	1
independent	1
States	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
respectively	1
belong.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
assent	1
and	1
ratification	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
supreme	1
authority	1
in	1
each	1
State,	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
themselves.	1
The	1
act,	1
therefore,	1
establishing	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
NATIONAL,	1
but	1
a	1
FEDERAL	1
act.	1
That	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
federal	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
national	1
act,	1
as	1
these	1
terms	1
are	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
objectors;	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
as	1
forming	1
so	1
many	1
independent	1
States,	1
not	1
as	1
forming	1
one	1
aggregate	1
nation,	1
is	1
obvious	1
from	1
this	1
single	1
consideration,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
result	1
neither	1
from	1
the	1
decision	1
of	1
a	1
MAJORITY	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
nor	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
MAJORITY	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
It	1
must	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
UNANIMOUS	1
assent	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States	1
that	1
are	1
parties	1
to	1
it,	1
differing	1
no	1
otherwise	1
from	1
their	1
ordinary	1
assent	1
than	1
in	1
its	1
being	1
expressed,	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority,	1
but	1
by	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
themselves.	1
Were	1
the	1
people	1
regarded	1
in	1
this	1
transaction	1
as	1
forming	1
one	1
nation,	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
would	1
bind	1
the	1
minority,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
as	1
the	1
majority	1
in	1
each	1
State	1
must	1
bind	1
the	1
minority;	1
and	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
majority	1
must	1
be	1
determined	1
either	1
by	1
a	1
comparison	1
of	1
the	1
individual	1
votes,	1
or	1
by	1
considering	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
as	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
Neither	1
of	1
these	1
rules	1
have	1
been	1
adopted.	1
Each	1
State,	1
in	1
ratifying	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
is	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
sovereign	1
body,	1
independent	1
of	1
all	1
others,	1
and	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
by	1
its	1
own	1
voluntary	1
act.	1
In	1
this	1
relation,	1
then,	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution	1
will,	1
if	1
established,	1
be	1
a	1
FEDERAL,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
NATIONAL	1
constitution.	1
The	1
next	1
relation	1
is,	1
to	1
the	1
sources	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
ordinary	1
powers	1
of	1
government	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
derived.	1
The	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
will	1
derive	1
its	1
powers	1
from	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America;	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
be	1
represented	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
proportion,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
principle,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
legislature	1
of	1
a	1
particular	1
State.	1
So	1
far	1
the	1
government	1
is	1
NATIONAL,	1
not	1
FEDERAL.	1
The	1
Senate,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
will	1
derive	1
its	1
powers	1
from	1
the	1
States,	1
as	1
political	1
and	1
coequal	1
societies;	1
and	1
these	1
will	1
be	1
represented	1
on	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
equality	1
in	1
the	1
Senate,	1
as	1
they	1
now	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
existing	1
Congress.	1
So	1
far	1
the	1
government	1
is	1
FEDERAL,	1
not	1
NATIONAL.	1
The	1
executive	1
power	1
will	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
a	1
very	1
compound	1
source.	1
The	1
immediate	1
election	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
States	1
in	1
their	1
political	1
characters.	1
The	1
votes	1
allotted	1
to	1
them	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
compound	1
ratio,	1
which	1
considers	1
them	1
partly	1
as	1
distinct	1
and	1
coequal	1
societies,	1
partly	1
as	1
unequal	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
society.	1
The	1
eventual	1
election,	1
again,	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
by	1
that	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
which	1
consists	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
representatives;	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
particular	1
act	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
individual	1
delegations,	1
from	1
so	1
many	1
distinct	1
and	1
coequal	1
bodies	1
politic.	1
From	1
this	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
it	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
mixed	1
character,	1
presenting	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
many	1
FEDERAL	1
as	1
NATIONAL	1
features.	1
The	1
difference	1
between	1
a	1
federal	1
and	1
national	1
government,	1
as	1
it	1
relates	1
to	1
the	1
OPERATION	1
OF	1
THE	1
GOVERNMENT,	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
consist	1
in	1
this,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
former	1
the	1
powers	1
operate	1
on	1
the	1
political	1
bodies	1
composing	1
the	1
Confederacy,	1
in	1
their	1
political	1
capacities;	1
in	1
the	1
latter,	1
on	1
the	1
individual	1
citizens	1
composing	1
the	1
nation,	1
in	1
their	1
individual	1
capacities.	1
On	1
trying	1
the	1
Constitution	1
by	1
this	1
criterion,	1
it	1
falls	1
under	1
the	1
NATIONAL,	1
not	1
the	1
FEDERAL	1
character;	1
though	1
perhaps	1
not	1
so	1
completely	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
understood.	1
In	1
several	1
cases,	1
and	1
particularly	1
in	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
controversies	1
to	1
which	1
States	1
may	1
be	1
parties,	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
viewed	1
and	1
proceeded	1
against	1
in	1
their	1
collective	1
and	1
political	1
capacities	1
only.	1
So	1
far	1
the	1
national	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
disfigured	1
by	1
a	1
few	1
federal	1
features.	1
But	1
this	1
blemish	1
is	1
perhaps	1
unavoidable	1
in	1
any	1
plan;	1
and	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
on	1
the	1
people,	1
in	1
their	1
individual	1
capacities,	1
in	1
its	1
ordinary	1
and	1
most	1
essential	1
proceedings,	1
may,	1
on	1
the	1
whole,	1
designate	1
it,	1
in	1
this	1
relation,	1
a	1
NATIONAL	1
government.	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
government	1
be	1
national	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
OPERATION	1
of	1
its	1
powers,	1
it	1
changes	1
its	1
aspect	1
again	1
when	1
we	1
contemplate	1
it	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
EXTENT	1
of	1
its	1
powers.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
national	1
government	1
involves	1
in	1
it,	1
not	1
only	1
an	1
authority	1
over	1
the	1
individual	1
citizens,	1
but	1
an	1
indefinite	1
supremacy	1
over	1
all	1
persons	1
and	1
things,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
objects	1
of	1
lawful	1
government.	1
Among	1
a	1
people	1
consolidated	1
into	1
one	1
nation,	1
this	1
supremacy	1
is	1
completely	1
vested	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
legislature.	1
Among	1
communities	1
united	1
for	1
particular	1
purposes,	1
it	1
is	1
vested	1
partly	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
partly	1
in	1
the	1
municipal	1
legislatures.	1
In	1
the	1
former	1
case,	1
all	1
local	1
authorities	1
are	1
subordinate	1
to	1
the	1
supreme;	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
controlled,	1
directed,	1
or	1
abolished	1
by	1
it	1
at	1
pleasure.	1
In	1
the	1
latter,	1
the	1
local	1
or	1
municipal	1
authorities	1
form	1
distinct	1
and	1
independent	1
portions	1
of	1
the	1
supremacy,	1
no	1
more	1
subject,	1
within	1
their	1
respective	1
spheres,	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
authority,	1
than	1
the	1
general	1
authority	1
is	1
subject	1
to	1
them,	1
within	1
its	1
own	1
sphere.	1
In	1
this	1
relation,	1
then,	1
the	1
proposed	1
government	1
cannot	1
be	1
deemed	1
a	1
NATIONAL	1
one;	1
since	1
its	1
jurisdiction	1
extends	1
to	1
certain	1
enumerated	1
objects	1
only,	1
and	1
leaves	1
to	1
the	1
several	1
States	1
a	1
residuary	1
and	1
inviolable	1
sovereignty	1
over	1
all	1
other	1
objects.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
in	1
controversies	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
boundary	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
jurisdictions,	1
the	1
tribunal	1
which	1
is	1
ultimately	1
to	1
decide,	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
established	1
under	1
the	1
general	1
government.	1
But	1
this	1
does	1
not	1
change	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
the	1
case.	1
The	1
decision	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
impartially	1
made,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
usual	1
and	1
most	1
effectual	1
precautions	1
are	1
taken	1
to	1
secure	1
this	1
impartiality.	1
Some	1
such	1
tribunal	1
is	1
clearly	1
essential	1
to	1
prevent	1
an	1
appeal	1
to	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
a	1
dissolution	1
of	1
the	1
compact;	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
established	1
under	1
the	1
general	1
rather	1
than	1
under	1
the	1
local	1
governments,	1
or,	1
to	1
speak	1
more	1
properly,	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
safely	1
established	1
under	1
the	1
first	1
alone,	1
is	1
a	1
position	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
combated.	1
If	1
we	1
try	1
the	1
Constitution	1
by	1
its	1
last	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
authority	1
by	1
which	1
amendments	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
made,	1
we	1
find	1
it	1
neither	1
wholly	1
NATIONAL	1
nor	1
wholly	1
FEDERAL.	1
Were	1
it	1
wholly	1
national,	1
the	1
supreme	1
and	1
ultimate	1
authority	1
would	1
reside	1
in	1
the	1
MAJORITY	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
Union;	1
and	1
this	1
authority	1
would	1
be	1
competent	1
at	1
all	1
times,	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
every	1
national	1
society,	1
to	1
alter	1
or	1
abolish	1
its	1
established	1
government.	1
Were	1
it	1
wholly	1
federal,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
each	1
State	1
in	1
the	1
Union	1
would	1
be	1
essential	1
to	1
every	1
alteration	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
binding	1
on	1
all.	1
The	1
mode	1
provided	1
by	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
is	1
not	1
founded	1
on	1
either	1
of	1
these	1
principles.	1
In	1
requiring	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
majority,	1
and	1
principles.	1
In	1
requiring	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
majority,	1
and	1
particularly	1
in	1
computing	1
the	1
proportion	1
by	1
STATES,	1
not	1
by	1
CITIZENS,	1
it	1
departs	1
from	1
the	1
NATIONAL	1
and	1
advances	1
towards	1
the	1
FEDERAL	1
character;	1
in	1
rendering	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
whole	1
number	1
of	1
States	1
sufficient,	1
it	1
loses	1
again	1
the	1
FEDERAL	1
and	1
partakes	1
of	1
the	1
NATIONAL	1
character.	1
The	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
therefore,	1
is,	1
in	1
strictness,	1
neither	1
a	1
national	1
nor	1
a	1
federal	1
Constitution,	1
but	1
a	1
composition	1
of	1
both.	1
In	1
its	1
foundation	1
it	1
is	1
federal,	1
not	1
national;	1
in	1
the	1
sources	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
ordinary	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
are	1
drawn,	1
it	1
is	1
partly	1
federal	1
and	1
partly	1
national;	1
in	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
these	1
powers,	1
it	1
is	1
national,	1
not	1
federal;	1
in	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
them,	1
again,	1
it	1
is	1
federal,	1
not	1
national;	1
and,	1
finally,	1
in	1
the	1
authoritative	1
mode	1
of	1
introducing	1
amendments,	1
it	1
is	1
neither	1
wholly	1
federal	1
nor	1
wholly	1
national.	1

MADISON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
SECOND	1
point	1
to	1
be	1
examined	1
is,	1
whether	1
the	1
convention	1
were	1
authorized	1
to	1
frame	1
and	1
propose	1
this	1
mixed	1
Constitution.	1
The	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
ought,	1
in	1
strictness,	1
to	1
be	1
determined	1
by	1
an	1
inspection	1
of	1
the	1
commissions	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
members	1
by	1
their	1
respective	1
constituents.	1
As	1
all	1
of	1
these,	1
however,	1
had	1
reference,	1
either	1
to	1
the	1
recommendation	1
from	1
the	1
meeting	1
at	1
Annapolis,	1
in	1
September,	1
1786,	1
or	1
to	1
that	1
from	1
Congress,	1
in	1
February,	1
1787,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
recur	1
to	1
these	1
particular	1
acts.	1
The	1
act	1
from	1
Annapolis	1
recommends	1
the	1
"appointment	1
of	1
commissioners	1
to	1
take	1
into	1
consideration	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States;	1
to	1
devise	1
SUCH	1
FURTHER	1
PROVISIONS	1
as	1
shall	1
appear	1
to	1
them	1
necessary	1
to	1
render	1
the	1
Constitution	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
ADEQUATE	1

THE	1
EXIGENCIES	1
OF	1
THE	1

and	1
to	1

an	1

for	1
that	1
purpose,	1
to	1
the	1
United	1

agreed	1
to	1
by	1
them,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
confirmed	1
by	1
the	1
legislature	1
of	1
every	1
State,	1
will	1
effectually	1
provide	1
for	1
the	1
same.	1
"The	1
recommendatory	1
act	1
of	1

in	1

is	1
expressed	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
Congress,	1
or	1
by	1
SUCH	1
FURTHER	1
PROVISIONS	1
AS	1
SHOULD	1
APPEAR	1
NECESSARY,	1
as	1
it	1
stands	1
in	1
the	1
recommendatory	1
act	1
from	1
Annapolis;	1
4th,	1
that	1
the	1
alterations	1
and	1
provisions	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
reported	1
to	1
Congress,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
States,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
agreed	1
to	1
by	1
the	1
former	1
and	1
confirmed	1
by	1
the	1
latter.	1
From	1
a	1
comparison	1
and	1
fair	1
construction	1
of	1
these	1
several	1
modes	1
of	1
expression,	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
deduced	1
the	1
authority	1
under	1
which	1
the	1
convention	1
acted.	1
They	1
were	1
to	1
frame	1
a	1
NATIONAL	1
GOVERNMENT,	1
adequate	1
to	1
the	1
EXIGENCIES	1
OF	1
GOVERNMENT,	1
and	1
OF	1
THE	1
UNION;	1
and	1
to	1
reduce	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation	1
into	1
such	1
form	1
as	1
to	1
accomplish	1
these	1
purposes.	1
There	1
are	1
two	1
rules	1
of	1
construction,	1
dictated	1
by	1
plain	1
reason,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
founded	1
on	1
legal	1
axioms.	1
The	1
one	1
is,	1
that	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
expression	1
ought,	1
if	1
possible,	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
some	1
meaning,	1
and	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
conspire	1
to	1
some	1
common	1
end.	1
The	1
other	1
is,	1
that	1
where	1
the	1
several	1
parts	1
cannot	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
coincide,	1
the	1
less	1
important	1
should	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
more	1
important	1
part;	1
the	1
means	1
should	1
be	1
sacrificed	1
to	1
the	1
end,	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
means.	1
Suppose,	1
then,	1
that	1
the	1
expressions	1
defining	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
were	1
irreconcilably	1
at	1
variance	1
with	1
each	1
other;	1
that	1
a	1
NATIONAL	1
and	1
ADEQUATE	1
GOVERNMENT	1
could	1
not	1
possibly,	1
in	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
be	1
affected	1
by	1
ALTERATIONS	1
and	1
PROVISIONS	1
in	1
the	1
ARTICLES	1
OF	1
CONFEDERATION;	1
which	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
definition	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
embraced,	1
and	1
which	1
rejected?	1
Which	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
important,	1
which	1
the	1
less	1
important	1
part?	1
Which	1
the	1
end;	1
which	1
the	1
means?	1
Let	1
the	1
most	1
scrupulous	1
expositors	1
of	1
delegated	1
powers;	1
let	1
the	1
most	1
inveterate	1
objectors	1
against	1
those	1
exercised	1
by	1
the	1
convention,	1
answer	1
these	1
questions.	1
Let	1
them	1
declare,	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
most	1
importance	1
to	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America,	1
that	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation	1
should	1
be	1
disregarded,	1
and	1
an	1
adequate	1
government	1
be	1
provided,	1
and	1
the	1
Union	1
preserved;	1
or	1
that	1
an	1
adequate	1
government	1
should	1
be	1
omitted,	1
and	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation	1
preserved.	1
Let	1
them	1
declare,	1
whether	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
these	1
articles	1
was	1
the	1
end,	1
for	1
securing	1
which	1
a	1
reform	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
introduced	1
as	1
the	1
means;	1
or	1
whether	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
a	1
government,	1
adequate	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
happiness,	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
at	1
which	1
these	1
articles	1
themselves	1
originally	1
aimed,	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
ought,	1
as	1
insufficient	1
means,	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
sacrificed.	1
But	1
is	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
these	1
expressions	1
are	1
absolutely	1
irreconcilable	1
to	1
each	1
other;	1
that	1
no	1
ALTERATIONS	1
or	1
PROVISIONS	1
in	1
THE	1
ARTICLES	1
OF	1
THE	1
CONFEDERATION	1
could	1
possibly	1
mould	1
them	1
into	1
a	1
national	1
and	1
adequate	1
government;	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
government	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
proposed	1
by	1
the	1
convention?	1
No	1
stress,	1
it	1
is	1
presumed,	1
will,	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
be	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
TITLE;	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
that	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
deemed	1
an	1
exercise	1
of	1
ungranted	1
power.	1
ALTERATIONS	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
instrument	1
are	1
expressly	1
authorized.	1
NEW	1
PROVISIONS	1
therein	1
are	1
also	1
expressly	1
authorized.	1
Here	1
then	1
is	1
a	1
power	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
title;	1
to	1
insert	1
new	1
articles;	1
to	1
alter	1
old	1
ones.	1
Must	1
it	1
of	1
necessity	1
be	1
admitted	1
that	1
this	1
power	1
is	1
infringed,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
articles	1
remain?	1
Those	1
who	1
maintain	1
the	1
affirmative	1
ought	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
mark	1
the	1
boundary	1
between	1
authorized	1
and	1
usurped	1
innovations;	1
between	1
that	1
degree	1
of	1
change	1
which	1
lies	1
within	1
the	1
compass	1
of	1
ALTERATIONS	1
AND	1
FURTHER	1
PROVISIONS,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
amounts	1
to	1
a	1
TRANSMUTATION	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
Will	1
it	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
alterations	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
touched	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation?	1
The	1
States	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
appointed	1
a	1
convention	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
solemnity,	1
nor	1
described	1
its	1
objects	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
latitude,	1
if	1
some	1
SUBSTANTIAL	1
reform	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
contemplation.	1
Will	1
it	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
FUNDAMENTAL	1
PRINCIPLES	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation	1
were	1
not	1
within	1
the	1
purview	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
and	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
varied?	1
I	1
ask,	1
What	1
are	1
these	1
principles?	1
Do	1
they	1
require	1
that,	1
in	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
the	1
States	1
should	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
distinct	1
and	1
independent	1
sovereigns?	1
They	1
are	1
so	1
regarded	1
by	1
the	1
Constitution	1
proposed.	1
Do	1
they	1
require	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
should	1
derive	1
their	1
appointment	1
from	1
the	1
legislatures,	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
States?	1
One	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
government	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
by	1
these	1
legislatures;	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
Confederation,	1
the	1
delegates	1
to	1
Congress	1
MAY	1
ALL	1
be	1
appointed	1
immediately	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
in	1
two	1
States1	1
are	1
actually	1
so	1
appointed.	1
Do	1
they	1
require	1
that	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
should	1
act	1
on	1
the	1
States,	1
and	1
not	1
immediately	1
on	1
individuals?	1
In	1
some	1
instances,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
shown,	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
government	1
will	1
act	1
on	1
the	1
States	1
in	1
their	1
collective	1
characters.	1
In	1
some	1
instances,	1
also,	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
existing	1
government	1
act	1
immediately	1
on	1
individuals.	1
In	1
cases	1
of	1
capture;	1
of	1
piracy;	1
of	1
the	1
post	1
office;	1
of	1
coins,	1
weights,	1
and	1
measures;	1
of	1
trade	1
with	1
the	1
Indians;	1
of	1
claims	1
under	1
grants	1
of	1
land	1
by	1
different	1
States;	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
trials	1
by	1
courts-marshal	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
navy,	1
by	1
which	1
death	1
may	1
be	1
inflicted	1
without	1
the	1
intervention	1
of	1
a	1
jury,	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
a	1
civil	1
magistrate;	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
cases	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation	1
operate	1
immediately	1
on	1
the	1
persons	1
and	1
interests	1
of	1
individual	1
citizens.	1
Do	1
these	1
fundamental	1
principles	1
require,	1
particularly,	1
that	1
no	1
tax	1
should	1
be	1
levied	1
without	1
the	1
intermediate	1
agency	1
of	1
the	1
States?	1
The	1
Confederation	1
itself	1
authorizes	1
a	1
direct	1
tax,	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
extent,	1
on	1
the	1
post	1
office.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
coinage	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
construed	1
by	1
Congress	1
as	1
to	1
levy	1
a	1
tribute	1
immediately	1
from	1
that	1
source	1
also.	1
But	1
pretermitting	1
these	1
instances,	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
an	1
acknowledged	1
object	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
and	1
the	1
universal	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
the	1
regulation	1
of	1
trade	1
should	1
be	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
form	1
as	1
would	1
render	1
it	1
an	1
immediate	1
source	1
of	1
general	1
revenue?	1
Had	1
not	1
Congress	1
repeatedly	1
recommended	1
this	1
measure	1
as	1
not	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
the	1
fundamental	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation?	1
Had	1
not	1
every	1
State	1
but	1
one;	1
had	1
not	1
New	1
York	1
herself,	1
so	1
far	1
complied	1
with	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
Congress	1
as	1
to	1
recognize	1
the	1
PRINCIPLE	1
of	1
the	1
innovation?	1
Do	1
these	1
principles,	1
in	1
fine,	1
require	1
that	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
should	1
be	1
limited,	1
and	1
that,	1
beyond	1
this	1
limit,	1
the	1
States	1
should	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
their	1
sovereignty	1
and	1
independence?	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
government,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
old,	1
the	1
general	1
powers	1
are	1
limited;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
States,	1
in	1
all	1
unenumerated	1
cases,	1
are	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
their	1
sovereign	1
and	1
independent	1
jurisdiction.	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
proposed	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
less	1
as	1
absolutely	1
new,	1
than	1
as	1
the	1
expansion	1
of	1
principles	1
which	1
are	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation.	1
The	1
misfortune	1
under	1
the	1
latter	1
system	1
has	1
been,	1
that	1
these	1
principles	1
are	1
so	1
feeble	1
and	1
confined	1
as	1
to	1
justify	1
all	1
the	1
charges	1
of	1
inefficiency	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
urged	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
require	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
enlargement	1
which	1
gives	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
system	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
an	1
entire	1
transformation	1
of	1
the	1
old.	1
In	1
one	1
particular	1
it	1
is	1
admitted	1
that	1
the	1
convention	1
have	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
tenor	1
of	1
their	1
commission.	1
Instead	1
of	1
reporting	1
a	1
plan	1
requiring	1
the	1
confirmation	1
OF	1
THE	1
LEGISLATURES	1
OF	1
ALL	1
THE	1
STATES,	1
they	1
have	1
reported	1
a	1
plan	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
confirmed	1
by	1
the	1
PEOPLE,	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
effect	1
by	1
NINE	1
STATES	1
ONLY.	1
It	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
remark	1
that	1
this	1
objection,	1
though	1
the	1
most	1
plausible,	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
least	1
urged	1
in	1
the	1
publications	1
which	1
have	1
swarmed	1
against	1
the	1
convention.	1
The	1
forbearance	1
can	1
only	1
have	1
proceeded	1
from	1
an	1
irresistible	1
conviction	1
of	1
the	1
absurdity	1
of	1
subjecting	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
twelve	1
States	1
to	1
the	1
perverseness	1
or	1
corruption	1
of	1
a	1
thirteenth;	1
from	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
inflexible	1
opposition	1
given	1
by	1
a	1
MAJORITY	1
of	1
one	1
sixtieth	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
to	1
a	1
measure	1
approved	1
and	1
called	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
twelve	1
States,	1
comprising	1
fifty-nine	1
sixtieths	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
an	1
example	1
still	1
fresh	1
in	1
the	1
memory	1
and	1
indignation	1
of	1
every	1
citizen	1
who	1
has	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
wounded	1
honor	1
and	1
prosperity	1
of	1
his	1
country.	1
As	1
this	1
objection,	1
therefore,	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
waived	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
criticised	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
I	1
dismiss	1
it	1
without	1
further	1
observation.	1
The	1
THIRD	1
point	1
to	1
be	1
inquired	1
into	1
is,	1
how	1
far	1
considerations	1
of	1
duty	1
arising	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
itself	1
could	1
have	1
supplied	1
any	1
defect	1
of	1
regular	1
authority.	1
In	1
the	1
preceding	1
inquiries	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
have	1
been	1
analyzed	1
and	1
tried	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
rigor,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
rules,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
real	1
and	1
final	1
powers	1
for	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
a	1
Constitution	1
for	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
they	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
trial	1
even	1
on	1
that	1
supposition.	1
It	1
is	1
time	1
now	1
to	1
recollect	1
that	1
the	1
powers	1
were	1
merely	1
advisory	1
and	1
recommendatory;	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
meant	1
by	1
the	1
States,	1
and	1
so	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
convention;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
have	1
accordingly	1
planned	1
and	1
proposed	1
a	1
Constitution	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
more	1
consequence	1
than	1
the	1
paper	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
stamped	1
with	1
the	1
approbation	1
of	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
addressed.	1
This	1
reflection	1
places	1
the	1
subject	1
in	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
altogether	1
different,	1
and	1
will	1
enable	1
us	1
to	1
judge	1
with	1
propriety	1
of	1
the	1
course	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
convention.	1
Let	1
us	1
view	1
the	1
ground	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
convention	1
stood.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
collected	1
from	1
their	1
proceedings,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
deeply	1
and	1
unanimously	1
impressed	1
with	1
the	1
crisis,	1
which	1
had	1
led	1
their	1
country	1
almost	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
to	1
make	1
so	1
singular	1
and	1
solemn	1
an	1
experiment	1
for	1
correcting	1
the	1
errors	1
of	1
a	1
system	1
by	1
which	1
this	1
crisis	1
had	1
been	1
produced;	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
no	1
less	1
deeply	1
and	1
unanimously	1
convinced	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
reform	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
proposed	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
effect	1
the	1
purposes	1
of	1
their	1
appointment.	1
It	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
unknown	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
hopes	1
and	1
expectations	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
citizens,	1
throughout	1
this	1
great	1
empire,	1
were	1
turned	1
with	1
the	1
keenest	1
anxiety	1
to	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
their	1
deliberations.	1
They	1
had	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
contrary	1
sentiments	1
agitated	1
the	1
minds	1
and	1
bosoms	1
of	1
every	1
external	1
and	1
internal	1
foe	1
to	1
the	1
liberty	1
and	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
They	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
origin	1
and	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
experiment,	1
the	1
alacrity	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
PROPOSITION,	1
made	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
State	1
(Virginia),	1
towards	1
a	1
partial	1
amendment	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation,	1
had	1
been	1
attended	1
to	1
and	1
promoted.	1
They	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
LIBERTY	1
ASSUMED	1
by	1
a	1
VERY	1
FEW	1
deputies	1
from	1
a	1
VERY	1
FEW	1
States,	1
convened	1
at	1
Annapolis,	1
of	1
recommending	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
critical	1
object,	1
wholly	1
foreign	1
to	1
their	1
commission,	1
not	1
only	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
public	1
opinion,	1
but	1
actually	1
carried	1
into	1
effect	1
by	1
twelve	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
thirteen	1
States.	1
They	1
had	1
seen,	1
in	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
instances,	1
assumptions	1
by	1
Congress,	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
recommendatory,	1
but	1
of	1
operative,	1
powers,	1
warranted,	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
estimation,	1
by	1
occasions	1
and	1
objects	1
infinitely	1
less	1
urgent	1
than	1
those	1
by	1
which	1
their	1
conduct	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
governed.	1
They	1
must	1
have	1
reflected,	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
great	1
changes	1
of	1
established	1
governments,	1
forms	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
substance;	1
that	1
a	1
rigid	1
adherence	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
to	1
the	1
former,	1
would	1
render	1
nominal	1
and	1
nugatory	1
the	1
transcendent	1
and	1
precious	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
"abolish	1
or	1
alter	1
their	1
governments	1
as	1
to	1
them	1
shall	1
seem	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
effect	1
their	1
safety	1
and	1
happiness,"2	1
since	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
spontaneously	1
and	1
universally	1
to	1
move	1
in	1
concert	1
towards	1
their	1
object;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
therefore	1
essential	1
that	1
such	1
changes	1
be	1
instituted	1
by	1
some	1
INFORMAL	1
AND	1
UNAUTHORIZED	1
PROPOSITIONS,	1
made	1
by	1
some	1
patriotic	1
and	1
respectable	1
citizen	1
or	1
number	1
of	1
citizens.	1
They	1
must	1
have	1
recollected	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
this	1
irregular	1
and	1
assumed	1
privilege	1
of	1
proposing	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
plans	1
for	1
their	1
safety	1
and	1
happiness,	1
that	1
the	1
States	1
were	1
first	1
united	1
against	1
the	1
danger	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
threatened	1
by	1
their	1
ancient	1
government;	1
that	1
committees	1
and	1
congresses	1
were	1
formed	1
for	1
concentrating	1
their	1
efforts	1
and	1
defending	1
their	1
rights;	1
and	1
that	1
CONVENTIONS	1
were	1
ELECTED	1
in	1
THE	1
SEVERAL	1
STATES	1
for	1
establishing	1
the	1
constitutions	1
under	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
now	1
governed;	1
nor	1
could	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
forgotten	1
that	1
no	1
little	1
ill-timed	1
scruples,	1
no	1
zeal	1
for	1
adhering	1
to	1
ordinary	1
forms,	1
were	1
anywhere	1
seen,	1
except	1
in	1
those	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
indulge,	1
under	1
these	1
masks,	1
their	1
secret	1
enmity	1
to	1
the	1
substance	1
contended	1
for.	1
They	1
must	1
have	1
borne	1
in	1
mind,	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
plan	1
to	1
be	1
framed	1
and	1
proposed	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
submitted	1
TO	1
THE	1
PEOPLE	1
THEMSELVES,	1
the	1
disapprobation	1
of	1
this	1
supreme	1
authority	1
would	1
destroy	1
it	1
forever;	1
its	1
approbation	1
blot	1
out	1
antecedent	1
errors	1
and	1
irregularities.	1
It	1
might	1
even	1
have	1
occurred	1
to	1
them,	1
that	1
where	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
cavil	1
prevailed,	1
their	1
neglect	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
power	1
vested	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
their	1
recommendation	1
of	1
any	1
measure	1
whatever,	1
not	1
warranted	1
by	1
their	1
commission,	1
would	1
not	1
less	1
excite	1
animadversion,	1
than	1
a	1
recommendation	1
at	1
once	1
of	1
a	1
measure	1
fully	1
commensurate	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
exigencies.	1
Had	1
the	1
convention,	1
under	1
all	1
these	1
impressions,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
considerations,	1
instead	1
of	1
exercising	1
a	1
manly	1
confidence	1
in	1
their	1
country,	1
by	1
whose	1
confidence	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
peculiarly	1
distinguished,	1
and	1
of	1
pointing	1
out	1
a	1
system	1
capable,	1
in	1
their	1
judgment,	1
of	1
securing	1
its	1
happiness,	1
taken	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
sullen	1
resolution	1
of	1
disappointing	1
its	1
ardent	1
hopes,	1
of	1
sacrificing	1
substance	1
to	1
forms,	1
of	1
committing	1
the	1
dearest	1
interests	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
to	1
the	1
uncertainties	1
of	1
delay	1
and	1
the	1
hazard	1
of	1
events,	1
let	1
me	1
ask	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
can	1
raise	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
one	1
elevated	1
conception,	1
who	1
can	1
awaken	1
in	1
his	1
bosom	1
one	1
patriotic	1
emotion,	1
what	1
judgment	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
pronounced	1
by	1
the	1
impartial	1
world,	1
by	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
mankind,	1
by	1
every	1
virtuous	1
citizen,	1
on	1
the	1
conduct	1
and	1
character	1
of	1
this	1
assembly?	1
Or	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
propensity	1
to	1
condemn	1
is	1
susceptible	1
of	1
no	1
control,	1
let	1
me	1
then	1
ask	1
what	1
sentence	1
he	1
has	1
in	1
reserve	1
for	1
the	1
twelve	1
States	1
who	1
USURPED	1
THE	1
POWER	1
of	1
sending	1
deputies	1
to	1
the	1
convention,	1
a	1
body	1
utterly	1
unknown	1
to	1
their	1
constitutions;	1
for	1
Congress,	1
who	1
recommended	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
this	1
body,	1
equally	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
Confederation;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
in	1
particular,	1
which	1
first	1
urged	1
and	1
then	1
complied	1
with	1
this	1
unauthorized	1
interposition?	1
But	1
that	1
the	1
objectors	1
may	1
be	1
disarmed	1
of	1
every	1
pretext,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
granted	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
that	1
the	1
convention	1
were	1
neither	1
authorized	1
by	1
their	1
commission,	1
nor	1
justified	1
by	1
circumstances	1
in	1
proposing	1
a	1
Constitution	1
for	1
their	1
country:	1
does	1
it	1
follow	1
that	1
the	1
Constitution	1
ought,	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
alone,	1
to	1
be	1
rejected?	1
If,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
noble	1
precept,	1
it	1
be	1
lawful	1
to	1
accept	1
good	1
advice	1
even	1
from	1
an	1
enemy,	1
shall	1
we	1
set	1
the	1
ignoble	1
example	1
of	1
refusing	1
such	1
advice	1
even	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
offered	1
by	1
our	1
friends?	1
The	1
prudent	1
inquiry,	1
in	1
all	1
cases,	1
ought	1
surely	1
to	1
be,	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
FROM	1
WHOM	1
the	1
advice	1
comes,	1
as	1
whether	1
the	1
advice	1
be	1
GOOD.	1
The	1
sum	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
here	1
advanced	1
and	1
proved	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
charge	1
against	1
the	1
convention	1
of	1
exceeding	1
their	1
powers,	1
except	1
in	1
one	1
instance	1
little	1
urged	1
by	1
the	1
objectors,	1
has	1
no	1
foundation	1
to	1
support	1
it;	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
exceeded	1
their	1
powers,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
only	1
warranted,	1
but	1
required,	1
as	1
the	1
confidential	1
servants	1
of	1
their	1
country,	1
by	1
the	1
circumstances	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
placed,	1
to	1
exercise	1
the	1
liberty	1
which	1
they	1
assume;	1
and	1
that	1
finally,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
violated	1
both	1
their	1
powers	1
and	1
their	1
obligations,	1
in	1
proposing	1
a	1
Constitution,	1
this	1
ought	1
nevertheless	1
to	1
be	1
embraced,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
calculated	1
to	1
accomplish	1
the	1
views	1
and	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America.	1
How	1
far	1
this	1
character	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
is	1
the	1
subject	1
under	1

THE	1
Constitution	1
proposed	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
under	1
two	1
general	1
points	1
of	1
view.	1
The	1
FIRST	1
relates	1
to	1
the	1
sum	1
or	1
quantity	1
of	1
power	1
which	1
it	1
vests	1
in	1
the	1
government,	1
including	1
the	1
restraints	1
imposed	1
on	1
the	1
States.	1
The	1
SECOND,	1
to	1
the	1
particular	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
the	1
distribution	1
of	1
this	1
power	1
among	1
its	1
several	1
branches.	1
Under	1
the	1
FIRST	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
subject,	1
two	1
important	1
questions	1
arise:	1
1.	1
Whether	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
powers	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
be	1
unnecessary	1
or	1
improper?	1
2.	1
Whether	1
the	1
entire	1
mass	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
dangerous	1
to	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
jurisdiction	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
States?	1
Is	1
the	1
aggregate	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
greater	1
than	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
vested	1
in	1
it?	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
FIRST	1
question.	1
It	1
cannot	1
have	1
escaped	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
attended	1
with	1
candor	1
to	1
the	1
arguments	1
employed	1
against	1
the	1
extensive	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
that	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
very	1
little	1
considered	1
how	1
far	1
these	1
powers	1
were	1
necessary	1
means	1
of	1
attaining	1
a	1
necessary	1
end.	1
They	1
have	1
chosen	1
rather	1
to	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
inconveniences	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
unavoidably	1
blended	1
with	1
all	1
political	1
advantages;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
possible	1
abuses	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
incident	1
to	1
every	1
power	1
or	1
trust,	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
beneficial	1
use	1
can	1
be	1
made.	1
This	1
method	1
of	1
handling	1
the	1
subject	1
cannot	1
impose	1
on	1
the	1
good	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America.	1
It	1
may	1
display	1
the	1
subtlety	1
of	1
the	1
writer;	1
it	1
may	1
open	1
a	1
boundless	1
field	1
for	1
rhetoric	1
and	1
declamation;	1
it	1
may	1
inflame	1
the	1
passions	1
of	1
the	1
unthinking,	1
and	1
may	1
confirm	1
the	1
prejudices	1
of	1
the	1
misthinking:	1
but	1
cool	1
and	1
candid	1
people	1
will	1
at	1
once	1
reflect,	1
that	1
the	1
purest	1
of	1
human	1
blessings	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
alloy	1
in	1
them;	1
that	1
the	1
choice	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
made,	1
if	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
lesser	1
evil,	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
GREATER,	1
not	1
the	1
PERFECT,	1
good;	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
every	1
political	1
institution,	1
a	1
power	1
to	1
advance	1
the	1
public	1
happiness	1
involves	1
a	1
discretion	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
misapplied	1
and	1
abused.	1
They	1
will	1
see,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
where	1
power	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
conferred,	1
the	1
point	1
first	1
to	1
be	1
decided	1
is,	1
whether	1
such	1
a	1
power	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
good;	1
as	1
the	1
next	1
will	1
be,	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
an	1
affirmative	1
decision,	1
to	1
guard	1
as	1
effectually	1
as	1
possible	1
against	1
a	1
perversion	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
detriment.	1
That	1
we	1
may	1
form	1
a	1
correct	1
judgment	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
proper	1
to	1
review	1
the	1
several	1
powers	1
conferred	1
on	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
Union;	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
more	1
conveniently	1
done	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
reduced	1
into	1
different	1
classes	1
as	1
they	1
relate	1
to	1
the	1
following	1
different	1
objects:	1
1.	1
Security	1
against	1
foreign	1
danger;	1
2.	1
Regulation	1
of	1
the	1
intercourse	1
with	1
foreign	1
nations;	1
3.	1
Maintenance	1
of	1
harmony	1
and	1
proper	1
intercourse	1
among	1
the	1
States;	1
4.	1
Certain	1
miscellaneous	1
objects	1
of	1
general	1
utility;	1
5.	1
Restraint	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
from	1
certain	1
injurious	1
acts;	1
6.	1
Provisions	1
for	1
giving	1
due	1
efficacy	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
powers.	1
The	1
powers	1
falling	1
within	1
the	1
FIRST	1
class	1
are	1
those	1
of	1
declaring	1
war	1
and	1
granting	1
letters	1
of	1
marque;	1
of	1
providing	1
armies	1
and	1
fleets;	1
of	1
regulating	1
and	1
calling	1
forth	1
the	1
militia;	1
of	1
levying	1
and	1
borrowing	1
money.	1
Security	1
against	1
foreign	1
danger	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
primitive	1
objects	1
of	1
civil	1
society.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
avowed	1
and	1
essential	1
object	1
of	1
the	1
American	1
Union.	1
The	1
powers	1
requisite	1
for	1
attaining	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
effectually	1
confided	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
councils.	1
Is	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
declaring	1
war	1
necessary?	1
No	1
man	1
will	1
answer	1
this	1
question	1
in	1
the	1
negative.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
superfluous,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
affirmative.	1
The	1
existing	1
Confederation	1
establishes	1
this	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
ample	1
form.	1
Is	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
raising	1
armies	1
and	1
equipping	1
fleets	1
necessary?	1
This	1
is	1
involved	1
in	1
the	1
foregoing	1
power.	1
It	1
is	1
involved	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
self-defense.	1
But	1
was	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
INDEFINITE	1
POWER	1
of	1
raising	1
TROOPS,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
providing	1
fleets;	1
and	1
of	1
maintaining	1
both	1
in	1
PEACE,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
war?	1
The	1
answer	1
to	1
these	1
questions	1
has	1
been	1
too	1
far	1
anticipated	1
in	1
another	1
place	1
to	1
admit	1
an	1
extensive	1
discussion	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
place.	1
The	1
answer	1
indeed	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
obvious	1
and	1
conclusive	1
as	1
scarcely	1
to	1
justify	1
such	1
a	1
discussion	1
in	1
any	1
place.	1
With	1
what	1
color	1
of	1
propriety	1
could	1
the	1
force	1
necessary	1
for	1
defense	1
be	1
limited	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
cannot	1
limit	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
offense?	1
If	1
a	1
federal	1
Constitution	1
could	1
chain	1
the	1
ambition	1
or	1
set	1
bounds	1
to	1
the	1
exertions	1
of	1
all	1
other	1
nations,	1
then	1
indeed	1
might	1
it	1
prudently	1
chain	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
government,	1
and	1
set	1
bounds	1
to	1
the	1
exertions	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
safety.	1
How	1
could	1
a	1
readiness	1
for	1
war	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace	1
be	1
safely	1
prohibited,	1
unless	1
we	1
could	1
prohibit,	1
in	1
like	1
manner,	1
the	1
preparations	1
and	1
establishments	1
of	1
every	1
hostile	1
nation?	1
The	1
means	1
of	1
security	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
regulated	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
and	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
attack.	1
They	1
will,	1
in	1
fact,	1
be	1
ever	1
determined	1
by	1
these	1
rules,	1
and	1
by	1
no	1
others.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
oppose	1
constitutional	1
barriers	1
to	1
the	1
impulse	1
of	1
self-preservation.	1
It	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
in	1
vain;	1
because	1
it	1
plants	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution	1
itself	1
necessary	1
usurpations	1
of	1
power,	1
every	1
precedent	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
germ	1
of	1
unnecessary	1
and	1
multiplied	1
repetitions.	1
If	1
one	1
nation	1
maintains	1
constantly	1
a	1
disciplined	1
army,	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
ambition	1
or	1
revenge,	1
it	1
obliges	1
the	1
most	1
pacific	1
nations	1
who	1
may	1
be	1
within	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
its	1
enterprises	1
to	1
take	1
corresponding	1
precautions.	1
The	1
fifteenth	1
century	1
was	1
the	1
unhappy	1
epoch	1
of	1
military	1
establishments	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
peace.	1
They	1
were	1
introduced	1
by	1
Charles	1
VII.	1
of	1
France.	1
All	1
Europe	1
has	1
followed,	1
or	1
been	1
forced	1
into,	1
the	1
example.	1
Had	1
the	1
example	1
not	1
been	1
followed	1
by	1
other	1
nations,	1
all	1
Europe	1
must	1
long	1
ago	1
have	1
worn	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
a	1
universal	1
monarch.	1
Were	1
every	1
nation	1
except	1
France	1
now	1
to	1
disband	1
its	1
peace	1
establishments,	1
the	1
same	1
event	1
might	1
follow.	1
The	1
veteran	1
legions	1
of	1
Rome	1
were	1
an	1
overmatch	1
for	1
the	1
undisciplined	1
valor	1
of	1
all	1
other	1
nations	1
and	1
rendered	1
her	1
the	1
mistress	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Not	1
the	1
less	1
true	1
is	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
Rome	1
proved	1
the	1
final	1
victim	1
to	1
her	1
military	1
triumphs;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
Europe,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
ever	1
existed,	1
have,	1
with	1
few	1
exceptions,	1
been	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
her	1
military	1
establishments.	1
A	1
standing	1
force,	1
therefore,	1
is	1
a	1
dangerous,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
necessary,	1
provision.	1
On	1
the	1
smallest	1
scale	1
it	1
has	1
its	1
inconveniences.	1
On	1
an	1
extensive	1
scale	1
its	1
consequences	1
may	1
be	1
fatal.	1
On	1
any	1
scale	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
laudable	1
circumspection	1
and	1
precaution.	1
A	1
wise	1
nation	1
will	1
combine	1
all	1
these	1
considerations;	1
and,	1
whilst	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
rashly	1
preclude	1
itself	1
from	1
any	1
resource	1
which	1
may	1
become	1
essential	1
to	1
its	1
safety,	1
will	1
exert	1
all	1
its	1
prudence	1
in	1
diminishing	1
both	1
the	1
necessity	1
and	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
resorting	1
to	1
one	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
inauspicious	1
to	1
its	1
liberties.	1
The	1
clearest	1
marks	1
of	1
this	1
prudence	1
are	1
stamped	1
on	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution.	1
The	1
Union	1
itself,	1
which	1
it	1
cements	1
and	1
secures,	1
destroys	1
every	1
pretext	1
for	1
a	1
military	1
establishment	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
dangerous.	1
America	1
united,	1
with	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
troops,	1
or	1
without	1
a	1
single	1
soldier,	1
exhibits	1
a	1
more	1
forbidding	1
posture	1
to	1
foreign	1
ambition	1
than	1
America	1
disunited,	1
with	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
veterans	1
ready	1
for	1
combat.	1
It	1
was	1
remarked,	1
on	1
a	1
former	1
occasion,	1
that	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
this	1
pretext	1
had	1
saved	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
one	1
nation	1
in	1
Europe.	1
Being	1
rendered	1
by	1
her	1
insular	1
situation	1
and	1
her	1
maritime	1
resources	1
impregnable	1
to	1
the	1
armies	1
of	1
her	1
neighbors,	1
the	1
rulers	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
able,	1
by	1
real	1
or	1
artificial	1
dangers,	1
to	1
cheat	1
the	1
public	1
into	1
an	1
extensive	1
peace	1
establishment.	1
The	1
distance	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
from	1
the	1
powerful	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
gives	1
them	1
the	1
same	1
happy	1
security.	1
A	1
dangerous	1
establishment	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
necessary	1
or	1
plausible,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
continue	1
a	1
united	1
people.	1
But	1
let	1
it	1
never,	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
be	1
forgotten	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
indebted	1
for	1
this	1
advantage	1
to	1
the	1
Union	1
alone.	1
The	1
moment	1
of	1
its	1
dissolution	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
order	1
of	1
things.	1
The	1
fears	1
of	1
the	1
weaker,	1
or	1
the	1
ambition	1
of	1
the	1
stronger	1
States,	1
or	1
Confederacies,	1
will	1
set	1
the	1
same	1
example	1
in	1
the	1
New,	1
as	1
Charles	1
VII.	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
World.	1
The	1
example	1
will	1
be	1
followed	1
here	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
motives	1
which	1
produced	1
universal	1
imitation	1
there.	1
Instead	1
of	1
deriving	1
from	1
our	1
situation	1
the	1
precious	1
advantage	1
which	1
Great	1
Britain	1
has	1
derived	1
from	1
hers,	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
America	1
will	1
be	1
but	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
continent	1
of	1
Europe.	1
It	1
will	1
present	1
liberty	1
everywhere	1
crushed	1
between	1
standing	1
armies	1
and	1
perpetual	1
taxes.	1
The	1
fortunes	1
of	1
disunited	1
America	1
will	1
be	1
even	1
more	1
disastrous	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
Europe.	1
The	1
sources	1
of	1
evil	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
are	1
confined	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
limits.	1
No	1
superior	1
powers	1
of	1
another	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
globe	1
intrigue	1
among	1
her	1
rival	1
nations,	1
inflame	1
their	1
mutual	1
animosities,	1
and	1
render	1
them	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
foreign	1
ambition,	1
jealousy,	1
and	1
revenge.	1
In	1
America	1
the	1
miseries	1
springing	1
from	1
her	1
internal	1
jealousies,	1
contentions,	1
and	1
wars,	1
would	1
form	1
a	1
part	1
only	1
of	1
her	1
lot.	1
A	1
plentiful	1
addition	1
of	1
evils	1
would	1
have	1
their	1
source	1
in	1
that	1
relation	1
in	1
which	1
Europe	1
stands	1
to	1
this	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
which	1
no	1
other	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
bears	1
to	1
Europe.	1
This	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
disunion	1
cannot	1
be	1
too	1
highly	1
colored,	1
or	1
too	1
often	1
exhibited.	1
Every	1
man	1
who	1
loves	1
peace,	1
every	1
man	1
who	1
loves	1
his	1
country,	1
every	1
man	1
who	1
loves	1
liberty,	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
ever	1
before	1
his	1
eyes,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
cherish	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
a	1
due	1
attachment	1
to	1
the	1
Union	1
of	1
America,	1
and	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
set	1
a	1
due	1
value	1
on	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
preserving	1
it.	1
Next	1
to	1
the	1
effectual	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
the	1
best	1
possible	1
precaution	1
against	1
danger	1
from	1
standing	1
armies	1
is	1
a	1
limitation	1
of	1
the	1
term	1
for	1
which	1
revenue	1
may	1
be	1
appropriated	1
to	1
their	1
support.	1
This	1
precaution	1
the	1
Constitution	1
has	1
prudently	1
added.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
repeat	1
here	1
the	1
observations	1
which	1
I	1
flatter	1
myself	1
have	1
placed	1
this	1
subject	1
in	1
a	1
just	1
and	1
satisfactory	1
light.	1
But	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
improper	1
to	1
take	1
notice	1
of	1
an	1
argument	1
against	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
policy	1
and	1
practice	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain.	1
It	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
continuance	1
of	1
an	1
army	1
in	1
that	1
kingdom	1
requires	1
an	1
annual	1
vote	1
of	1
the	1
legislature;	1
whereas	1
the	1
American	1
Constitution	1
has	1
lengthened	1
this	1
critical	1
period	1
to	1
two	1
years.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
form	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
comparison	1
is	1
usually	1
stated	1
to	1
the	1
public:	1
but	1
is	1
it	1
a	1
just	1
form?	1
Is	1
it	1
a	1
fair	1
comparison?	1
Does	1
the	1
British	1
Constitution	1
restrain	1
the	1
parliamentary	1
discretion	1
to	1
one	1
year?	1
Does	1
the	1
American	1
impose	1
on	1
the	1
Congress	1
appropriations	1
for	1
two	1
years?	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
the	1
fallacy	1
themselves,	1
that	1
the	1
British	1
Constitution	1
fixes	1
no	1
limit	1
whatever	1
to	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
American	1
ties	1
down	1
the	1
legislature	1
to	1
two	1
years,	1
as	1
the	1
longest	1
admissible	1
term.	1
Had	1
the	1
argument	1
from	1
the	1
British	1
example	1
been	1
truly	1
stated,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
stood	1
thus:	1
The	1
term	1
for	1
which	1
supplies	1
may	1
be	1
appropriated	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
establishment,	1
though	1
unlimited	1
by	1
the	1
British	1
Constitution,	1
has	1
nevertheless,	1
in	1
practice,	1
been	1
limited	1
by	1
parliamentary	1
discretion	1
to	1
a	1
single	1
year.	1
Now,	1
if	1
in	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
where	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Commons	1
is	1
elected	1
for	1
seven	1
years;	1
where	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
are	1
elected	1
by	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
where	1
the	1
electors	1
are	1
so	1
corrupted	1
by	1
the	1
representatives,	1
and	1
the	1
representatives	1
so	1
corrupted	1
by	1
the	1
Crown,	1
the	1
representative	1
body	1
can	1
possess	1
a	1
power	1
to	1
make	1
appropriations	1
to	1
the	1
army	1
for	1
an	1
indefinite	1
term,	1
without	1
desiring,	1
or	1
without	1
daring,	1
to	1
extend	1
the	1
term	1
beyond	1
a	1
single	1
year,	1
ought	1
not	1
suspicion	1
herself	1
to	1
blush,	1
in	1
pretending	1
that	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
elected	1
FREELY	1
by	1
the	1
WHOLE	1
BODY	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
every	1
SECOND	1
YEAR,	1
cannot	1
be	1
safely	1
intrusted	1
with	1
the	1
discretion	1
over	1
such	1
appropriations,	1
expressly	1
limited	1
to	1
the	1
short	1
period	1
of	1
TWO	1
YEARS?	1
A	1
bad	1
cause	1
seldom	1
fails	1
to	1
betray	1
itself.	1
Of	1
this	1
truth,	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
the	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
is	1
an	1
unvaried	1
exemplification.	1
But	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
blunders	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
committed,	1
none	1
is	1
more	1
striking	1
than	1
the	1
attempt	1
to	1
enlist	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
the	1
prudent	1
jealousy	1
entertained	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
of	1
standing	1
armies.	1
The	1
attempt	1
has	1
awakened	1
fully	1
the	1
public	1
attention	1
to	1
that	1
important	1
subject;	1
and	1
has	1
led	1
to	1
investigations	1
which	1
must	1
terminate	1
in	1
a	1
thorough	1
and	1
universal	1
conviction,	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
the	1
constitution	1
has	1
provided	1
the	1
most	1
effectual	1
guards	1
against	1
danger	1
from	1
that	1
quarter,	1
but	1
that	1
nothing	1
short	1
of	1
a	1
Constitution	1
fully	1
adequate	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
defense	1
and	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
can	1
save	1
America	1
from	1
as	1
many	1
standing	1
armies	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
split	1
into	1
States	1
or	1
Confederacies,	1
and	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
progressive	1
augmentation,	1
of	1
these	1
establishments	1
in	1
each,	1
as	1
will	1
render	1
them	1
as	1
burdensome	1
to	1
the	1
properties	1
and	1
ominous	1
to	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
as	1
any	1
establishment	1
that	1
can	1
become	1
necessary,	1
under	1
a	1
united	1
and	1
efficient	1
government,	1
must	1
be	1
tolerable	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
and	1
safe	1
to	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
palpable	1
necessity	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
provide	1
and	1
maintain	1
a	1
navy	1
has	1
protected	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
against	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
censure,	1
which	1
has	1
spared	1
few	1
other	1
parts.	1
It	1
must,	1
indeed,	1
be	1
numbered	1
among	1
the	1
greatest	1
blessings	1
of	1
America,	1
that	1
as	1
her	1
Union	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
source	1
of	1
her	1
maritime	1
strength,	1
so	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
principal	1
source	1
of	1
her	1
security	1
against	1
danger	1
from	1
abroad.	1
In	1
this	1
respect	1
our	1
situation	1
bears	1
another	1
likeness	1
to	1
the	1
insular	1
advantage	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain.	1
The	1
batteries	1
most	1
capable	1
of	1
repelling	1
foreign	1
enterprises	1
on	1
our	1
safety,	1
are	1
happily	1
such	1
as	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
turned	1
by	1
a	1
perfidious	1
government	1
against	1
our	1
liberties.	1
The	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
Atlantic	1
frontier	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
deeply	1
interested	1
in	1
this	1
provision	1
for	1
naval	1
protection,	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
hitherto	1
been	1
suffered	1
to	1
sleep	1
quietly	1
in	1
their	1
beds;	1
if	1
their	1
property	1
has	1
remained	1
safe	1
against	1
the	1
predatory	1
spirit	1
of	1
licentious	1
adventurers;	1
if	1
their	1
maritime	1
towns	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
compelled	1
to	1
ransom	1
themselves	1
from	1
the	1
terrors	1
of	1
a	1
conflagration,	1
by	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
exactions	1
of	1
daring	1
and	1
sudden	1
invaders,	1
these	1
instances	1
of	1
good	1
fortune	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
ascribed	1
to	1
the	1
capacity	1
of	1
the	1
existing	1
government	1
for	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
those	1
from	1
whom	1
it	1
claims	1
allegiance,	1
but	1
to	1
causes	1
that	1
are	1
fugitive	1
and	1
fallacious.	1
If	1
we	1
except	1
perhaps	1
Virginia	1
and	1
Maryland,	1
which	1
are	1
peculiarly	1
vulnerable	1
on	1
their	1
eastern	1
frontiers,	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
ought	1
to	1
feel	1
more	1
anxiety	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
than	1
New	1
York.	1
Her	1
seacoast	1
is	1
extensive.	1
A	1
very	1
important	1
district	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
is	1
an	1
island.	1
The	1
State	1
itself	1
is	1
penetrated	1
by	1
a	1
large	1
navigable	1
river	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
fifty	1
leagues.	1
The	1
great	1
emporium	1
of	1
its	1
commerce,	1
the	1
great	1
reservoir	1
of	1
its	1
wealth,	1
lies	1
every	1
moment	1
at	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
events,	1
and	1
may	1
almost	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
hostage	1
for	1
ignominious	1
compliances	1
with	1
the	1
dictates	1
of	1
a	1
foreign	1
enemy,	1
or	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
rapacious	1
demands	1
of	1
pirates	1
and	1
barbarians.	1
Should	1
a	1
war	1
be	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
precarious	1
situation	1
of	1
European	1
affairs,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
unruly	1
passions	1
attending	1
it	1
be	1
let	1
loose	1
on	1
the	1
ocean,	1
our	1
escape	1
from	1
insults	1
and	1
depredations,	1
not	1
only	1
on	1
that	1
element,	1
but	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
bordering	1
on	1
it,	1
will	1
be	1
truly	1
miraculous.	1
In	1
the	1
present	1
condition	1
of	1
America,	1
the	1
States	1
more	1
immediately	1
exposed	1
to	1
these	1
calamities	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
hope	1
from	1
the	1
phantom	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
government	1
which	1
now	1
exists;	1
and	1
if	1
their	1
single	1
resources	1
were	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
fortifying	1
themselves	1
against	1
the	1
danger,	1
the	1
object	1
to	1
be	1
protected	1
would	1
be	1
almost	1
consumed	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
protecting	1
them.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
regulating	1
and	1
calling	1
forth	1
the	1
militia	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
sufficiently	1
vindicated	1
and	1
explained.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
levying	1
and	1
borrowing	1
money,	1
being	1
the	1
sinew	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
exerted	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
defense,	1
is	1
properly	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
class	1
with	1
it.	1
This	1
power,	1
also,	1
has	1
been	1
examined	1
already	1
with	1
much	1
attention,	1
and	1
has,	1
I	1
trust,	1
been	1
clearly	1
shown	1
to	1
be	1
necessary,	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
extent	1
and	1
form	1
given	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
I	1
will	1
address	1
one	1
additional	1
reflection	1
only	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
contend	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
restrained	1
to	1
external	1
taxation	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
mean,	1
taxes	1
on	1
articles	1
imported	1
from	1
other	1
countries.	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
doubted	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
a	1
valuable	1
source	1
of	1
revenue;	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
principal	1
source;	1
that	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
essential	1
one.	1
But	1
we	1
may	1
form	1
very	1
mistaken	1
ideas	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
call	1
to	1
mind	1
in	1
our	1
calculations,	1
that	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
revenue	1
drawn	1
from	1
foreign	1
commerce	1
must	1
vary	1
with	1
the	1
variations,	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
extent	1
and	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
imports;	1
and	1
that	1
these	1
variations	1
do	1
not	1
correspond	1
with	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
population,	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
general	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
wants.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
agriculture	1
continues	1
the	1
sole	1
field	1
of	1
labor,	1
the	1
importation	1
of	1
manufactures	1
must	1
increase	1
as	1
the	1
consumers	1
multiply.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
domestic	1
manufactures	1
are	1
begun	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
not	1
called	1
for	1
by	1
agriculture,	1
the	1
imported	1
manufactures	1
will	1
decrease	1
as	1
the	1
numbers	1
of	1
people	1
increase.	1
In	1
a	1
more	1
remote	1
stage,	1
the	1
imports	1
may	1
consist	1
in	1
a	1
considerable	1
part	1
of	1
raw	1
materials,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
wrought	1
into	1
articles	1
for	1
exportation,	1
and	1
will,	1
therefore,	1
require	1
rather	1
the	1
encouragement	1
of	1
bounties,	1
than	1
to	1
be	1
loaded	1
with	1
discouraging	1
duties.	1
A	1
system	1
of	1
government,	1
meant	1
for	1
duration,	1
ought	1
to	1
contemplate	1
these	1
revolutions,	1
and	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
accommodate	1
itself	1
to	1
them.	1
Some,	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
denied	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
taxation,	1
have	1
grounded	1
a	1
very	1
fierce	1
attack	1
against	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
on	1
the	1
language	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
defined.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
urged	1
and	1
echoed,	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
"to	1
lay	1
and	1
collect	1
taxes,	1
duties,	1
imposts,	1
and	1
excises,	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
debts,	1
and	1
provide	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
defense	1
and	1
general	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,"	1
amounts	1
to	1
an	1
unlimited	1
commission	1
to	1
exercise	1
every	1
power	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
alleged	1
to	1
be	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
defense	1
or	1
general	1
welfare.	1
No	1
stronger	1
proof	1
could	1
be	1
given	1
of	1
the	1
distress	1
under	1
which	1
these	1
writers	1
labor	1
for	1
objections,	1
than	1
their	1
stooping	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
misconstruction.	1
Had	1
no	1
other	1
enumeration	1
or	1
definition	1
of	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
Congress	1
been	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
than	1
the	1
general	1
expressions	1
just	1
cited,	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
the	1
objection	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
color	1
for	1
it;	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
difficult	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
so	1
awkward	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
describing	1
an	1
authority	1
to	1
legislate	1
in	1
all	1
possible	1
cases.	1
A	1
power	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
the	1
press,	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury,	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
descents,	1
or	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
conveyances,	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
singularly	1
expressed	1
by	1
the	1
terms	1
"to	1
raise	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
welfare.	1
"But	1
what	1
color	1
can	1
the	1
objection	1
have,	1
when	1
a	1
specification	1
of	1
the	1
objects	1
alluded	1
to	1
by	1
these	1
general	1
terms	1
immediately	1
follows,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
even	1
separated	1
by	1
a	1
longer	1
pause	1
than	1
a	1
semicolon?	1
If	1
the	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
instrument	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
expounded,	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
meaning	1
to	1
every	1
part	1
which	1
will	1
bear	1
it,	1
shall	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sentence	1
be	1
excluded	1
altogether	1
from	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
meaning;	1
and	1
shall	1
the	1
more	1
doubtful	1
and	1
indefinite	1
terms	1
be	1
retained	1
in	1
their	1
full	1
extent,	1
and	1
the	1
clear	1
and	1
precise	1
expressions	1
be	1
denied	1
any	1
signification	1
whatsoever?	1
For	1
what	1
purpose	1
could	1
the	1
enumeration	1
of	1
particular	1
powers	1
be	1
inserted,	1
if	1
these	1
and	1
all	1
others	1
were	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
included	1
in	1
the	1
preceding	1
general	1
power?	1
Nothing	1
is	1
more	1
natural	1
nor	1
common	1
than	1
first	1
to	1
use	1
a	1
general	1
phrase,	1
and	1
then	1
to	1
explain	1
and	1
qualify	1
it	1
by	1
a	1
recital	1
of	1
particulars.	1
But	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
an	1
enumeration	1
of	1
particulars	1
which	1
neither	1
explain	1
nor	1
qualify	1
the	1
general	1
meaning,	1
and	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
other	1
effect	1
than	1
to	1
confound	1
and	1
mislead,	1
is	1
an	1
absurdity,	1
which,	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
dilemma	1
of	1
charging	1
either	1
on	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
the	1
objection	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
we	1
must	1
take	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
supposing,	1
had	1
not	1
its	1
origin	1
with	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
objection	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
extraordinary,	1
as	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
the	1
language	1
used	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
is	1
a	1
copy	1
from	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation.	1
The	1
objects	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
among	1
the	1
States,	1
as	1
described	1
in	1
article	1
third,	1
are	1
"their	1
common	1
defense,	1
security	1
of	1
their	1
liberties,	1
and	1
mutual	1
and	1
general	1
welfare.	1
"	1
The	1
terms	1
of	1
article	1
eighth	1
are	1
still	1
more	1
identical:	1
"All	1
charges	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
all	1
other	1
expenses	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
incurred	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
defense	1
or	1
general	1
welfare,	1
and	1
allowed	1
by	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
in	1
Congress,	1
shall	1
be	1
defrayed	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
treasury,"	1
etc.	1
A	1
similar	1
language	1
again	1
occurs	1
in	1
article	1
ninth.	1
Construe	1
either	1
of	1
these	1
articles	1
by	1
the	1
rules	1
which	1
would	1
justify	1
the	1
construction	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution,	1
and	1
they	1
vest	1
in	1
the	1
existing	1
Congress	1
a	1
power	1
to	1
legislate	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
whatsoever.	1
But	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
assembly,	1
if,	1
attaching	1
themselves	1
to	1
these	1
general	1
expressions,	1
and	1
disregarding	1
the	1
specifications	1
which	1
ascertain	1
and	1
limit	1
their	1
import,	1
they	1
had	1
exercised	1
an	1
unlimited	1
power	1
of	1
providing	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
defense	1
and	1
general	1
welfare?	1
I	1
appeal	1
to	1
the	1
objectors	1
themselves,	1
whether	1
they	1
would	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
have	1
employed	1
the	1
same	1
reasoning	1
in	1
justification	1
of	1
Congress	1
as	1
they	1
now	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
against	1
the	1
convention.	1
How	1
difficult	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
error	1
to	1
escape	1
its	1
own	1
condemnation!	1

To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1

York:	1
THE	1
SECOND	1
class	1
of	1
powers,	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
government,	1
consists	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
regulate	1
the	1
intercourse	1
with	1
foreign	1
nations,	1
to	1
wit:	1
to	1
make	1
treaties;	1
to	1
send	1
and	1
receive	1
ambassadors,	1
other	1
public	1
ministers,	1
and	1
consuls;	1
to	1
define	1
and	1
punish	1
piracies	1
and	1
felonies	1
committed	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
seas,	1
and	1
offenses	1
against	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
nations;	1
to	1
regulate	1
foreign	1
commerce,	1
including	1
a	1
power	1
to	1
prohibit,	1
after	1
the	1
year	1
1808,	1
the	1
importation	1
of	1
slaves,	1
and	1
to	1
lay	1
an	1
intermediate	1
duty	1
of	1
ten	1
dollars	1
per	1
head,	1
as	1
a	1
discouragement	1
to	1
such	1
importations.	1
This	1
class	1
of	1
powers	1
forms	1
an	1
obvious	1
and	1
essential	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
administration.	1
If	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
nation	1
in	1
any	1
respect,	1
it	1
clearly	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
other	1
nations.	1
The	1
powers	1
to	1
make	1
treaties	1
and	1
to	1
send	1
and	1
receive	1
ambassadors,	1
speak	1
their	1
own	1
propriety.	1
Both	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
comprised	1
in	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation,	1
with	1
this	1
difference	1
only,	1
that	1
the	1
former	1
is	1
disembarrassed,	1
by	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
of	1
an	1
exception,	1
under	1
which	1
treaties	1
might	1
be	1
substantially	1
frustrated	1
by	1
regulations	1
of	1
the	1
States;	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
appointing	1
and	1
receiving	1
"other	1
public	1
ministers	1
and	1
consuls,"	1
is	1
expressly	1
and	1
very	1
properly	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
provision	1
concerning	1
ambassadors.	1
The	1
term	1
ambassador,	1
if	1
taken	1
strictly,	1
as	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
required	1
by	1
the	1
second	1
of	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation,	1
comprehends	1
the	1
highest	1
grade	1
only	1
of	1
public	1
ministers,	1
and	1
excludes	1
the	1
grades	1
which	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
prefer,	1
where	1
foreign	1
embassies	1
may	1
be	1
necessary.	1
And	1
under	1
no	1
latitude	1
of	1
construction	1
will	1
the	1
term	1
comprehend	1
consuls.	1
Yet	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
expedient,	1
and	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
Congress,	1
to	1
employ	1
the	1
inferior	1
grades	1
of	1
public	1
ministers,	1
and	1
to	1
send	1
and	1
receive	1
consuls.	1
It	1
is	1
true,	1
that	1
where	1
treaties	1
of	1
commerce	1
stipulate	1
for	1
the	1
mutual	1
appointment	1
of	1
consuls,	1
whose	1
functions	1
are	1
connected	1
with	1
commerce,	1
the	1
admission	1
of	1
foreign	1
consuls	1
may	1
fall	1
within	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
commercial	1
treaties;	1
and	1
that	1
where	1
no	1
such	1
treaties	1
exist,	1
the	1
mission	1
of	1
American	1
consuls	1
into	1
foreign	1
countries	1
may	1
PERHAPS	1
be	1
covered	1
under	1
the	1
authority,	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
ninth	1
article	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation,	1
to	1
appoint	1
all	1
such	1
civil	1
officers	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
necessary	1
for	1
managing	1
the	1
general	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
But	1
the	1
admission	1
of	1
consuls	1
into	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
where	1
no	1
previous	1
treaty	1
has	1
stipulated	1
it,	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
nowhere	1
provided	1
for.	1
A	1
supply	1
of	1
the	1
omission	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
lesser	1
instances	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
convention	1
have	1
improved	1
on	1
the	1
model	1
before	1
them.	1
But	1
the	1
most	1
minute	1
provisions	1
become	1
important	1
when	1
they	1
tend	1
to	1
obviate	1
the	1
necessity	1
or	1
the	1
pretext	1
for	1
gradual	1
and	1
unobserved	1
usurpations	1
of	1
power.	1
A	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
cases	1
in	1
which	1
Congress	1
have	1
been	1
betrayed,	1
or	1
forced	1
by	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation,	1
into	1
violations	1
of	1
their	1
chartered	1
authorities,	1
would	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
surprise	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
subject;	1
and	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
inconsiderable	1
argument	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution,	1
which	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
provided	1
no	1
less	1
studiously	1
for	1
the	1
lesser,	1
than	1
the	1
more	1
obvious	1
and	1
striking	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
old.	1
The	1
power	1
to	1
define	1
and	1
punish	1
piracies	1
and	1
felonies	1
committed	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
seas,	1
and	1
offenses	1
against	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
nations,	1
belongs	1
with	1
equal	1
propriety	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
government,	1
and	1
is	1
a	1
still	1
greater	1
improvement	1
on	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation.	1
These	1
articles	1
contain	1
no	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
offenses	1
against	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
nations;	1
and	1
consequently	1
leave	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
any	1
indiscreet	1
member	1
to	1
embroil	1
the	1
Confederacy	1
with	1
foreign	1
nations.	1
The	1
provision	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
articles	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
piracies	1
and	1
felonies	1
extends	1
no	1
further	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
courts	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
these	1
offenses.	1
The	1
definition	1
of	1
piracies	1
might,	1
perhaps,	1
without	1
inconveniency,	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
nations;	1
though	1
a	1
legislative	1
definition	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
found	1
in	1
most	1
municipal	1
codes.	1
A	1
definition	1
of	1
felonies	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
seas	1
is	1
evidently	1
requisite.	1
Felony	1
is	1
a	1
term	1
of	1
loose	1
signification,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
law	1
of	1
England;	1
and	1
of	1
various	1
import	1
in	1
the	1
statute	1
law	1
of	1
that	1
kingdom.	1
But	1
neither	1
the	1
common	1
nor	1
the	1
statute	1
law	1
of	1
that,	1
or	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
nation,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
standard	1
for	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
this,	1
unless	1
previously	1
made	1
its	1
own	1
by	1
legislative	1
adoption.	1
The	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
term,	1
as	1
defined	1
in	1
the	1
codes	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
impracticable	1
as	1
the	1
former	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
dishonorable	1
and	1
illegitimate	1
guide.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
any	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
States;	1
and	1
varies	1
in	1
each	1
with	1
every	1
revision	1
of	1
its	1
criminal	1
laws.	1
For	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
certainty	1
and	1
uniformity,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
defining	1
felonies	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
was	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
necessary	1
and	1
proper.	1
The	1
regulation	1
of	1
foreign	1
commerce,	1
having	1
fallen	1
within	1
several	1
views	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
of	1
this	1
subject,	1
has	1
been	1
too	1
fully	1
discussed	1
to	1
need	1
additional	1
proofs	1
here	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
properly	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
administration.	1
It	1
were	1
doubtless	1
to	1
be	1
wished,	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
prohibiting	1
the	1
importation	1
of	1
slaves	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
postponed	1
until	1
the	1
year	1
1808,	1
or	1
rather	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
suffered	1
to	1
have	1
immediate	1
operation.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
difficult	1
to	1
account,	1
either	1
for	1
this	1
restriction	1
on	1
the	1
general	1
government,	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
whole	1
clause	1
is	1
expressed.	1
It	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
point	1
gained	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
humanity,	1
that	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
twenty	1
years	1
may	1
terminate	1
forever,	1
within	1
these	1
States,	1
a	1
traffic	1
which	1
has	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
so	1
loudly	1
upbraided	1
the	1
barbarism	1
of	1
modern	1
policy;	1
that	1
within	1
that	1
period,	1
it	1
will	1
receive	1
a	1
considerable	1
discouragement	1
from	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
totally	1
abolished,	1
by	1
a	1
concurrence	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
States	1
which	1
continue	1
the	1
unnatural	1
traffic,	1
in	1
the	1
prohibitory	1
example	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
by	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
Happy	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
Africans,	1
if	1
an	1
equal	1
prospect	1
lay	1
before	1
them	1
of	1
being	1
redeemed	1
from	1
the	1
oppressions	1
of	1
their	1
European	1
brethren!	1
Attempts	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
pervert	1
this	1
clause	1
into	1
an	1
objection	1
against	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
by	1
representing	1
it	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
as	1
a	1
criminal	1
toleration	1
of	1
an	1
illicit	1
practice,	1
and	1
on	1
another	1
as	1
calculated	1
to	1
prevent	1
voluntary	1
and	1
beneficial	1
emigrations	1
from	1
Europe	1
to	1
America.	1
I	1
mention	1
these	1
misconstructions,	1
not	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
an	1
answer,	1
for	1
they	1
deserve	1
none,	1
but	1
as	1
specimens	1
of	1
the	1
manner	1
and	1
spirit	1
in	1
which	1
some	1
have	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
conduct	1
their	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
proposed	1
government.	1
The	1
powers	1
included	1
in	1
the	1
THIRD	1
class	1
are	1
those	1
which	1
provide	1
for	1
the	1
harmony	1
and	1
proper	1
intercourse	1
among	1
the	1
States.	1
Under	1
this	1
head	1
might	1
be	1
included	1
the	1
particular	1
restraints	1
imposed	1
on	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
and	1
certain	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
department;	1
but	1
the	1
former	1
are	1
reserved	1
for	1
a	1
distinct	1
class,	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
will	1
be	1
particularly	1
examined	1
when	1
we	1
arrive	1
at	1
the	1
structure	1
and	1
organization	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
I	1
shall	1
confine	1
myself	1
to	1
a	1
cursory	1
review	1
of	1
the	1
remaining	1
powers	1
comprehended	1
under	1
this	1
third	1
description,	1
to	1
wit:	1
to	1
regulate	1
commerce	1
among	1
the	1
several	1
States	1
and	1
the	1
Indian	1
tribes;	1
to	1
coin	1
money,	1
regulate	1
the	1
value	1
thereof,	1
and	1
of	1
foreign	1
coin;	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
counterfeiting	1
the	1
current	1
coin	1
and	1
secureties	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States;	1
to	1
fix	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
weights	1
and	1
measures;	1
to	1
establish	1
a	1
uniform	1
rule	1
of	1
naturalization,	1
and	1
uniform	1
laws	1
of	1
bankruptcy,	1
to	1
prescribe	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
public	1
acts,	1
records,	1
and	1
judicial	1
proceedings	1
of	1
each	1
State	1
shall	1
be	1
proved,	1
and	1
the	1
effect	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
in	1
other	1
States;	1
and	1
to	1
establish	1
post	1
offices	1
and	1
post	1
roads.	1
The	1
defect	1
of	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
existing	1
Confederacy	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
commerce	1
between	1
its	1
several	1
members,	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
clearly	1
pointed	1
out	1
by	1
experience.	1
To	1
the	1
proofs	1
and	1
remarks	1
which	1
former	1
papers	1
have	1
brought	1
into	1
view	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
added	1
that	1
without	1
this	1
supplemental	1
provision,	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
essential	1
power	1
of	1
regulating	1
foreign	1
commerce	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
incomplete	1
and	1
ineffectual.	1
A	1
very	1
material	1
object	1
of	1
this	1
power	1
was	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
which	1
import	1
and	1
export	1
through	1
other	1
States,	1
from	1
the	1
improper	1
contributions	1
levied	1
on	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
latter.	1
Were	1
these	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
trade	1
between	1
State	1
and	1
State,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
foreseen	1
that	1
ways	1
would	1
be	1
found	1
out	1
to	1
load	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
import	1
and	1
export,	1
during	1
the	1
passage	1
through	1
their	1
jurisdiction,	1
with	1
duties	1
which	1
would	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
makers	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
and	1
the	1
consumers	1
of	1
the	1
former.	1
We	1
may	1
be	1
assured	1
by	1
past	1
experience,	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
practice	1
would	1
be	1
introduced	1
by	1
future	1
contrivances;	1
and	1
both	1
by	1
that	1
and	1
a	1
common	1
knowledge	1
of	1
human	1
affairs,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
nourish	1
unceasing	1
animosities,	1
and	1
not	1
improbably	1
terminate	1
in	1
serious	1
interruptions	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
tranquillity.	1
To	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
view	1
the	1
question	1
through	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
passion	1
or	1
of	1
interest,	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
the	1
commercial	1
States	1
to	1
collect,	1
in	1
any	1
form,	1
an	1
indirect	1
revenue	1
from	1
their	1
uncommercial	1
neighbors,	1
must	1
appear	1
not	1
less	1
impolitic	1
than	1
it	1
is	1
unfair;	1
since	1
it	1
would	1
stimulate	1
the	1
injured	1
party,	1
by	1
resentment	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
interest,	1
to	1
resort	1
to	1
less	1
convenient	1
channels	1
for	1
their	1
foreign	1
trade.	1
But	1
the	1
mild	1
voice	1
of	1
reason,	1
pleading	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
an	1
enlarged	1
and	1
permanent	1
interest,	1
is	1
but	1
too	1
often	1
drowned,	1
before	1
public	1
bodies	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
individuals,	1
by	1
the	1
clamors	1
of	1
an	1
impatient	1
avidity	1
for	1
immediate	1
and	1
immoderate	1
gain.	1
The	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
superintending	1
authority	1
over	1
the	1
reciprocal	1
trade	1
of	1
confederated	1
States,	1
has	1
been	1
illustrated	1
by	1
other	1
examples	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
our	1
own.	1
In	1
Switzerland,	1
where	1
the	1
Union	1
is	1
so	1
very	1
slight,	1
each	1
canton	1
is	1
obliged	1
to	1
allow	1
to	1
merchandises	1
a	1
passage	1
through	1
its	1
jurisdiction	1
into	1
other	1
cantons,	1
without	1
an	1
augmentation	1
of	1
the	1
tolls.	1
In	1
Germany	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
empire,	1
that	1
the	1
princes	1
and	1
states	1
shall	1
not	1
lay	1
tolls	1
or	1
customs	1
on	1
bridges,	1
rivers,	1
or	1
passages,	1
without	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
emperor	1
and	1
the	1
diet;	1
though	1
it	1
appears	1
from	1
a	1
quotation	1
in	1
an	1
antecedent	1
paper,	1
that	1
the	1
practice	1
in	1
this,	1
as	1
in	1
many	1
other	1
instances	1
in	1
that	1
confederacy,	1
has	1
not	1
followed	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
has	1
produced	1
there	1
the	1
mischiefs	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
foreseen	1
here.	1
Among	1
the	1
restraints	1
imposed	1
by	1
the	1
Union	1
of	1
the	1
Netherlands	1
on	1
its	1
members,	1
one	1
is,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
establish	1
imposts	1
disadvantageous	1
to	1
their	1
neighbors,	1
without	1
the	1
general	1
permission.	1
The	1
regulation	1
of	1
commerce	1
with	1
the	1
Indian	1
tribes	1
is	1
very	1
properly	1
unfettered	1
from	1
two	1
limitations	1
in	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation,	1
which	1
render	1
the	1
provision	1
obscure	1
and	1
contradictory.	1
The	1
power	1
is	1
there	1
restrained	1
to	1
Indians,	1
not	1
members	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
violate	1
or	1
infringe	1
the	1
legislative	1
right	1
of	1
any	1
State	1
within	1
its	1
own	1
limits.	1
What	1
description	1
of	1
Indians	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
deemed	1
members	1
of	1
a	1
State,	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
settled,	1
and	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
frequent	1
perplexity	1
and	1
contention	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
councils.	1
And	1
how	1
the	1
trade	1
with	1
Indians,	1
though	1
not	1
members	1
of	1
a	1
State,	1
yet	1
residing	1
within	1
its	1
legislative	1
jurisdiction,	1
can	1
be	1
regulated	1
by	1
an	1
external	1
authority,	1
without	1
so	1
far	1
intruding	1
on	1
the	1
internal	1
rights	1
of	1
legislation,	1
is	1
absolutely	1
incomprehensible.	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
case	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation	1
have	1
inconsiderately	1
endeavored	1
to	1
accomplish	1
impossibilities;	1
to	1
reconcile	1
a	1
partial	1
sovereignty	1
in	1
the	1
Union,	1
with	1
complete	1
sovereignty	1
in	1
the	1
States;	1
to	1
subvert	1
a	1
mathematical	1
axiom,	1
by	1
taking	1
away	1
a	1
part,	1
and	1
letting	1
the	1
whole	1
remain.	1
All	1
that	1
need	1
be	1
remarked	1
on	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
coin	1
money,	1
regulate	1
the	1
value	1
thereof,	1
and	1
of	1
foreign	1
coin,	1
is,	1
that	1
by	1
providing	1
for	1
this	1
last	1
case,	1
the	1
Constitution	1
has	1
supplied	1
a	1
material	1
omission	1
in	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation.	1
The	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
existing	1
Congress	1
is	1
restrained	1
to	1
the	1
regulation	1
of	1
coin	1
STRUCK	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
authority,	1
or	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
respective	1
States.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
seen	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
the	1
proposed	1
uniformity	1
in	1
the	1
VALUE	1
of	1
the	1
current	1
coin	1
might	1
be	1
destroyed	1
by	1
subjecting	1
that	1
of	1
foreign	1
coin	1
to	1
the	1
different	1
regulations	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
States.	1
The	1
punishment	1
of	1
counterfeiting	1
the	1
public	1
securities,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
current	1
coin,	1
is	1
submitted	1
of	1
course	1
to	1
that	1
authority	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
both.	1
The	1
regulation	1
of	1
weights	1
and	1
measures	1
is	1
transferred	1
from	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation,	1
and	1
is	1
founded	1
on	1
like	1
considerations	1
with	1
the	1
preceding	1
power	1
of	1
regulating	1
coin.	1
The	1
dissimilarity	1
in	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
naturalization	1
has	1
long	1
been	1
remarked	1
as	1
a	1
fault	1
in	1
our	1
system,	1
and	1
as	1
laying	1
a	1
foundation	1
for	1
intricate	1
and	1
delicate	1
questions.	1
In	1
the	1
fourth	1
article	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation,	1
it	1
is	1
declared	1
"that	1
the	1
FREE	1
INHABITANTS	1
of	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
States,	1
paupers,	1
vagabonds,	1
and	1
fugitives	1
from	1
justice,	1
excepted,	1
shall	1
be	1
entitled	1
to	1
all	1
privileges	1
and	1
immunities	1
of	1
FREE	1
CITIZENS	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
States;	1
and	1
THE	1
PEOPLE	1
of	1
each	1
State	1
shall,	1
in	1
every	1
other,	1
enjoy	1
all	1
the	1
privileges	1
of	1
trade	1
and	1
commerce,"	1
etc.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
confusion	1
of	1
language	1
here,	1
which	1
is	1
remarkable.	1
Why	1
the	1
terms	1
FREE	1
INHABITANTS	1
are	1
used	1
in	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
article,	1
FREE	1
CITIZENS	1
in	1
another,	1
and	1
PEOPLE	1
in	1
another;	1
or	1
what	1
was	1
meant	1
by	1
superadding	1
to	1
"all	1
privileges	1
and	1
immunities	1
of	1
free	1
citizens,"	1
"all	1
the	1
privileges	1
of	1
trade	1
and	1
commerce,"	1
cannot	1
easily	1
be	1
determined.	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
construction	1
scarcely	1
avoidable,	1
however,	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
come	1
under	1
the	1
denomination	1
of	1
FREE	1
INHABITANTS	1
of	1
a	1
State,	1
although	1
not	1
citizens	1
of	1
such	1
State,	1
are	1
entitled,	1
in	1
every	1
other	1
State,	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
privileges	1
of	1
FREE	1
CITIZENS	1
of	1
the	1
latter;	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
greater	1
privileges	1
than	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
entitled	1
to	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
State:	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
a	1
particular	1
State,	1
or	1
rather	1
every	1
State	1
is	1
laid	1
under	1
a	1
necessity,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
confer	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
citizenship	1
in	1
other	1
States	1
upon	1
any	1
whom	1
it	1
may	1
admit	1
to	1
such	1
rights	1
within	1
itself,	1
but	1
upon	1
any	1
whom	1
it	1
may	1
allow	1
to	1
become	1
inhabitants	1
within	1
its	1
jurisdiction.	1
But	1
were	1
an	1
exposition	1
of	1
the	1
term	1
"inhabitants"	1
to	1
be	1
admitted	1
which	1
would	1
confine	1
the	1
stipulated	1
privileges	1
to	1
citizens	1
alone,	1
the	1
difficulty	1
is	1
diminished	1
only,	1
not	1
removed.	1
The	1
very	1
improper	1
power	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
retained	1
by	1
each	1
State,	1
of	1
naturalizing	1
aliens	1
in	1
every	1
other	1
State.	1
In	1
one	1
State,	1
residence	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
term	1
confirms	1
all	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
citizenship:	1
in	1
another,	1
qualifications	1
of	1
greater	1
importance	1
are	1
required.	1
An	1
alien,	1
therefore,	1
legally	1
incapacitated	1
for	1
certain	1
rights	1
in	1
the	1
latter,	1
may,	1
by	1
previous	1
residence	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
former,	1
elude	1
his	1
incapacity;	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
one	1
State	1
be	1
preposterously	1
rendered	1
paramount	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
another,	1
within	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
We	1
owe	1
it	1
to	1
mere	1
casualty,	1
that	1
very	1
serious	1
embarrassments	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
have	1
been	1
hitherto	1
escaped.	1
By	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
several	1
States,	1
certain	1
descriptions	1
of	1
aliens,	1
who	1
had	1
rendered	1
themselves	1
obnoxious,	1
were	1
laid	1
under	1
interdicts	1
inconsistent	1
not	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
citizenship	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
residence.	1
What	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
consequence,	1
if	1
such	1
persons,	1
by	1
residence	1
or	1
otherwise,	1
had	1
acquired	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
citizens	1
under	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
another	1
State,	1
and	1
then	1
asserted	1
their	1
rights	1
as	1
such,	1
both	1
to	1
residence	1
and	1
citizenship,	1
within	1
the	1
State	1
proscribing	1
them?	1
Whatever	1
the	1
legal	1
consequences	1
might	1
have	1
been,	1
other	1
consequences	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
resulted,	1
of	1
too	1
serious	1
a	1
nature	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
provided	1
against.	1
The	1
new	1
Constitution	1
has	1
accordingly,	1
with	1
great	1
propriety,	1
made	1
provision	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
others	1
proceeding	1
from	1
the	1
defect	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation	1
on	1
this	1
head,	1
by	1
authorizing	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
to	1
establish	1
a	1
uniform	1
rule	1
of	1
naturalization	1
throughout	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
establishing	1
uniform	1
laws	1
of	1
bankruptcy	1
is	1
so	1
intimately	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
regulation	1
of	1
commerce,	1
and	1
will	1
prevent	1
so	1
many	1
frauds	1
where	1
the	1
parties	1
or	1
their	1
property	1
may	1
lie	1
or	1
be	1
removed	1
into	1
different	1
States,	1
that	1
the	1
expediency	1
of	1
it	1
seems	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
drawn	1
into	1
question.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
prescribing	1
by	1
general	1
laws,	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
public	1
acts,	1
records	1
and	1
judicial	1
proceedings	1
of	1
each	1
State	1
shall	1
be	1
proved,	1
and	1
the	1
effect	1
they	1
shall	1
have	1
in	1
other	1
States,	1
is	1
an	1
evident	1
and	1
valuable	1
improvement	1
on	1
the	1
clause	1
relating	1
to	1
this	1
subject	1
in	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation.	1
The	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
is	1
extremely	1
indeterminate,	1
and	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
little	1
importance	1
under	1
any	1
interpretation	1
which	1
it	1
will	1
bear.	1
The	1
power	1
here	1
established	1
may	1
be	1
rendered	1
a	1
very	1
convenient	1
instrument	1
of	1
justice,	1
and	1
be	1
particularly	1
beneficial	1
on	1
the	1
borders	1
of	1
contiguous	1
States,	1
where	1
the	1
effects	1
liable	1
to	1
justice	1
may	1
be	1
suddenly	1
and	1
secretly	1
translated,	1
in	1
any	1
stage	1
of	1
the	1
process,	1
within	1
a	1
foreign	1
jurisdiction.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
establishing	1
post	1
roads	1
must,	1
in	1
every	1
view,	1
be	1
a	1
harmless	1
power,	1
and	1
may,	1
perhaps,	1
by	1
judicious	1
management,	1
become	1
productive	1
of	1
great	1
public	1
conveniency.	1
Nothing	1
which	1
tends	1
to	1
facilitate	1
the	1
intercourse	1
between	1
the	1
States	1
can	1
be	1
deemed	1
unworthy	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
care.	1

by	1

authors	1

the	1

"The	1

of	1
this	1

will	1
scarcely	1
be	1
questioned.	1
The	1
copyright	1
of	1

been	1
solemnly	1
adjudged,	1
in	1

to	1

The	1

with	1
equal	1

to	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1

The	1

fully	1
coincides	1
in	1
both	1
cases	1
with	1
the	1
claims	1
of	1
individuals.	1
The	1

cannot	1
separately	1

either	1
of	1

"The	1

It	1
is	1
a	1
power	1
exercised	1
by	1
every	1

I	1
might	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
by	1
virtue	1
of	1
its	1
general	1
supremacy.	1
Without	1
it,	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
public	1
authority	1
might	1
be	1
insulted	1

its	1

a	1

on	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

in	1
the	1

an	1

influence,	1
equally	1
dishonorable	1
to	1
the	1
government	1

dissatisfactory	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
members	1
of	1
the	1

This	1
consideration	1
has	1
the	1
more	1
weight,	1
as	1
the	1
gradual	1
accumulation	1
of	1
public	1
improvements	1
at	1
the	1
stationary	1
residence	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
would	1
be	1
both	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
public	1
pledge	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
State,	1
and	1
would	1
create	1
so	1
many	1
obstacles	1
to	1
a	1
removal	1
of	1
the	1

as	1
still	1
further	1
to	1
abridge	1
its	1
necessary	1
independence.	1
The	1
extent	1
of	1
this	1
federal	1
district	1
is	1
sufficiently	1
circumscribed	1
to	1
satisfy	1
every	1
jealousy	1
of	1
an	1
opposite	1
nature.	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
appropriated	1

this	1

the	1

forts,	1
magazines,	1

established	1

not	1

evident.	1
The	1
public	1
money	1
expended	1
on	1
such	1
places,	1
and	1
the	1
public	1
property	1
deposited	1
in	1

that	1

should	1

exempt	1

objections	1

are	1
here	1

obviated,	1

the	1

of	1
republican	1
members,	1
the	1

government	1
ought	1
clearly	1
to	1
possess	1
authority	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
system	1
against	1
aristocratic	1
or	1
monarchial	1
innovations.	1
The	1
more	1
intimate	1

nature	1

under	1
which	1
the	1

should	1

is	1
deposited	1

adapted	1

coalition	1
of	1
any	1
sort,	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
kindred	1
nature.	1
"As	1
the	1
confederate	1
republic	1
of	1
Germany,"	1
says	1
Montesquieu,	1
"consists	1
of	1
free	1
cities	1
and	1
petty	1
states,	1
subject	1
to	1
different	1
princes,	1
experience	1
shows	1
us	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
imperfect	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
Holland	1
and	1
Switzerland.	1
"	1
"Greece	1
was	1
undone,"	1
he	1
adds,	1
"as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Macedon	1
obtained	1
a	1
seat	1
among	1
the	1
Amphictyons.	1
"	1
In	1
the	1
latter	1
case,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
the	1
disproportionate	1
force,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
monarchical	1
form,	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
confederate,	1
had	1
its	1
share	1
of	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
events.	1
It	1
may	1
possibly	1
be	1
asked,	1
what	1
need	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
precaution,	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
become	1
a	1
pretext	1
for	1
alterations	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
without	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
themselves.	1
These	1
questions	1
admit	1
of	1
ready	1
answers.	1
If	1
the	1
interposition	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
needed,	1
the	1
provision	1
for	1
such	1
an	1
event	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
harmless	1
superfluity	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
But	1
who	1
can	1
say	1
what	1
experiments	1
may	1
be	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
caprice	1
of	1
particular	1
States,	1
by	1
the	1
ambition	1
of	1
enterprising	1
leaders,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
intrigues	1
and	1
influence	1
of	1
foreign	1
powers?	1
To	1
the	1
second	1
question	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
answered,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
should	1
interpose	1
by	1
virtue	1
of	1
this	1
constitutional	1
authority,	1
it	1
will	1
be,	1
of	1
course,	1
bound	1
to	1
pursue	1
the	1
authority.	1
But	1
the	1
authority	1
extends	1
no	1
further	1
than	1
to	1
a	1
GUARANTY	1
of	1
a	1
republican	1
form	1
of	1
government,	1
which	1
supposes	1
a	1
pre-existing	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
form	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
guaranteed.	1
As	1
long,	1
therefore,	1
as	1
the	1
existing	1
republican	1
forms	1
are	1
continued	1
by	1
the	1
States,	1
they	1
are	1
guaranteed	1
by	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution.	1
Whenever	1
the	1
States	1
may	1
choose	1
to	1
substitute	1
other	1
republican	1
forms,	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
to	1
claim	1
the	1
federal	1
guaranty	1
for	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
only	1
restriction	1
imposed	1
on	1
them	1
is,	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
exchange	1
republican	1
for	1
antirepublican	1
Constitutions;	1
a	1
restriction	1
which,	1
it	1
is	1
presumed,	1
will	1
hardly	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
grievance.	1
A	1
protection	1
against	1
invasion	1
is	1
due	1
from	1
every	1
society	1
to	1
the	1
parts	1
composing	1
it.	1
The	1
latitude	1
of	1
the	1
expression	1
here	1
used	1
seems	1
to	1
secure	1
each	1
State,	1
not	1
only	1
against	1
foreign	1
hostility,	1
but	1
against	1
ambitious	1
or	1
vindictive	1
enterprises	1
of	1
its	1
more	1
powerful	1
neighbors.	1
The	1
history,	1
both	1
of	1
ancient	1
and	1
modern	1
confederacies,	1
proves	1
that	1
the	1
weaker	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
union	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
insensible	1
to	1
the	1
policy	1
of	1
this	1
article.	1
Protection	1
against	1
domestic	1
violence	1
is	1
added	1
with	1
equal	1
propriety.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
remarked,	1
that	1
even	1
among	1
the	1
Swiss	1
cantons,	1
which,	1
properly	1
speaking,	1
are	1
not	1
under	1
one	1
government,	1
provision	1
is	1
made	1
for	1
this	1
object;	1
and	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
that	1
league	1
informs	1
us	1
that	1
mutual	1
aid	1
is	1
frequently	1
claimed	1
and	1
afforded;	1
and	1
as	1
well	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
democratic,	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
cantons.	1
A	1
recent	1
and	1
well-known	1
event	1
among	1
ourselves	1
has	1
warned	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
prepared	1
for	1
emergencies	1
of	1
a	1
like	1
nature.	1
At	1
first	1
view,	1
it	1
might	1
seem	1
not	1
to	1
square	1
with	1
the	1
republican	1
theory,	1
to	1
suppose,	1
either	1
that	1
a	1
majority	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
right,	1
or	1
that	1
a	1
minority	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
force,	1
to	1
subvert	1
a	1
government;	1
and	1
consequently,	1
that	1
the	1
federal	1
interposition	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
required,	1
but	1
when	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
improper.	1
But	1
theoretic	1
reasoning,	1
in	1
this	1
as	1
in	1
most	1
other	1
cases,	1
must	1
be	1
qualified	1
by	1
the	1
lessons	1
of	1
practice.	1
Why	1
may	1
not	1
illicit	1
combinations,	1
for	1
purposes	1
of	1
violence,	1
be	1
formed	1
as	1
well	1
by	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
a	1
State,	1
especially	1
a	1
small	1
State	1
as	1
by	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
a	1
county,	1
or	1
a	1
district	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
State;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
ought,	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
case,	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
local	1
magistracy,	1
ought	1
not	1
the	1
federal	1
authority,	1
in	1
the	1
former,	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
State	1
authority?	1
Besides,	1
there	1
are	1
certain	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
interwoven	1
with	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution,	1
that	1
a	1
violent	1
blow	1
cannot	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
without	1
communicating	1
the	1
wound	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
Insurrections	1
in	1
a	1
State	1
will	1
rarely	1
induce	1
a	1
federal	1
interposition,	1
unless	1
the	1
number	1
concerned	1
in	1
them	1
bear	1
some	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
government.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
better	1
that	1
the	1
violence	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
should	1
be	1
repressed	1
by	1
the	1
superintending	1
power,	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
majority	1
should	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
maintain	1
their	1
cause	1
by	1
a	1
bloody	1
and	1
obstinate	1
contest.	1
The	1
existence	1
of	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
interpose,	1
will	1
generally	1
prevent	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
exerting	1
it.	1
Is	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
force	1
and	1
right	1
are	1
necessarily	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
side	1
in	1
republican	1
governments?	1
May	1
not	1
the	1
minor	1
party	1
possess	1
such	1
a	1
superiority	1
of	1
pecuniary	1
resources,	1
of	1
military	1
talents	1
and	1
experience,	1
or	1
of	1
secret	1
succors	1
from	1
foreign	1
powers,	1
as	1
will	1
render	1
it	1
superior	1
also	1
in	1
an	1
appeal	1
to	1
the	1
sword?	1
May	1
not	1
a	1
more	1
compact	1
and	1
advantageous	1
position	1
turn	1
the	1
scale	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
side,	1
against	1
a	1
superior	1
number	1
so	1
situated	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
less	1
capable	1
of	1
a	1
prompt	1
and	1
collected	1
exertion	1
of	1
its	1
strength?	1
Nothing	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
chimerical	1
than	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
trial	1
of	1
actual	1
force,	1
victory	1
may	1
be	1
calculated	1
by	1
the	1
rules	1
which	1
prevail	1
in	1
a	1
census	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants,	1
or	1
which	1
determine	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
an	1
election!	1
May	1
it	1
not	1
happen,	1
in	1
fine,	1
that	1
the	1
minority	1
of	1
CITIZENS	1
may	1
become	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
PERSONS,	1
by	1
the	1
accession	1
of	1
alien	1
residents,	1
of	1
a	1
casual	1
concourse	1
of	1
adventurers,	1
or	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
has	1
not	1
admitted	1
to	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
suffrage?	1
I	1
take	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
an	1
unhappy	1
species	1
of	1
population	1
abounding	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
who,	1
during	1
the	1
calm	1
of	1
regular	1
government,	1
are	1
sunk	1
below	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
men;	1
but	1
who,	1
in	1
the	1
tempestuous	1
scenes	1
of	1
civil	1
violence,	1
may	1
emerge	1
into	1
the	1
human	1
character,	1
and	1
give	1
a	1
superiority	1
of	1
strength	1
to	1
any	1
party	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
may	1
associate	1
themselves.	1
In	1
cases	1
where	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
doubtful	1
on	1
which	1
side	1
justice	1
lies,	1
what	1
better	1
umpires	1
could	1
be	1
desired	1
by	1
two	1
violent	1
factions,	1
flying	1
to	1
arms,	1
and	1
tearing	1
a	1
State	1
to	1
pieces,	1
than	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
confederate	1
States,	1
not	1
heated	1
by	1
the	1
local	1
flame?	1
To	1
the	1
impartiality	1
of	1
judges,	1
they	1
would	1
unite	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
friends.	1
Happy	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
if	1
such	1
a	1
remedy	1
for	1
its	1
infirmities	1
could	1
be	1
enjoyed	1
by	1
all	1
free	1
governments;	1
if	1
a	1
project	1
equally	1
effectual	1
could	1
be	1
established	1
for	1
the	1
universal	1
peace	1
of	1
mankind!	1
Should	1
it	1
be	1
asked,	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
redress	1
for	1
an	1
insurrection	1
pervading	1
all	1
the	1
States,	1
and	1
comprising	1
a	1
superiority	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
force,	1
though	1
not	1
a	1
constitutional	1
right?	1
the	1
answer	1
must	1
be,	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
case,	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
without	1
the	1
compass	1
of	1
human	1
remedies,	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
fortunately	1
not	1
within	1
the	1
compass	1
of	1
human	1
probability;	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sufficient	1
recommendation	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution,	1
that	1
it	1
diminishes	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
a	1
calamity	1
for	1
which	1
no	1
possible	1
constitution	1
can	1
provide	1
a	1
cure.	1
Among	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
a	1
confederate	1
republic	1
enumerated	1
by	1
Montesquieu,	1
an	1
important	1
one	1
is,	1
"that	1
should	1
a	1
popular	1
insurrection	1
happen	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
the	1
others	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
quell	1
it.	1
Should	1
abuses	1
creep	1
into	1
one	1
part,	1
they	1
are	1
reformed	1
by	1
those	1
that	1
remain	1
sound.	1
"7.	1
"To	1
consider	1
all	1
debts	1
contracted,	1
and	1
engagements	1
entered	1
into,	1
before	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
this	1
Constitution,	1
as	1
being	1
no	1
less	1
valid	1
against	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
under	1
this	1
Constitution,	1
than	1
under	1
the	1

"This	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
declaratory	1
proposition;	1

may	1
have	1
been	1
inserted,	1
among	1
other	1
reasons,	1
for	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
the	1
foreign	1
creditors	1
of	1
the	1
United	1

doctrine,	1
that	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
political	1
form	1
of	1
civil	1
society	1
has	1
the	1
magical	1
effect	1
of	1
dissolving	1
its	1
moral	1
obligations.	1
Among	1
the	1
lesser	1
criticisms	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
exercised	1
on	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
remarked	1
that	1
the	1
validity	1
of	1
engagements	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
asserted	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
against	1
them;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
usually	1
characterizes	1
little	1
critics,	1
the	1
omission	1
has	1
been	1
transformed	1
and	1
magnified	1
into	1
a	1
plot	1
against	1
the	1
national	1
rights.	1
The	1
authors	1
of	1
this	1
discovery	1
may	1
be	1
told,	1
what	1
few	1
others	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
informed	1
of,	1
that	1
as	1
engagements	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
nature	1
reciprocal,	1
an	1
assertion	1
of	1
their	1
validity	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
necessarily	1
involves	1
a	1
validity	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side;	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
article	1
is	1
merely	1
declaratory,	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
principle	1
in	1
one	1
case	1
is	1
sufficient	1
for	1
every	1
case.	1
They	1
may	1
be	1
further	1
told,	1
that	1
every	1
constitution	1
must	1
limit	1
its	1
precautions	1
to	1
dangers	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
altogether	1
imaginary;	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
real	1
danger	1
can	1
exist	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
would	1
DARE,	1
with,	1
or	1
even	1
without,	1
this	1
constitutional	1
declaration	1
before	1
it,	1
to	1
remit	1
the	1
debts	1
justly	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
public,	1
on	1
the	1
pretext	1
here	1
condemned.	1
8.	1
"To	1
provide	1
for	1
amendments	1
to	1
be	1
ratified	1
by	1
three	1
fourths	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
under	1
two	1
exceptions	1
only.	1
"That	1
useful	1
alterations	1
will	1
be	1
suggested	1
by	1
experience,	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
foreseen.	1
It	1
was	1
requisite,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
a	1
mode	1
for	1
introducing	1
them	1
should	1
be	1
provided.	1
The	1
mode	1
preferred	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
stamped	1
with	1
every	1
mark	1
of	1
propriety.	1
It	1
guards	1
equally	1
against	1
that	1
extreme	1
facility,	1
which	1
would	1
render	1
the	1
Constitution	1
too	1
mutable;	1
and	1
that	1
extreme	1
difficulty,	1
which	1
might	1
perpetuate	1
its	1
discovered	1
faults.	1
It,	1
moreover,	1
equally	1
enables	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
to	1
originate	1
the	1
amendment	1
of	1
errors,	1
as	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
pointed	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
experience	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
other.	1
The	1
exception	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
equality	1
of	1
suffrage	1
in	1
the	1
Senate,	1
was	1
probably	1
meant	1
as	1
a	1
palladium	1
to	1
the	1
residuary	1
sovereignty	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
implied	1
and	1
secured	1
by	1
that	1
principle	1
of	1
representation	1
in	1
one	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature;	1
and	1
was	1
probably	1
insisted	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
States	1
particularly	1
attached	1
to	1
that	1
equality.	1
The	1
other	1
exception	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
admitted	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
considerations	1
which	1
produced	1
the	1
privilege	1
defended	1
by	1
it.	1
9.	1
"The	1
ratification	1
of	1
the	1
conventions	1
of	1
nine	1
States	1
shall	1
be	1
sufficient	1
for	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
this	1
Constitution	1
between	1
the	1
States,	1
ratifying	1
the	1
same.	1
"This	1
article	1
speaks	1
for	1
itself.	1
The	1
express	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
alone	1
could	1
give	1
due	1
validity	1
to	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
To	1
have	1
required	1

interests	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
to	1
the	1
caprice	1
or	1
corruption	1
of	1
a	1

member.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
marked	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
foresight	1
in	1
the	1
convention,	1
which	1
our	1
own	1
experience	1
would	1
have	1
rendered	1
inexcusable.	1
Two	1
questions	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
delicate	1
nature	1
present	1
themselves	1
on	1
this	1
occasion:	1
1.	1
On	1
what	1
principle	1
the	1
Confederation,	1
which	1
stands	1
in	1
the	1
solemn	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
compact	1
among	1
the	1
States,	1
can	1
be	1
superseded	1
without	1
the	1
unanimous	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
parties	1
to	1
it?	1
2.	1
What	1
relation	1
is	1
to	1
subsist	1
between	1
the	1
nine	1
or	1
more	1
States	1
ratifying	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
and	1
the	1
remaining	1
few	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
become	1
parties	1
to	1
it?	1
The	1
first	1
question	1
is	1
answered	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
recurring	1
to	1
the	1
absolute	1
necessity	1
of	1
the	1
case;	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
principle	1
of	1
self-preservation;	1
to	1
the	1
transcendent	1
law	1
of	1
nature	1
and	1
of	1
nature's	1
God,	1
which	1
declares	1
that	1
the	1
safety	1
and	1
happiness	1
of	1
society	1
are	1
the	1
objects	1
at	1
which	1
all	1
political	1
institutions	1
aim,	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
all	1
such	1
institutions	1
must	1
be	1
sacrificed.	1
PERHAPS,	1
also,	1
an	1
answer	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
without	1
searching	1
beyond	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
compact	1
itself.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
heretofore	1
noted	1
among	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
Confederation,	1
that	1
in	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
it	1
had	1
received	1
no	1
higher	1
sanction	1
than	1
a	1
mere	1
legislative	1
ratification.	1
The	1
principle	1
of	1
reciprocality	1
seems	1
to	1
require	1
that	1
its	1
obligation	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
States	1
should	1
be	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
standard.	1
A	1
compact	1
between	1
independent	1
sovereigns,	1
founded	1
on	1
ordinary	1
acts	1
of	1
legislative	1
authority,	1
can	1
pretend	1
to	1
no	1
higher	1
validity	1
than	1
a	1
league	1
or	1
treaty	1
between	1
the	1
parties.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
established	1
doctrine	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
treaties,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
articles	1
are	1
mutually	1
conditions	1
of	1
each	1
other;	1
that	1
a	1
breach	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
article	1
is	1
a	1
breach	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
treaty;	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
breach,	1
committed	1
by	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
parties,	1
absolves	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
authorizes	1
them,	1
if	1
they	1
please,	1
to	1
pronounce	1
the	1
compact	1
violated	1
and	1
void.	1
Should	1
it	1
unhappily	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
appeal	1
to	1
these	1
delicate	1
truths	1
for	1
a	1
justification	1
for	1
dispensing	1
with	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
particular	1
States	1
to	1
a	1
dissolution	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
pact,	1
will	1
not	1
the	1
complaining	1
parties	1
find	1
it	1
a	1
difficult	1
task	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
MULTIPLIED	1
and	1
IMPORTANT	1
infractions	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
confronted?	1
The	1
time	1
has	1
been	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
incumbent	1
on	1
us	1
all	1
to	1
veil	1
the	1
ideas	1
which	1
this	1
paragraph	1
exhibits.	1
The	1
scene	1
is	1
now	1
changed,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
part	1
which	1
the	1
same	1
motives	1
dictate.	1
The	1
second	1
question	1
is	1
not	1
less	1
delicate;	1
and	1
the	1
flattering	1
prospect	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
merely	1
hypothetical	1
forbids	1
an	1
overcurious	1
discussion	1
of	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
cases	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
itself.	1
In	1
general,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
observed,	1
that	1
although	1
no	1
political	1
relation	1
can	1
subsist	1
between	1
the	1
assenting	1
and	1
dissenting	1
States,	1
yet	1
the	1
moral	1
relations	1
will	1
remain	1
uncancelled.	1
The	1
claims	1
of	1
justice,	1
both	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
force,	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
fulfilled;	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
humanity	1
must	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
be	1
duly	1
and	1
mutually	1
respected;	1
whilst	1
considerations	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
interest,	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
endearing	1
scenes	1
which	1
are	1
past,	1
and	1
the	1
anticipation	1
of	1
a	1
speedy	1
triumph	1
over	1
the	1

A	1
FIFTH	1
class	1
of	1
provisions	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
authority	1
consists	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
restrictions	1
on	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States:1.	1
"No	1
State	1
shall	1
enter	1
into	1
any	1
treaty,	1
alliance,	1
or	1
confederation;	1
grant	1
letters	1
of	1
marque	1
and	1
reprisal;	1
coin	1
money;	1
emit	1
bills	1
of	1
credit;	1
make	1
any	1
thing	1
but	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
a	1
legal	1
tender	1
in	1
payment	1
of	1
debts;	1
pass	1
any	1
bill	1
of	1
attainder,	1
ex-post-facto	1
law,	1
or	1
law	1
impairing	1
the	1
obligation	1
of	1
contracts;	1
or	1
grant	1
any	1
title	1
of	1
nobility.	1
"The	1
prohibition	1
against	1
treaties,	1
alliances,	1
and	1
confederations	1
makes	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
existing	1
articles	1
of	1
Union;	1
and	1
for	1
reasons	1
which	1
need	1
no	1
explanation,	1
is	1
copied	1
into	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution.	1
The	1
prohibition	1
of	1
letters	1
of	1
marque	1
is	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
system,	1
but	1
is	1
somewhat	1
extended	1
in	1
the	1
new.	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
former,	1
letters	1
of	1
marque	1
could	1
be	1
granted	1
by	1
the	1
States	1
after	1
a	1
declaration	1
of	1
war;	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
latter,	1
these	1
licenses	1
must	1
be	1
obtained,	1
as	1
well	1
during	1
war	1
as	1
previous	1
to	1
its	1
declaration,	1
from	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
This	1
alteration	1
is	1
fully	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
uniformity	1
in	1
all	1
points	1
which	1
relate	1
to	1
foreign	1
powers;	1
and	1
of	1
immediate	1
responsibility	1
to	1
the	1
nation	1
in	1
all	1
those	1
for	1
whose	1
conduct	1
the	1
nation	1
itself	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
responsible.	1
The	1
right	1
of	1
coining	1
money,	1
which	1
is	1
here	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
States,	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
by	1
the	1
Confederation,	1
as	1
a	1
concurrent	1
right	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
Congress,	1
under	1
an	1
exception	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
exclusive	1
right	1
of	1
Congress	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
alloy	1
and	1
value.	1
In	1
this	1
instance,	1
also,	1
the	1
new	1
provision	1
is	1
an	1
improvement	1
on	1
the	1
old.	1
Whilst	1
the	1
alloy	1
and	1
value	1
depended	1
on	1
the	1
general	1
authority,	1
a	1
right	1
of	1
coinage	1
in	1
the	1
particular	1
States	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
other	1
effect	1
than	1
to	1
multiply	1
expensive	1
mints	1
and	1
diversify	1
the	1
forms	1
and	1
weights	1
of	1
the	1
circulating	1
pieces.	1
The	1
latter	1
inconveniency	1
defeats	1
one	1
purpose	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
power	1
was	1
originally	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
head;	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
former	1
might	1
prevent	1
an	1
inconvenient	1
remittance	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
to	1
the	1
central	1
mint	1
for	1
recoinage,	1
the	1
end	1
can	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
attained	1
by	1
local	1
mints	1
established	1
under	1
the	1
general	1
authority.	1
The	1
extension	1
of	1
the	1
prohibition	1
to	1
bills	1
of	1
credit	1
must	1
give	1
pleasure	1
to	1
every	1
citizen,	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
his	1
love	1
of	1
justice	1
and	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
springs	1
of	1
public	1
prosperity.	1
The	1
loss	1
which	1
America	1
has	1
sustained	1
since	1
the	1
peace,	1
from	1
the	1
pestilent	1
effects	1
of	1
paper	1
money	1
on	1
the	1
necessary	1
confidence	1
between	1
man	1
and	1
man,	1
on	1
the	1
necessary	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
councils,	1
on	1
the	1
industry	1
and	1
morals	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
republican	1
government,	1
constitutes	1
an	1
enormous	1
debt	1
against	1
the	1
States	1
chargeable	1
with	1
this	1
unadvised	1
measure,	1
which	1
must	1
long	1
remain	1
unsatisfied;	1
or	1
rather	1
an	1
accumulation	1
of	1
guilt,	1
which	1
can	1
be	1
expiated	1
no	1
otherwise	1
than	1
by	1
a	1
voluntary	1
sacrifice	1
on	1
the	1
altar	1
of	1
justice,	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
instrument	1
of	1
it.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
these	1
persuasive	1
considerations,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
observed,	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
reasons	1
which	1
show	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
denying	1
to	1
the	1
States	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
regulating	1
coin,	1
prove	1
with	1
equal	1
force	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
substitute	1
a	1
paper	1
medium	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
coin.	1
Had	1
every	1
State	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
its	1
coin,	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
as	1
many	1
different	1
currencies	1
as	1
States,	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
intercourse	1
among	1
them	1
would	1
be	1
impeded;	1
retrospective	1
alterations	1
in	1
its	1
value	1
might	1
be	1
made,	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
other	1
States	1
be	1
injured,	1
and	1
animosities	1
be	1
kindled	1
among	1
the	1
States	1
themselves.	1
The	1
subjects	1
of	1
foreign	1
powers	1
might	1
suffer	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
cause,	1
and	1
hence	1
the	1
Union	1
be	1
discredited	1
and	1
embroiled	1
by	1
the	1
indiscretion	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
member.	1
No	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
mischiefs	1
is	1
less	1
incident	1
to	1
a	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
States	1
to	1
emit	1
paper	1
money,	1
than	1
to	1
coin	1
gold	1
or	1
silver.	1
The	1
power	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
thing	1
but	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
a	1
tender	1
in	1
payment	1
of	1
debts,	1
is	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
the	1
States,	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
principle	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
issuing	1
a	1
paper	1
currency.	1
Bills	1
of	1
attainder,	1
ex-post-facto	1
laws,	1
and	1
laws	1
impairing	1
the	1
obligation	1
of	1
contracts,	1
are	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
social	1
compact,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
principle	1
of	1
sound	1
legislation.	1
The	1
two	1
former	1
are	1
expressly	1
prohibited	1
by	1
the	1
declarations	1
prefixed	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
prohibited	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
scope	1
of	1
these	1
fundamental	1
charters.	1
Our	1
own	1
experience	1
has	1
taught	1
us,	1
nevertheless,	1
that	1
additional	1
fences	1
against	1
these	1
dangers	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
omitted.	1
Very	1
properly,	1
therefore,	1
have	1
the	1
convention	1
added	1
this	1
constitutional	1
bulwark	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
personal	1
security	1
and	1
private	1
rights;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
deceived	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
not,	1
in	1
so	1
doing,	1
as	1
faithfully	1
consulted	1
the	1
genuine	1
sentiments	1
as	1
the	1
undoubted	1
interests	1
of	1
their	1
constituents.	1
The	1
sober	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
are	1
weary	1
of	1
the	1
fluctuating	1
policy	1
which	1
has	1
directed	1
the	1
public	1
councils.	1
They	1
have	1
seen	1
with	1
regret	1
and	1
indignation	1
that	1
sudden	1
changes	1
and	1
legislative	1
interferences,	1
in	1
cases	1
affecting	1
personal	1
rights,	1
become	1
jobs	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
enterprising	1
and	1
influential	1
speculators,	1
and	1
snares	1
to	1
the	1
more-industrious	1
and	1
less-informed	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
They	1
have	1
seen,	1
too,	1
that	1
one	1
legislative	1
interference	1
is	1
but	1
the	1
first	1
link	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
chain	1
of	1
repetitions,	1
every	1
subsequent	1
interference	1
being	1
naturally	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
the	1
preceding.	1
They	1
very	1
rightly	1
infer,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
some	1
thorough	1
reform	1
is	1
wanting,	1
which	1
will	1
banish	1
speculations	1
on	1
public	1
measures,	1
inspire	1
a	1
general	1
prudence	1
and	1
industry,	1
and	1
give	1
a	1
regular	1
course	1
to	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
society.	1
The	1
prohibition	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
titles	1
of	1
nobility	1
is	1
copied	1
from	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation	1
and	1
needs	1
no	1
comment.	1
2.	1
"No	1
State	1
shall,	1
without	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
Congress,	1
lay	1
any	1
imposts	1
or	1
duties	1
on	1
imports	1
or	1
exports,	1
except	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
for	1
executing	1
its	1
inspection	1
laws,	1
and	1
the	1
net	1
produce	1
of	1
all	1
duties	1
and	1
imposts	1
laid	1
by	1
any	1
State	1
on	1
imports	1
or	1
exports,	1
shall	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
treasury	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States;	1
and	1
all	1
such	1
laws	1
shall	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
revision	1
and	1
control	1
of	1
the	1
Congress.	1
No	1
State	1
shall,	1
without	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
Congress,	1
lay	1
any	1
duty	1
on	1
tonnage,	1
keep	1
troops	1
or	1
ships	1
of	1
war	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
peace,	1
enter	1
into	1
any	1
agreement	1
or	1
compact	1
with	1
another	1
State,	1
or	1
with	1
a	1
foreign	1
power,	1
or	1
engage	1
in	1
war	1
unless	1
actually	1
invaded,	1
or	1
in	1
such	1
imminent	1
danger	1
as	1
will	1
not	1
admit	1
of	1
delay.	1
"The	1
restraint	1
on	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
over	1
imports	1
and	1
exports	1
is	1
enforced	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
arguments	1
which	1
prove	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
submitting	1
the	1
regulation	1
of	1
trade	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
councils.	1
It	1
is	1
needless,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
remark	1
further	1
on	1
this	1
head,	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
restraint	1
is	1
qualified	1
seems	1
well	1
calculated	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
secure	1
to	1
the	1
States	1
a	1
reasonable	1
discretion	1
in	1
providing	1
for	1
the	1
conveniency	1
of	1
their	1
imports	1
and	1
exports,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
a	1
reasonable	1
check	1
against	1
the	1
abuse	1
of	1
this	1
discretion.	1
The	1
remaining	1
particulars	1
of	1
this	1
clause	1
fall	1
within	1
reasonings	1
which	1
are	1
either	1
so	1
obvious,	1
or	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
fully	1
developed,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
passed	1
over	1
without	1
remark.	1
The	1
SIXTH	1
and	1
last	1
class	1
consists	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
powers	1
and	1
provisions	1
by	1
which	1
efficacy	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rest.	1
1.	1
Of	1
these	1
the	1
first	1
is,	1
the	1
"power	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
laws	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
necessary	1
and	1
proper	1
for	1
carrying	1
into	1
execution	1
the	1
foregoing	1
powers,	1
and	1
all	1
other	1
powers	1
vested	1
by	1
this	1
Constitution	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
department	1
or	1
officer	1
thereof.	1
"Few	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
have	1
been	1
assailed	1
with	1
more	1
intemperance	1
than	1
this;	1
yet	1
on	1
a	1
fair	1
investigation	1
of	1
it,	1
no	1
part	1
can	1
appear	1
more	1
completely	1
invulnerable.	1
Without	1
the	1
SUBSTANCE	1
of	1
this	1
power,	1
the	1
whole	1
Constitution	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
dead	1
letter.	1
Those	1
who	1
object	1
to	1
the	1
article,	1
therefore,	1
as	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
can	1
only	1
mean	1
that	1
the	1
FORM	1
of	1
the	1
provision	1
is	1
improper.	1
But	1
have	1
they	1
considered	1
whether	1
a	1
better	1
form	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
substituted?	1
There	1
are	1
four	1
other	1
possible	1
methods	1
which	1
the	1
Constitution	1
might	1
have	1
taken	1
on	1
this	1
subject.	1
They	1
might	1
have	1
copied	1
the	1
second	1
article	1
of	1
the	1
existing	1
Confederation,	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
prohibited	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
any	1
power	1
not	1
EXPRESSLY	1
delegated;	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
attempted	1
a	1
positive	1
enumeration	1
of	1
the	1
powers	1
comprehended	1
under	1
the	1
general	1
terms	1
"necessary	1
and	1
proper";	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
attempted	1
a	1
negative	1
enumeration	1
of	1
them,	1
by	1
specifying	1
the	1
powers	1
excepted	1
from	1
the	1
general	1
definition;	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
altogether	1
silent	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
leaving	1
these	1
necessary	1
and	1
proper	1
powers	1
to	1
construction	1
and	1
inference.	1
Had	1
the	1
convention	1
taken	1
the	1
first	1
method	1
of	1
adopting	1
the	1
second	1
article	1
of	1
Confederation,	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
Congress	1
would	1
be	1
continually	1
exposed,	1
as	1
their	1
predecessors	1
have	1
been,	1
to	1
the	1
alternative	1
of	1
construing	1
the	1
term	1
"EXPRESSLY"	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
rigor,	1
as	1
to	1
disarm	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
all	1
real	1
authority	1
whatever,	1
or	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
latitude	1
as	1
to	1
destroy	1
altogether	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
restriction.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
easy	1
to	1
show,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
necessary,	1
that	1
no	1
important	1
power,	1
delegated	1
by	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation,	1
has	1
been	1
or	1
can	1
be	1
executed	1
by	1
Congress,	1
without	1
recurring	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
to	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
CONSTRUCTION	1
or	1
IMPLICATION.	1
As	1
the	1
powers	1
delegated	1
under	1
the	1
new	1
system	1
are	1
more	1
extensive,	1
the	1
government	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
administer	1
it	1
would	1
find	1
itself	1
still	1
more	1
distressed	1
with	1
the	1
alternative	1
of	1
betraying	1
the	1
public	1
interests	1
by	1
doing	1
nothing,	1
or	1
of	1
violating	1
the	1
Constitution	1
by	1
exercising	1
powers	1
indispensably	1
necessary	1
and	1
proper,	1
but,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
not	1
EXPRESSLY	1
granted.	1
Had	1
the	1
convention	1
attempted	1
a	1
positive	1
enumeration	1
of	1
the	1
powers	1
necessary	1
and	1
proper	1
for	1
carrying	1
their	1
other	1
powers	1
into	1
effect,	1
the	1
attempt	1
would	1
have	1
involved	1
a	1
complete	1
digest	1
of	1
laws	1
on	1
every	1
subject	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
Constitution	1
relates;	1
accommodated	1
too,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
existing	1
state	1
of	1
things,	1
but	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
possible	1
changes	1
which	1
futurity	1
may	1
produce;	1
for	1
in	1
every	1
new	1
application	1
of	1
a	1
general	1
power,	1
the	1
PARTICULAR	1
POWERS,	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
attaining	1
the	1
OBJECT	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
power,	1
must	1
always	1
necessarily	1
vary	1
with	1
that	1
object,	1
and	1
be	1
often	1
properly	1
varied	1
whilst	1
the	1
object	1
remains	1
the	1
same.	1
Had	1
they	1
attempted	1
to	1
enumerate	1
the	1
particular	1
powers	1
or	1
means	1
not	1
necessary	1
or	1
proper	1
for	1
carrying	1
the	1
general	1
powers	1
into	1
execution,	1
the	1
task	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
less	1
chimerical;	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
liable	1
to	1
this	1
further	1
objection,	1
that	1
every	1
defect	1
in	1
the	1
enumeration	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
equivalent	1
to	1
a	1
positive	1
grant	1
of	1
authority.	1
If,	1
to	1
avoid	1
this	1
consequence,	1
they	1
had	1
attempted	1
a	1
partial	1
enumeration	1
of	1
the	1
exceptions,	1
and	1
described	1
the	1
residue	1
by	1
the	1
general	1
terms,	1
NOT	1
NECESSARY	1
OR	1
PROPER,	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
happened	1
that	1
the	1
enumeration	1
would	1
comprehend	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
excepted	1
powers	1
only;	1
that	1
these	1
would	1
be	1
such	1
as	1
would	1
be	1
least	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
assumed	1
or	1
tolerated,	1
because	1
the	1
enumeration	1
would	1
of	1
course	1
select	1
such	1
as	1
would	1
be	1
least	1
necessary	1
or	1
proper;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
unnecessary	1
and	1
improper	1
powers	1
included	1
in	1
the	1
residuum,	1
would	1
be	1
less	1
forcibly	1
excepted,	1
than	1
if	1
no	1
partial	1
enumeration	1
had	1
been	1
made.	1
Had	1
the	1
Constitution	1
been	1
silent	1
on	1
this	1
head,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
particular	1
powers	1
requisite	1
as	1
means	1
of	1
executing	1
the	1
general	1
powers	1
would	1
have	1
resulted	1
to	1
the	1
government,	1
by	1
unavoidable	1
implication.	1
No	1
axiom	1
is	1
more	1
clearly	1
established	1
in	1
law,	1
or	1
in	1
reason,	1
than	1
that	1
wherever	1
the	1
end	1
is	1
required,	1
the	1
means	1
are	1
authorized;	1
wherever	1
a	1
general	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
a	1
thing	1
is	1
given,	1
every	1
particular	1
power	1
necessary	1
for	1
doing	1
it	1
is	1
included.	1
Had	1
this	1
last	1
method,	1
therefore,	1
been	1
pursued	1
by	1
the	1
convention,	1
every	1
objection	1
now	1
urged	1
against	1
their	1
plan	1
would	1
remain	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
plausibility;	1
and	1
the	1
real	1
inconveniency	1
would	1
be	1
incurred	1
of	1
not	1
removing	1
a	1
pretext	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
seized	1
on	1
critical	1
occasions	1
for	1
drawing	1
into	1
question	1
the	1
essential	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
asked	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
consequence,	1
in	1
case	1
the	1
Congress	1
shall	1
misconstrue	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
and	1
exercise	1
powers	1
not	1
warranted	1
by	1
its	1
true	1
meaning,	1
I	1
answer,	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
misconstrue	1
or	1
enlarge	1
any	1
other	1
power	1
vested	1
in	1
them;	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
general	1
power	1
had	1
been	1
reduced	1
to	1
particulars,	1
and	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
violated;	1
the	1
same,	1
in	1
short,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
should	1
violate	1
the	1
irrespective	1
constitutional	1
authorities.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
instance,	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
usurpation	1
will	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
executive	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments,	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
expound	1
and	1
give	1
effect	1
to	1
the	1
legislative	1
acts;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
resort	1
a	1
remedy	1
must	1
be	1
obtained	1
from	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
can,	1
by	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
more	1
faithful	1
representatives,	1
annul	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
usurpers.	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
that	1
this	1
ultimate	1
redress	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
confided	1
in	1
against	1
unconstitutional	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
for	1
this	1
plain	1
reason,	1
that	1
as	1
every	1
such	1
act	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
will	1
be	1
an	1
invasion	1
of	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
latter,	1
these	1
will	1
be	1
ever	1
ready	1
to	1
mark	1
the	1
innovation,	1
to	1
sound	1
the	1
alarm	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
exert	1
their	1
local	1
influence	1
in	1
effecting	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
federal	1
representatives.	1
There	1
being	1
no	1
such	1
intermediate	1
body	1
between	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
interested	1
in	1
watching	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
former,	1
violations	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
are	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
remain	1
unnoticed	1
and	1
unredressed.	1

"This	1
Constitution	1

the	1

thereof,	1

which	1
shall	1
be	1

in	1
every	1

shall	1
be	1
bound	1
thereby,	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
constitution	1
or	1
laws	1
of	1
any	1
State	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
notwithstanding.	1
"The	1
indiscreet	1
zeal	1
of	1
the	1
adversaries	1
to	1
the	1
Constitution	1
has	1
betrayed	1
them	1
into	1
an	1
attack	1
on	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
also,	1
without	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
evidently	1
and	1
radically	1
defective.	1
To	1
be	1
fully	1
sensible	1
of	1
this,	1
we	1
need	1
only	1
suppose	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
that	1
the	1
supremacy	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
complete	1
by	1
a	1
saving	1
clause	1
in	1
their	1
favor.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
as	1
these	1
constitutions	1
invest	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
with	1
absolute	1
sovereignty,	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
not	1
excepted	1
by	1
the	1
existing	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation,	1
all	1
the	1
authorities	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
exceed	1
those	1
enumerated	1
in	1
the	1
Confederation,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
annulled,	1
and	1
the	1
new	1
Congress	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
impotent	1
condition	1
with	1
their	1
predecessors.	1
In	1
the	1
next	1
place,	1
as	1
the	1
constitutions	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
expressly	1
and	1
fully	1
recognize	1
the	1
existing	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy,	1
an	1
express	1
saving	1
of	1
the	1
supremacy	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
would,	1
in	1
such	1
States,	1
have	1
brought	1
into	1
question	1
every	1
power	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution.	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
place,	1
as	1
the	1
constitutions	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
differ	1
much	1
from	1
each	1
other,	1
it	1
might	1
happen	1
that	1
a	1
treaty	1
or	1
national	1
law,	1
of	1
great	1
and	1
equal	1
importance	1
to	1
the	1
States,	1
would	1
interfere	1
with	1
some	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
other	1
constitutions,	1
and	1
would	1
consequently	1
be	1
valid	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
effect	1
in	1
others.	1
In	1
fine,	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
have	1
seen,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
a	1
system	1
of	1
government	1
founded	1
on	1
an	1
inversion	1
of	1
the	1
fundamental	1
principles	1
of	1
all	1
government;	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
society	1
every	1
where	1
subordinate	1
to	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
parts;	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
monster,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
head	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
members.	1
3.	1
"The	1
Senators	1
and	1
Representatives,	1
and	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
and	1
all	1
executive	1
and	1
judicial	1
officers,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
and	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
shall	1
be	1
bound	1
by	1
oath	1
or	1
affirmation	1
to	1
support	1
this	1
Constitution.	1
"It	1
has	1
been	1
asked	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
thought	1
necessary,	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
magistracy	1
should	1
be	1
bound	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution,	1
and	1
unnecessary	1
that	1
a	1
like	1
oath	1
should	1
be	1
imposed	1
on	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions.	1
Several	1
reasons	1
might	1
be	1
assigned	1
for	1
the	1
distinction.	1
I	1
content	1
myself	1
with	1
one,	1
which	1
is	1
obvious	1
and	1
conclusive.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
agency	1
in	1
carrying	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
into	1
effect.	1
The	1
members	1
and	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
will	1
have	1
an	1
essential	1
agency	1
in	1
giving	1
effect	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution.	1
The	1
election	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
and	1
Senate	1
will	1
depend,	1
in	1
all	1
cases,	1
on	1
the	1
legislatures	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States.	1
And	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
will	1
equally	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
authority	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance;	1
and	1
will,	1
probably,	1
forever	1
be	1
conducted	1
by	1
the	1
officers,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
laws,	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
4.	1
Among	1
the	1
provisions	1
for	1
giving	1
efficacy	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
powers	1
might	1
be	1
added	1
those	1
which	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
executive	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments:	1
but	1
as	1
these	1
are	1
reserved	1
for	1
particular	1
examination	1
in	1
another	1
place,	1
I	1
pass	1
them	1
over	1
in	1
this.	1
We	1
have	1
now	1
reviewed,	1
in	1
detail,	1
all	1
the	1
articles	1
composing	1
the	1
sum	1
or	1
quantity	1
of	1
power	1
delegated	1
by	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
and	1
are	1
brought	1
to	1
this	1
undeniable	1
conclusion,	1
that	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
is	1
unnecessary	1
or	1
improper	1
for	1
accomplishing	1
the	1
necessary	1
objects	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
The	1
question,	1
therefore,	1
whether	1
this	1
amount	1
of	1
power	1
shall	1
be	1
granted	1
or	1
not,	1
resolves	1
itself	1
into	1
another	1
question,	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
a	1
government	1
commensurate	1
to	1
the	1
exigencies	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
shall	1
be	1
established;	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
whether	1
the	1
Union	1
itself	1
shall	1
be	1
preserved.	1

MADISON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
New	1
York:	1
HAVING	1
shown	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
powers	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
is	1
unnecessary	1
or	1
improper,	1
the	1
next	1
question	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
is,	1
whether	1
the	1
whole	1
mass	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
be	1
dangerous	1
to	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
authority	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
States.	1
The	1
adversaries	1
to	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
instead	1
of	1
considering	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
what	1
degree	1
of	1
power	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
purposes	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
have	1
exhausted	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
secondary	1
inquiry	1
into	1
the	1
possible	1
consequences	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
degree	1
of	1
power	1
to	1
the	1
governments	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
States.	1
But	1
if	1
the	1
Union,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
shown,	1
be	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
against	1
foreign	1
danger;	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
essential	1
to	1
their	1
security	1
against	1
contentions	1
and	1
wars	1
among	1
the	1
different	1
States;	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
essential	1
to	1
guard	1
them	1
against	1
those	1
violent	1
and	1
oppressive	1
factions	1
which	1
embitter	1
the	1
blessings	1
of	1
liberty,	1
and	1
against	1
those	1
military	1
establishments	1
which	1
must	1
gradually	1
poison	1
its	1
very	1
fountain;	1
if,	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
the	1
Union	1
be	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
preposterous,	1
to	1
urge	1
as	1
an	1
objection	1
to	1
a	1
government,	1
without	1
which	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
cannot	1
be	1
attained,	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
government	1
may	1
derogate	1
from	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
governments	1
of	1
the	1
individual	1
States?	1
Was,	1
then,	1
the	1
American	1
Revolution	1
effected,	1
was	1
the	1
American	1
Confederacy	1
formed,	1
was	1
the	1
precious	1
blood	1
of	1
thousands	1
spilt,	1
and	1
the	1
hard-earned	1
substance	1
of	1
millions	1
lavished,	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
should	1
enjoy	1
peace,	1
liberty,	1
and	1
safety,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
individual	1
States,	1
that	1
particular	1
municipal	1
establishments,	1
might	1
enjoy	1
a	1
certain	1
extent	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
be	1
arrayed	1
with	1
certain	1
dignities	1
and	1
attributes	1
of	1
sovereignty?	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
impious	1
doctrine	1
in	1
the	1
Old	1
World,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
made	1
for	1
kings,	1
not	1
kings	1
for	1
the	1
people.	1
Is	1
the	1
same	1
doctrine	1
to	1
be	1
revived	1
in	1
the	1
New,	1
in	1
another	1
shape	1
that	1
the	1
solid	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
sacrificed	1
to	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
political	1
institutions	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
form?	1
It	1
is	1
too	1
early	1
for	1
politicians	1
to	1
presume	1
on	1
our	1
forgetting	1
that	1
the	1
public	1
good,	1
the	1
real	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
is	1
the	1
supreme	1
object	1
to	1
be	1
pursued;	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
form	1
of	1
government	1
whatever	1
has	1
any	1
other	1
value	1
than	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
fitted	1
for	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
this	1
object.	1
Were	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
adverse	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
happiness,	1
my	1
voice	1
would	1
be,	1
Reject	1
the	1
plan.	1
Were	1
the	1
Union	1
itself	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
the	1
public	1
happiness,	1
it	1
would	1
be,	1
Abolish	1
the	1
Union.	1
In	1
like	1
manner,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
sovereignty	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
cannot	1
be	1
reconciled	1
to	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
every	1
good	1
citizen	1
must	1
be,	1
Let	1
the	1
former	1
be	1
sacrificed	1
to	1
the	1
latter.	1
How	1
far	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
is	1
necessary,	1
has	1
been	1
shown.	1
How	1
far	1
the	1
unsacrificed	1
residue	1
will	1
be	1
endangered,	1
is	1
the	1
question	1
before	1
us.	1
Several	1
important	1
considerations	1
have	1
been	1
touched	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
papers,	1
which	1
discountenance	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
will	1
by	1
degrees	1
prove	1
fatal	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
governments.	1
The	1
more	1
I	1
revolve	1
the	1
subject,	1
the	1
more	1
fully	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
the	1
balance	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
disturbed	1
by	1
the	1
preponderancy	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
scale.	1
We	1
have	1
seen,	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
examples	1
of	1
ancient	1
and	1
modern	1
confederacies,	1
the	1
strongest	1
tendency	1
continually	1
betraying	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
members,	1
to	1
despoil	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
of	1
its	1
authorities,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
ineffectual	1
capacity	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
to	1
defend	1
itself	1
against	1
the	1
encroachments.	1
Although,	1
in	1
most	1
of	1
these	1
examples,	1
the	1
system	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
dissimilar	1
from	1
that	1
under	1
consideration	1
as	1
greatly	1
to	1
weaken	1
any	1
inference	1
concerning	1
the	1
latter	1
from	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
the	1
former,	1
yet,	1
as	1
the	1
States	1
will	1
retain,	1
under	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
a	1
very	1
extensive	1
portion	1
of	1
active	1
sovereignty,	1
the	1
inference	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
wholly	1
disregarded.	1
In	1
the	1
Achaean	1
league	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
the	1
federal	1
head	1
had	1
a	1
degree	1
and	1
species	1
of	1
power,	1
which	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
considerable	1
likeness	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
framed	1
by	1
the	1
convention.	1
The	1
Lycian	1
Confederacy,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
its	1
principles	1
and	1
form	1
are	1
transmitted,	1
must	1
have	1
borne	1
a	1
still	1
greater	1
analogy	1
to	1
it.	1
Yet	1
history	1
does	1
not	1
inform	1
us	1
that	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
ever	1
degenerated,	1
or	1
tended	1
to	1
degenerate,	1
into	1
one	1
consolidated	1
government.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
proceeded	1
from	1
the	1
incapacity	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
authority	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
dissensions,	1
and	1
finally	1
the	1
disunion,	1
of	1
the	1
subordinate	1
authorities.	1
These	1
cases	1
are	1
the	1
more	1
worthy	1
of	1
our	1
attention,	1
as	1
the	1
external	1
causes	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
component	1
parts	1
were	1
pressed	1
together	1
were	1
much	1
more	1
numerous	1
and	1
powerful	1
than	1
in	1
our	1
case;	1
and	1
consequently	1
less	1
powerful	1
ligaments	1
within	1
would	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
bind	1
the	1
members	1
to	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
to	1
each	1
other.	1
In	1
the	1
feudal	1
system,	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
similar	1
propensity	1
exemplified.	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
proper	1
sympathy	1
in	1
every	1
instance	1
between	1
the	1
local	1
sovereigns	1
and	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
sympathy	1
in	1
some	1
instances	1
between	1
the	1
general	1
sovereign	1
and	1
the	1
latter,	1
it	1
usually	1
happened	1
that	1
the	1
local	1
sovereigns	1
prevailed	1
in	1
the	1
rivalship	1
for	1
encroachments.	1
Had	1
no	1
external	1
dangers	1
enforced	1
internal	1
harmony	1
and	1
subordination,	1
and	1
particularly,	1
had	1
the	1
local	1
sovereigns	1
possessed	1
the	1
affections	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
great	1
kingdoms	1
in	1
Europe	1
would	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
consist	1
of	1
as	1
many	1
independent	1
princes	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
formerly	1
feudatory	1
barons.	1
The	1
State	1
government	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
Federal	1
government,	1
whether	1
we	1
compare	1
them	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
immediate	1
dependence	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
other;	1
to	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
personal	1
influence	1
which	1
each	1
side	1
will	1
possess;	1
to	1
the	1
powers	1
respectively	1
vested	1
in	1
them;	1
to	1
the	1
predilection	1
and	1
probable	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
to	1
the	1
disposition	1
and	1
faculty	1
of	1
resisting	1
and	1
frustrating	1
the	1
measures	1
of	1
each	1
other.	1
The	1
State	1
governments	1
may	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
constituent	1
and	1
essential	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government;	1
whilst	1
the	1
latter	1
is	1
nowise	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
operation	1
or	1
organization	1
of	1
the	1
former.	1
Without	1
the	1
intervention	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
the	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
cannot	1
be	1
elected	1
at	1
all.	1
They	1
must	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
share	1
in	1
his	1
appointment,	1
and	1
will,	1
perhaps,	1
in	1
most	1
cases,	1
of	1
themselves	1
determine	1
it.	1
The	1
Senate	1
will	1
be	1
elected	1
absolutely	1
and	1
exclusively	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures.	1
Even	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
though	1
drawn	1
immediately	1
from	1
the	1
people,	1
will	1
be	1
chosen	1
very	1
much	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
that	1
class	1
of	1
men,	1
whose	1
influence	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
obtains	1
for	1
themselves	1
an	1
election	1
into	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures.	1
Thus,	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
will	1
owe	1
its	1
existence	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
to	1
the	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
and	1
must	1
consequently	1
feel	1
a	1
dependence,	1
which	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
beget	1
a	1
disposition	1
too	1
obsequious	1
than	1
too	1
overbearing	1
towards	1
them.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
the	1
component	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
will	1
in	1
no	1
instance	1
be	1
indebted	1
for	1
their	1
appointment	1
to	1
the	1
direct	1
agency	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
and	1
very	1
little,	1
if	1
at	1
all,	1
to	1
the	1
local	1
influence	1
of	1
its	1
members.	1
The	1
number	1
of	1
individuals	1
employed	1
under	1
the	1
Constitution	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
smaller	1
than	1
the	1
number	1
employed	1
under	1
the	1
particular	1
States.	1
There	1
will	1
consequently	1
be	1
less	1
of	1
personal	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments	1
of	1
thirteen	1
and	1
more	1
States,	1
the	1
justices	1
of	1
peace,	1
officers	1
of	1
militia,	1
ministerial	1
officers	1
of	1
justice,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
county,	1
corporation,	1
and	1
town	1
officers,	1
for	1
three	1
millions	1
and	1
more	1
of	1
people,	1
intermixed,	1
and	1
having	1
particular	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
every	1
class	1
and	1
circle	1
of	1
people,	1
must	1
exceed,	1
beyond	1
all	1
proportion,	1
both	1
in	1
number	1
and	1
influence,	1
those	1
of	1
every	1
description	1
who	1
will	1
be	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
system.	1
Compare	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
great	1
departments	1
of	1
the	1
thirteen	1
States,	1
excluding	1
from	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department	1
the	1
justices	1
of	1
peace,	1
with	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
corresponding	1
departments	1
of	1
the	1
single	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
Union;	1
compare	1
the	1
militia	1
officers	1
of	1
three	1
millions	1
of	1
people	1
with	1
the	1
military	1
and	1
marine	1
officers	1
of	1
any	1
establishment	1
which	1
is	1
within	1
the	1
compass	1
of	1
probability,	1
or,	1
I	1
may	1
add,	1
of	1
possibility,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
view	1
alone,	1
we	1
may	1
pronounce	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
to	1
be	1
decisive.	1
If	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
collectors	1
of	1
revenue,	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
will	1
have	1
theirs	1
also.	1
And	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
will	1
be	1
principally	1
on	1
the	1
seacoast,	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
numerous,	1
whilst	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
will	1
be	1
spread	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
numerous,	1
the	1
advantage	1
in	1
this	1
view	1
also	1
lies	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
side.	1
It	1
is	1
true,	1
that	1
the	1
Confederacy	1
is	1
to	1
possess,	1
and	1
may	1
exercise,	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
collecting	1
internal	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
external	1
taxes	1
throughout	1
the	1
States;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
this	1
power	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
resorted	1
to,	1
except	1
for	1
supplemental	1
purposes	1
of	1
revenue;	1
that	1
an	1
option	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
States	1
to	1
supply	1
their	1
quotas	1
by	1
previous	1
collections	1
of	1
their	1
own;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
eventual	1
collection,	1
under	1
the	1
immediate	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
will	1
generally	1
be	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
officers,	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rules,	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
several	1
States.	1
Indeed	1
it	1
is	1
extremely	1
probable,	1
that	1
in	1
other	1
instances,	1
particularly	1
in	1
the	1
organization	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
power,	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
will	1
be	1
clothed	1
with	1
the	1
correspondent	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
Should	1
it	1
happen,	1
however,	1
that	1
separate	1
collectors	1
of	1
internal	1
revenue	1
should	1
be	1
appointed	1
under	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
number	1
would	1
not	1
bear	1
a	1
comparison	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
multitude	1
of	1
State	1
officers	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
scale.	1
Within	1
every	1
district	1
to	1
which	1
a	1
federal	1
collector	1
would	1
be	1
allotted,	1
there	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
less	1
than	1
thirty	1
or	1
forty,	1
or	1
even	1
more,	1
officers	1
of	1
different	1
descriptions,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
persons	1
of	1
character	1
and	1
weight,	1
whose	1
influence	1
would	1
lie	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
State.	1
The	1
powers	1
delegated	1
by	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
are	1
few	1
and	1
defined.	1
Those	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
are	1
numerous	1
and	1
indefinite.	1
The	1
former	1
will	1
be	1
exercised	1
principally	1
on	1
external	1
objects,	1
as	1
war,	1
peace,	1
negotiation,	1
and	1
foreign	1
commerce;	1
with	1
which	1
last	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
taxation	1
will,	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part,	1
be	1
connected.	1
The	1
powers	1
reserved	1
to	1
the	1
several	1
States	1
will	1
extend	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
objects	1
which,	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
course	1
of	1
affairs,	1
concern	1
the	1
lives,	1
liberties,	1
and	1
properties	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
internal	1
order,	1
improvement,	1
and	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
State.	1
The	1
operations	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
extensive	1
and	1
important	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
danger;	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
security.	1
As	1
the	1
former	1
periods	1
will	1
probably	1
bear	1
a	1
small	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
latter,	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
will	1
here	1
enjoy	1
another	1
advantage	1
over	1
the	1
federal	1
government.	1
The	1
more	1
adequate,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
federal	1
powers	1
may	1
be	1
rendered	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
defense,	1
the	1
less	1
frequent	1
will	1
be	1
those	1
scenes	1
of	1
danger	1
which	1
might	1
favor	1
their	1
ascendancy	1
over	1
the	1
governments	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
States.	1
If	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution	1
be	1
examined	1
with	1
accuracy	1
and	1
candor,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
change	1
which	1
it	1
proposes	1
consists	1
much	1
less	1
in	1
the	1
addition	1
of	1
NEW	1
POWERS	1
to	1
the	1
Union,	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
invigoration	1
of	1
its	1
ORIGINAL	1
POWERS.	1
The	1
regulation	1
of	1
commerce,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
is	1
a	1
new	1
power;	1
but	1
that	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
addition	1
which	1
few	1
oppose,	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
no	1
apprehensions	1
are	1
entertained.	1
The	1
powers	1
relating	1
to	1
war	1
and	1
peace,	1
armies	1
and	1
fleets,	1
treaties	1
and	1
finance,	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
more	1
considerable	1
powers,	1
are	1
all	1
vested	1
in	1
the	1
existing	1
Congress	1
by	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation.	1
The	1
proposed	1
change	1
does	1
not	1
enlarge	1
these	1
powers;	1
it	1
only	1
substitutes	1
a	1
more	1
effectual	1
mode	1
of	1
administering	1
them.	1
The	1
change	1
relating	1
to	1
taxation	1
may	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
important;	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
present	1
Congress	1
have	1
as	1
complete	1
authority	1
to	1
REQUIRE	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
indefinite	1
supplies	1
of	1
money	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
defense	1
and	1
general	1
welfare,	1
as	1
the	1
future	1
Congress	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
require	1
them	1
of	1
individual	1
citizens;	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
bound	1
than	1
the	1
States	1
themselves	1
have	1
been,	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
quotas	1
respectively	1
taxed	1
on	1
them.	1
Had	1
the	1
States	1
complied	1
punctually	1
with	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Confederation,	1
or	1
could	1
their	1
compliance	1
have	1
been	1
enforced	1
by	1
as	1
peaceable	1
means	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
used	1
with	1
success	1
towards	1
single	1
persons,	1
our	1
past	1
experience	1
is	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
countenancing	1
an	1
opinion,	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
would	1
have	1
lost	1
their	1
constitutional	1
powers,	1
and	1
have	1
gradually	1

To	1

that	1

would	1
be	1
to	1
say	1
at	1
once,	1
that	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
State	1

is	1
incompatible	1
with	1
any	1

that	1
accomplishes	1

the	1

RESUMING	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
paper,	1
I	1
proceed	1
to	1
inquire	1
whether	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
or	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
advantage	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
predilection	1
and	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
different	1
modes	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
appointed,	1
we	1
must	1
consider	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
substantially	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
I	1
assume	1
this	1
position	1
here	1
as	1
it	1
respects	1
the	1
first,	1
reserving	1
the	1
proofs	1
for	1
another	1
place.	1
The	1
federal	1
and	1
State	1
governments	1
are	1
in	1
fact	1
but	1
different	1
agents	1
and	1
trustees	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
constituted	1
with	1
different	1
powers,	1
and	1
designed	1
for	1
different	1
purposes.	1
The	1
adversaries	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
altogether	1
in	1
their	1
reasonings	1
on	1
this	1
subject;	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
viewed	1
these	1
different	1
establishments,	1
not	1
only	1
as	1
mutual	1
rivals	1
and	1
enemies,	1
but	1
as	1
uncontrolled	1
by	1
any	1
common	1
superior	1
in	1
their	1
efforts	1
to	1
usurp	1
the	1
authorities	1
of	1
each	1
other.	1
These	1
gentlemen	1
must	1
here	1
be	1
reminded	1
of	1
their	1
error.	1
They	1
must	1
be	1
told	1
that	1
the	1
ultimate	1
authority,	1
wherever	1
the	1
derivative	1
may	1
be	1
found,	1
resides	1
in	1
the	1
people	1
alone,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
depend	1
merely	1
on	1
the	1
comparative	1
ambition	1
or	1
address	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
governments,	1
whether	1
either,	1
or	1
which	1
of	1
them,	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
enlarge	1
its	1
sphere	1
of	1
jurisdiction	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
Truth,	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
decency,	1
requires	1
that	1
the	1
event	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
should	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
sentiments	1
and	1
sanction	1
of	1
their	1
common	1
constituents.	1
Many	1
considerations,	1
besides	1
those	1
suggested	1
on	1
a	1
former	1
occasion,	1
seem	1
to	1
place	1
it	1
beyond	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
most	1
natural	1
attachment	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
governments	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
States.	1
Into	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
these	1
a	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
individuals	1
will	1
expect	1
to	1
rise.	1
From	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
these	1
a	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
offices	1
and	1
emoluments	1
will	1
flow.	1
By	1
the	1
superintending	1
care	1
of	1
these,	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
domestic	1
and	1
personal	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
be	1
regulated	1
and	1
provided	1
for.	1
With	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
these,	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
familiarly	1
and	1
minutely	1
conversant.	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
these,	1
will	1
a	1
greater	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
have	1
the	1
ties	1
of	1
personal	1
acquaintance	1
and	1
friendship,	1
and	1
of	1
family	1
and	1
party	1
attachments;	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
these,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
popular	1
bias	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
expected	1
most	1
strongly	1
to	1
incline.	1
Experience	1
speaks	1
the	1
same	1
language	1
in	1
this	1
case.	1
The	1
federal	1
administration,	1
though	1
hitherto	1
very	1
defective	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
hoped	1
under	1
a	1
better	1
system,	1
had,	1
during	1
the	1
war,	1
and	1
particularly	1
whilst	1
the	1
independent	1
fund	1
of	1
paper	1
emissions	1
was	1
in	1
credit,	1
an	1
activity	1
and	1
importance	1
as	1
great	1
as	1
it	1
can	1
well	1
have	1
in	1
any	1
future	1
circumstances	1
whatever.	1
It	1
was	1
engaged,	1
too,	1
in	1
a	1
course	1
of	1
measures	1
which	1
had	1
for	1
their	1
object	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
dear,	1
and	1
the	1
acquisition	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
desirable	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large.	1
It	1
was,	1
nevertheless,	1
invariably	1
found,	1
after	1
the	1
transient	1
enthusiasm	1
for	1
the	1
early	1
Congresses	1
was	1
over,	1
that	1
the	1
attention	1
and	1
attachment	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
turned	1
anew	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
particular	1
governments;	1
that	1
the	1
federal	1
council	1
was	1
at	1
no	1
time	1
the	1
idol	1
of	1
popular	1
favor;	1
and	1
that	1
opposition	1
to	1
proposed	1
enlargements	1
of	1
its	1
powers	1
and	1
importance	1
was	1
the	1
side	1
usually	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
build	1
their	1
political	1
consequence	1
on	1
the	1
prepossessions	1
of	1
their	1
fellow-citizens.	1
If,	1
therefore,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
elsewhere	1
remarked,	1
the	1
people	1
should	1
in	1
future	1
become	1
more	1
partial	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
the	1
change	1
can	1
only	1
result	1
from	1
such	1
manifest	1
and	1
irresistible	1
proofs	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
administration,	1
as	1
will	1
overcome	1
all	1
their	1
antecedent	1
propensities.	1
And	1
in	1
that	1
case,	1
the	1
people	1
ought	1
not	1
surely	1
to	1
be	1
precluded	1
from	1
giving	1
most	1
of	1
their	1
confidence	1
where	1
they	1
may	1
discover	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
most	1
due;	1
but	1
even	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
could	1
have	1
little	1
to	1
apprehend,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
within	1
a	1
certain	1
sphere	1
that	1
the	1
federal	1
power	1
can,	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
things,	1
be	1
advantageously	1
administered.	1
The	1
remaining	1
points	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
propose	1
to	1
compare	1
the	1
federal	1
and	1
State	1
governments,	1
are	1
the	1
disposition	1
and	1
the	1
faculty	1
they	1
may	1
respectively	1
possess,	1
to	1
resist	1
and	1
frustrate	1
the	1
measures	1
of	1
each	1
other.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
than	1
the	1
latter	1
will	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
former.	1
It	1
has	1
appeared	1
also,	1
that	1
the	1
prepossessions	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
on	1
whom	1
both	1
will	1
depend,	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government.	1
So	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
each	1
towards	1
the	1
other	1
may	1
be	1
influenced	1
by	1
these	1
causes,	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
must	1
clearly	1
have	1
the	1
advantage.	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
distinct	1
and	1
very	1
important	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
the	1
advantage	1
will	1
lie	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
side.	1
The	1
prepossessions,	1
which	1
the	1
members	1
themselves	1
will	1
carry	1
into	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
will	1
generally	1
be	1
favorable	1
to	1
the	1
States;	1
whilst	1
it	1
will	1
rarely	1
happen,	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
will	1
carry	1
into	1
the	1
public	1
councils	1
a	1
bias	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
government.	1
A	1
local	1
spirit	1
will	1
infallibly	1
prevail	1
much	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
Congress,	1
than	1
a	1
national	1
spirit	1
will	1
prevail	1
in	1
the	1
legislatures	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
States.	1
Every	1
one	1
knows	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
errors	1
committed	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
proceeds	1
from	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
comprehensive	1
and	1
permanent	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
State,	1
to	1
the	1
particular	1
and	1
separate	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
counties	1
or	1
districts	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
reside.	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
enlarge	1
their	1
policy	1
to	1
embrace	1
the	1
collective	1
welfare	1
of	1
their	1
particular	1
State,	1
how	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
imagined	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
aggregate	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
the	1
dignity	1
and	1
respectability	1
of	1
its	1
government,	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
their	1
affections	1
and	1
consultations?	1
For	1
the	1
same	1
reason	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
will	1
be	1
unlikely	1
to	1
attach	1
themselves	1
sufficiently	1
to	1
national	1
objects,	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
legislature	1
will	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
attach	1
themselves	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
local	1
objects.	1
The	1
States	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
latter	1
what	1
counties	1
and	1
towns	1
are	1
to	1
the	1
former.	1
Measures	1
will	1
too	1
often	1
be	1
decided	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
probable	1
effect,	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
national	1
prosperity	1
and	1
happiness,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
prejudices,	1
interests,	1
and	1
pursuits	1
of	1
the	1
governments	1
and	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
individual	1
States.	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
that	1
has	1
in	1
general	1
characterized	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
Congress?	1
A	1
perusal	1
of	1
their	1
journals,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
candid	1
acknowledgments	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
seat	1
in	1
that	1
assembly,	1
will	1
inform	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
have	1
but	1
too	1
frequently	1
displayed	1
the	1
character,	1
rather	1
of	1
partisans	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
States,	1
than	1
of	1
impartial	1
guardians	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
interest;	1
that	1
where	1
on	1
one	1
occasion	1
improper	1
sacrifices	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
of	1
local	1
considerations,	1
to	1
the	1
aggrandizement	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
the	1
great	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
have	1
suffered	1
on	1
a	1
hundred,	1
from	1
an	1
undue	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
local	1
prejudices,	1
interests,	1
and	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
States.	1
I	1
mean	1
not	1
by	1
these	1
reflections	1
to	1
insinuate,	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
federal	1
government	1
will	1
not	1
embrace	1
a	1
more	1
enlarged	1
plan	1
of	1
policy	1
than	1
the	1
existing	1
government	1
may	1
have	1
pursued;	1
much	1
less,	1
that	1
its	1
views	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
confined	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures;	1
but	1
only	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
partake	1
sufficiently	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
both,	1
to	1
be	1
disinclined	1
to	1
invade	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
individual	1
States,	1
or	1
the	1
preorgatives	1
of	1
their	1
governments.	1
The	1
motives	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
to	1
augment	1
their	1
prerogatives	1
by	1
defalcations	1
from	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
will	1
be	1
overruled	1
by	1
no	1
reciprocal	1
predispositions	1
in	1
the	1
members.	1
Were	1
it	1
admitted,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
Federal	1
government	1
may	1
feel	1
an	1
equal	1
disposition	1
with	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
to	1
extend	1
its	1
power	1
beyond	1
the	1
due	1
limits,	1
the	1
latter	1
would	1
still	1
have	1
the	1
advantage	1
in	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
defeating	1
such	1
encroachments.	1
If	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
a	1
particular	1
State,	1
though	1
unfriendly	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
be	1
generally	1
popular	1
in	1
that	1
State	1
and	1
should	1
not	1
too	1
grossly	1
violate	1
the	1
oaths	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
officers,	1
it	1
is	1
executed	1
immediately	1
and,	1
of	1
course,	1
by	1
means	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
and	1
depending	1
on	1
the	1
State	1
alone.	1
The	1
opposition	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
or	1
the	1
interposition	1
of	1
federal	1
officers,	1
would	1
but	1
inflame	1
the	1
zeal	1
of	1
all	1
parties	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
State,	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
prevented	1
or	1
repaired,	1
if	1
at	1
all,	1
without	1
the	1
employment	1
of	1
means	1
which	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
resorted	1
to	1
with	1
reluctance	1
and	1
difficulty.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
should	1
an	1
unwarrantable	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
be	1
unpopular	1
in	1
particular	1
States,	1
which	1
would	1
seldom	1
fail	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
warrantable	1
measure	1
be	1
so,	1
which	1
may	1
sometimes	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
opposition	1
to	1
it	1
are	1
powerful	1
and	1
at	1
hand.	1
The	1
disquietude	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
their	1
repugnance	1
and,	1
perhaps,	1
refusal	1
to	1
co-operate	1
with	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Union;	1
the	1
frowns	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
magistracy	1
of	1
the	1
State;	1
the	1
embarrassments	1
created	1
by	1
legislative	1
devices,	1
which	1
would	1
often	1
be	1
added	1
on	1
such	1
occasions,	1
would	1
oppose,	1
in	1
any	1
State,	1
difficulties	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
despised;	1
would	1
form,	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
State,	1
very	1
serious	1
impediments;	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
sentiments	1
of	1
several	1
adjoining	1
States	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
unison,	1
would	1
present	1
obstructions	1
which	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
would	1
hardly	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
encounter.	1
But	1
ambitious	1
encroachments	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
on	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
would	1
not	1
excite	1
the	1
opposition	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
State,	1
or	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
States	1
only.	1
They	1
would	1
be	1
signals	1
of	1
general	1
alarm.	1
Every	1
government	1
would	1
espouse	1
the	1
common	1
cause.	1
A	1
correspondence	1
would	1
be	1
opened.	1
Plans	1
of	1
resistance	1
would	1
be	1
concerted.	1
One	1
spirit	1
would	1
animate	1
and	1
conduct	1
the	1
whole.	1
The	1
same	1
combinations,	1
in	1
short,	1
would	1
result	1
from	1
an	1
apprehension	1
of	1
the	1
federal,	1
as	1
was	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
a	1
foreign,	1
yoke;	1
and	1
unless	1
the	1
projected	1
innovations	1
should	1
be	1
voluntarily	1
renounced,	1
the	1
same	1
appeal	1
to	1
a	1
trial	1
of	1
force	1
would	1
be	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
case	1
as	1
was	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
But	1
what	1
degree	1
of	1
madness	1
could	1
ever	1
drive	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
extremity.	1
In	1
the	1
contest	1
with	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
empire	1
was	1
employed	1
against	1
the	1
other.	1
The	1
more	1
numerous	1
part	1
invaded	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
less	1
numerous	1
part.	1
The	1
attempt	1
was	1
unjust	1
and	1
unwise;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
speculation	1
absolutely	1
chimerical.	1
But	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
contest	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
we	1
are	1
supposing?	1
Who	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
parties?	1
A	1
few	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
would	1
be	1
opposed	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
themselves;	1
or	1
rather	1
one	1
set	1
of	1
representatives	1
would	1
be	1
contending	1
against	1
thirteen	1
sets	1
of	1
representatives,	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
of	1
their	1
common	1
constituents	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
only	1
refuge	1
left	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
prophesy	1
the	1
downfall	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
is	1
the	1
visionary	1
supposition	1
that	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
may	1
previously	1
accumulate	1
a	1
military	1
force	1
for	1
the	1
projects	1
of	1
ambition.	1
The	1
reasonings	1
contained	1
in	1
these	1
papers	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
employed	1
to	1
little	1
purpose	1
indeed,	1
if	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
necessary	1
now	1
to	1
disprove	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
this	1
danger.	1
That	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
States	1
should,	1
for	1
a	1
sufficient	1
period	1
of	1
time,	1
elect	1
an	1
uninterrupted	1
succession	1
of	1
men	1
ready	1
to	1
betray	1
both;	1
that	1
the	1
traitors	1
should,	1
throughout	1
this	1
period,	1
uniformly	1
and	1
systematically	1
pursue	1
some	1
fixed	1
plan	1
for	1
the	1
extension	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
establishment;	1
that	1
the	1
governments	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
should	1
silently	1
and	1
patiently	1
behold	1
the	1
gathering	1
storm,	1
and	1
continue	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
materials,	1
until	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
prepared	1
to	1
burst	1
on	1
their	1
own	1
heads,	1
must	1
appear	1
to	1
every	1
one	1
more	1
like	1
the	1
incoherent	1
dreams	1
of	1
a	1
delirious	1
jealousy,	1
or	1
the	1
misjudged	1
exaggerations	1
of	1
a	1
counterfeit	1
zeal,	1
than	1
like	1
the	1
sober	1
apprehensions	1
of	1
genuine	1
patriotism.	1
Extravagant	1
as	1
the	1
supposition	1
is,	1
let	1
it	1
however	1
be	1
made.	1
Let	1
a	1
regular	1
army,	1
fully	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
be	1
formed;	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
entirely	1
at	1
the	1
devotion	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government;	1
still	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
going	1
too	1
far	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
on	1
their	1
side,	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
repel	1
the	1
danger.	1
The	1
highest	1
number	1
to	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
computation,	1
a	1
standing	1
army	1
can	1
be	1
carried	1
in	1
any	1
country,	1
does	1
not	1
exceed	1
one	1
hundredth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
number	1
of	1
souls;	1
or	1
one	1
twenty-fifth	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
arms.	1
This	1
proportion	1
would	1
not	1
yield,	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
twenty-five	1
or	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
men.	1
To	1
these	1
would	1
be	1
opposed	1
a	1
militia	1
amounting	1
to	1
near	1
half	1
a	1
million	1
of	1
citizens	1
with	1
arms	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
officered	1
by	1
men	1
chosen	1
from	1
among	1
themselves,	1
fighting	1
for	1
their	1
common	1
liberties,	1
and	1
united	1
and	1
conducted	1
by	1
governments	1
possessing	1
their	1
affections	1
and	1
confidence.	1
It	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
doubted,	1
whether	1
a	1
militia	1
thus	1
circumstanced	1
could	1
ever	1
be	1
conquered	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
proportion	1
of	1
regular	1
troops.	1
Those	1
who	1
are	1
best	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
last	1
successful	1
resistance	1
of	1
this	1
country	1
against	1
the	1
British	1
arms,	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
inclined	1
to	1
deny	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
it.	1
Besides	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
being	1
armed,	1
which	1
the	1
Americans	1
possess	1
over	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
almost	1
every	1
other	1
nation,	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
subordinate	1
governments,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
attached,	1
and	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
militia	1
officers	1
are	1
appointed,	1
forms	1
a	1
barrier	1
against	1
the	1
enterprises	1
of	1
ambition,	1
more	1
insurmountable	1
than	1
any	1
which	1
a	1
simple	1
government	1
of	1
any	1
form	1
can	1
admit	1
of.	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
military	1
establishments	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
Europe,	1
which	1
are	1
carried	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
public	1
resources	1
will	1
bear,	1
the	1
governments	1
are	1
afraid	1
to	1
trust	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
arms.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
certain,	1
that	1
with	1
this	1
aid	1
alone	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
shake	1
off	1
their	1
yokes.	1
But	1
were	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
additional	1
advantages	1
of	1
local	1
governments	1
chosen	1
by	1
themselves,	1
who	1
could	1
collect	1
the	1
national	1
will	1
and	1
direct	1
the	1
national	1
force,	1
and	1
of	1
officers	1
appointed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
militia,	1
by	1
these	1
governments,	1
and	1
attached	1
both	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
militia,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
affirmed	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
assurance,	1
that	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
every	1
tyranny	1
in	1
Europe	1
would	1
be	1
speedily	1
overturned	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
legions	1
which	1
surround	1
it.	1
Let	1
us	1
not	1
insult	1
the	1
free	1
and	1
gallant	1
citizens	1
of	1
America	1
with	1
the	1
suspicion,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
less	1
able	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
actual	1
possession,	1
than	1
the	1
debased	1
subjects	1
of	1
arbitrary	1
power	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
rescue	1
theirs	1
from	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
oppressors.	1
Let	1
us	1
rather	1
no	1
longer	1
insult	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
ever	1
reduce	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
making	1
the	1
experiment,	1
by	1
a	1
blind	1
and	1
tame	1
submission	1
to	1
the	1
long	1
train	1
of	1
insidious	1
measures	1
which	1
must	1
precede	1
and	1
produce	1
it.	1
The	1
argument	1
under	1
the	1
present	1
head	1
may	1
be	1
put	1
into	1
a	1
very	1
concise	1
form,	1
which	1
appears	1
altogether	1
conclusive.	1
Either	1
the	1
mode	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
constructed	1
will	1
render	1
it	1
sufficiently	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
people,	1
or	1
it	1
will	1
not.	1
On	1
the	1
first	1
supposition,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
restrained	1
by	1
that	1
dependence	1
from	1
forming	1
schemes	1
obnoxious	1
to	1
their	1
constituents.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
supposition,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
possess	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
its	1
schemes	1
of	1
usurpation	1
will	1
be	1
easily	1
defeated	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
who	1
will	1
be	1
supported	1
by	1
the	1
people.	1
On	1
summing	1
up	1
the	1
considerations	1
stated	1
in	1
this	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
paper,	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
amount	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
convincing	1
evidence,	1
that	1
the	1
powers	1
proposed	1
to	1
be	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
are	1
as	1
little	1
formidable	1
to	1
those	1
reserved	1
to	1
the	1
individual	1
States,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
indispensably	1
necessary	1
to	1
accomplish	1
the	1
purposes	1
of	1
the	1
Union;	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
alarms	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
sounded,	1
of	1
a	1
meditated	1
and	1
consequential	1
annihilation	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
must,	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
favorable	1
interpretation,	1
be	1
ascribed	1
to	1
the	1
chimerical	1
fears	1
of	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
them.	1

MADISON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
HAVING	1
reviewed	1
the	1
general	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
government	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
mass	1
of	1
power	1
allotted	1
to	1
it,	1
I	1
proceed	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
particular	1
structure	1
of	1
this	1
government,	1
and	1
the	1
distribution	1
of	1
this	1
mass	1
of	1
power	1
among	1
its	1
constituent	1
parts.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
objections	1
inculcated	1
by	1
the	1
more	1
respectable	1
adversaries	1
to	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
is	1
its	1
supposed	1
violation	1
of	1
the	1
political	1
maxim,	1
that	1
the	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
separate	1
and	1
distinct.	1
In	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
no	1
regard,	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
paid	1
to	1
this	1
essential	1
precaution	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
liberty.	1
The	1
several	1
departments	1
of	1
power	1
are	1
distributed	1
and	1
blended	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
destroy	1
all	1
symmetry	1
and	1
beauty	1
of	1
form,	1
and	1
to	1
expose	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
essential	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
edifice	1
to	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
crushed	1
by	1
the	1
disproportionate	1
weight	1
of	1
other	1
parts.	1
No	1
political	1
truth	1
is	1
certainly	1
of	1
greater	1
intrinsic	1
value,	1
or	1
is	1
stamped	1
with	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
more	1
enlightened	1
patrons	1
of	1
liberty,	1
than	1
that	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
objection	1
is	1
founded.	1
The	1
accumulation	1
of	1
all	1
powers,	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judiciary,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
hands,	1
whether	1
of	1
one,	1
a	1
few,	1
or	1
many,	1
and	1
whether	1
hereditary,	1
selfappointed,	1
or	1
elective,	1
may	1
justly	1
be	1
pronounced	1
the	1
very	1
definition	1
of	1
tyranny.	1
Were	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution,	1
therefore,	1
really	1
chargeable	1
with	1
the	1
accumulation	1
of	1
power,	1
or	1
with	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
powers,	1
having	1
a	1
dangerous	1
tendency	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
accumulation,	1
no	1
further	1
arguments	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
inspire	1
a	1
universal	1
reprobation	1
of	1
the	1
system.	1
I	1
persuade	1
myself,	1
however,	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
made	1
apparent	1
to	1
every	1
one,	1
that	1
the	1
charge	1
cannot	1
be	1
supported,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
maxim	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
relies	1
has	1
been	1
totally	1
misconceived	1
and	1
misapplied.	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
form	1
correct	1
ideas	1
on	1
this	1
important	1
subject,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
proper	1
to	1
investigate	1
the	1
sense	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
liberty	1
requires	1
that	1
the	1
three	1
great	1
departments	1
of	1
power	1
should	1
be	1
separate	1
and	1
distinct.	1
The	1
oracle	1
who	1
is	1
always	1
consulted	1
and	1
cited	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
is	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Montesquieu.	1
If	1
he	1
be	1
not	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
invaluable	1
precept	1
in	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
politics,	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
merit	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
displaying	1
and	1
recommending	1
it	1
most	1
effectually	1
to	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
mankind.	1
Let	1
us	1
endeavor,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
to	1
ascertain	1
his	1
meaning	1
on	1
this	1
point.	1
The	1
British	1
Constitution	1
was	1
to	1
Montesquieu	1
what	1
Homer	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
didactic	1
writers	1
on	1
epic	1
poetry.	1
As	1
the	1
latter	1
have	1
considered	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
immortal	1
bard	1
as	1
the	1
perfect	1
model	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
principles	1
and	1
rules	1
of	1
the	1
epic	1
art	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
drawn,	1
and	1
by	1
which	1
all	1
similar	1
works	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
judged,	1
so	1
this	1
great	1
political	1
critic	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
viewed	1
the	1
Constitution	1
of	1
England	1
as	1
the	1
standard,	1
or	1
to	1
use	1
his	1
own	1
expression,	1
as	1
the	1
mirror	1
of	1
political	1
liberty;	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
delivered,	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
elementary	1
truths,	1
the	1
several	1
characteristic	1
principles	1
of	1
that	1
particular	1
system.	1
That	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
sure,	1
then,	1
not	1
to	1
mistake	1
his	1
meaning	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
let	1
us	1
recur	1
to	1
the	1
source	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
maxim	1
was	1
drawn.	1
On	1
the	1
slightest	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
Constitution,	1
we	1
must	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments	1
are	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
totally	1
separate	1
and	1
distinct	1
from	1
each	1
other.	1
The	1
executive	1
magistrate	1
forms	1
an	1
integral	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority.	1
He	1
alone	1
has	1
the	1
prerogative	1
of	1
making	1
treaties	1
with	1
foreign	1
sovereigns,	1
which,	1
when	1
made,	1
have,	1
under	1
certain	1
limitations,	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
legislative	1
acts.	1
All	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department	1
are	1
appointed	1
by	1
him,	1
can	1
be	1
removed	1
by	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
address	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
Houses	1
of	1
Parliament,	1
and	1
form,	1
when	1
he	1
pleases	1
to	1
consult	1
them,	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
constitutional	1
councils.	1
One	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
department	1
forms	1
also	1
a	1
great	1
constitutional	1
council	1
to	1
the	1
executive	1
chief,	1
as,	1
on	1
another	1
hand,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
sole	1
depositary	1
of	1
judicial	1
power	1
in	1
cases	1
of	1
impeachment,	1
and	1
is	1
invested	1
with	1
the	1
supreme	1
appellate	1
jurisdiction	1
in	1
all	1
other	1
cases.	1
The	1
judges,	1
again,	1
are	1
so	1
far	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
legislative	1
department	1
as	1
often	1
to	1
attend	1
and	1
participate	1
in	1
its	1
deliberations,	1
though	1
not	1
admitted	1
to	1
a	1
legislative	1
vote.	1
From	1
these	1
facts,	1
by	1
which	1
Montesquieu	1
was	1
guided,	1
it	1
may	1
clearly	1
be	1
inferred	1
that,	1
in	1
saying	1
"There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
liberty	1
where	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
executive	1
powers	1
are	1
united	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
person,	1
or	1
body	1
of	1
magistrates,"	1
or,	1
"if	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
judging	1
be	1
not	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
executive	1
powers,"	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
these	1
departments	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
PARTIAL	1
AGENCY	1
in,	1
or	1
no	1
CONTROL	1
over,	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
each	1
other.	1
His	1
meaning,	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
words	1
import,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
conclusively	1
as	1
illustrated	1
by	1
the	1
example	1
in	1
his	1
eye,	1
can	1
amount	1
to	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
this,	1
that	1
where	1
the	1
WHOLE	1
power	1
of	1
one	1
department	1
is	1
exercised	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
hands	1
which	1
possess	1
the	1
WHOLE	1
power	1
of	1
another	1
department,	1
the	1
fundamental	1
principles	1
of	1
a	1
free	1
constitution	1
are	1
subverted.	1
This	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
the	1
constitution	1
examined	1
by	1
him,	1
if	1
the	1
king,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
sole	1
executive	1
magistrate,	1
had	1
possessed	1
also	1
the	1
complete	1
legislative	1
power,	1
or	1
the	1
supreme	1
administration	1
of	1
justice;	1
or	1
if	1
the	1
entire	1
legislative	1
body	1
had	1
possessed	1
the	1
supreme	1
judiciary,	1
or	1
the	1
supreme	1
executive	1
authority.	1
This,	1
however,	1
is	1
not	1
among	1
the	1
vices	1
of	1
that	1
constitution.	1
The	1
magistrate	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
whole	1
executive	1
power	1
resides	1
cannot	1
of	1
himself	1
make	1
a	1
law,	1
though	1
he	1
can	1
put	1
a	1
negative	1
on	1
every	1
law;	1
nor	1
administer	1
justice	1
in	1
person,	1
though	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
administer	1
it.	1
The	1
judges	1
can	1
exercise	1
no	1
executive	1
prerogative,	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
shoots	1
from	1
the	1
executive	1
stock;	1
nor	1
any	1
legislative	1
function,	1
though	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
advised	1
with	1
by	1
the	1
legislative	1
councils.	1
The	1
entire	1
legislature	1
can	1
perform	1
no	1
judiciary	1
act,	1
though	1
by	1
the	1
joint	1
act	1
of	1
two	1
of	1
its	1
branches	1
the	1
judges	1
may	1
be	1
removed	1
from	1
their	1
offices,	1
and	1
though	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
branches	1
is	1
possessed	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
resort.	1
The	1
entire	1
legislature,	1
again,	1
can	1
exercise	1
no	1
executive	1
prerogative,	1
though	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
branches	1
constitutes	1
the	1
supreme	1
executive	1
magistracy,	1
and	1
another,	1
on	1
the	1
impeachment	1
of	1
a	1
third,	1
can	1
try	1
and	1
condemn	1
all	1
the	1
subordinate	1
officers	1
in	1
the	1
executive	1
department.	1
The	1
reasons	1
on	1
which	1
Montesquieu	1
grounds	1
his	1
maxim	1
are	1
a	1
further	1
demonstration	1
of	1
his	1
meaning.	1
"When	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
executive	1
powers	1
are	1
united	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
person	1
or	1
body,"	1
says	1
he,	1
"there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
liberty,	1
because	1
apprehensions	1
may	1
arise	1
lest	1
THE	1
SAME	1
monarch	1
or	1
senate	1
should	1
ENACT	1
tyrannical	1
laws	1
to	1
EXECUTE	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
tyrannical	1
manner.	1
"	1
Again:	1
"Were	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
judging	1
joined	1
with	1
the	1
legislative,	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
would	1
be	1
exposed	1
to	1
arbitrary	1
control,	1
for	1
THE	1
JUDGE	1
would	1
then	1
be	1
THE	1
LEGISLATOR.	1
Were	1
it	1
joined	1
to	1
the	1
executive	1
power,	1
THE	1
JUDGE	1
might	1
behave	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
AN	1
OPPRESSOR.	1
"	1
Some	1
of	1
these	1
reasons	1
are	1
more	1
fully	1
explained	1
in	1
other	1
passages;	1
but	1
briefly	1
stated	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
here,	1
they	1
sufficiently	1
establish	1
the	1
meaning	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
put	1
on	1
this	1
celebrated	1
maxim	1
of	1
this	1
celebrated	1
author.	1
If	1
we	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
constitutions	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
we	1
find	1
that,	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
emphatical	1
and,	1
in	1
some	1
instances,	1
the	1
unqualified	1
terms	1
in	1
which	1
this	1
axiom	1
has	1
been	1
laid	1
down,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
instance	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
several	1
departments	1
of	1
power	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
absolutely	1
separate	1
and	1
distinct.	1
New	1
Hampshire,	1
whose	1
constitution	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
formed,	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
fully	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
impossibility	1
and	1
inexpediency	1
of	1
avoiding	1
any	1
mixture	1
whatever	1
of	1
these	1
departments,	1
and	1
has	1
qualified	1
the	1
doctrine	1
by	1
declaring	1
"that	1
the	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judiciary	1
powers	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
as	1
separate	1
from,	1
and	1
independent	1
of,	1
each	1
other	1
AS	1
THE	1
NATURE	1
OF	1
A	1
FREE	1
GOVERNMENT	1
WILL	1
ADMIT;	1
OR	1
AS	1
IS	1
CONSISTENT	1
WITH	1
THAT	1
CHAIN	1
OF	1
CONNECTION	1
THAT	1
BINDS	1
THE	1
WHOLE	1
FABRIC	1
OF	1
THE	1
CONSTITUTION	1
IN	1
ONE	1
INDISSOLUBLE	1
BOND	1
OF	1
UNITY	1
AND	1
AMITY.	1
"	1
Her	1
constitution	1
accordingly	1
mixes	1
these	1
departments	1
in	1
several	1
respects.	1
The	1
Senate,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
department,	1
is	1
also	1
a	1
judicial	1
tribunal	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
impeachments.	1
The	1
President,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
department,	1
is	1
the	1
presiding	1
member	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Senate;	1
and,	1
besides	1
an	1
equal	1
vote	1
in	1
all	1
cases,	1
has	1
a	1
casting	1
vote	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
tie.	1
The	1
executive	1
head	1
is	1
himself	1
eventually	1
elective	1
every	1
year	1
by	1
the	1
legislative	1
department,	1
and	1
his	1
council	1
is	1
every	1
year	1
chosen	1
by	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
department.	1
Several	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
state	1
are	1
also	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
legislature.	1
And	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department	1
are	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
executive	1
department.	1
The	1
constitution	1
of	1
Massachusetts	1
has	1
observed	1
a	1
sufficient	1
though	1
less	1
pointed	1
caution,	1
in	1
expressing	1
this	1
fundamental	1
article	1
of	1
liberty.	1
It	1
declares	1
"that	1
the	1
legislative	1
department	1
shall	1
never	1
exercise	1
the	1
executive	1
and	1
judicial	1
powers,	1
or	1
either	1
of	1
them;	1
the	1
executive	1
shall	1
never	1
exercise	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
judicial	1
powers,	1
or	1
either	1
of	1
them;	1
the	1
judicial	1
shall	1
never	1
exercise	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
executive	1
powers,	1
or	1
either	1
of	1
them.	1
"	1
This	1
declaration	1
corresponds	1
precisely	1
with	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
Montesquieu,	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
explained,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
point	1
violated	1
by	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention.	1
It	1
goes	1
no	1
farther	1
than	1
to	1
prohibit	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
departments	1
from	1
exercising	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
another	1
department.	1
In	1
the	1
very	1
Constitution	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
prefixed,	1
a	1
partial	1
mixture	1
of	1
powers	1
has	1
been	1
admitted.	1
The	1
executive	1
magistrate	1
has	1
a	1
qualified	1
negative	1
on	1
the	1
legislative	1
body,	1
and	1
the	1
Senate,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
is	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
impeachment	1
for	1
members	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department,	1
again,	1
are	1
appointable	1
by	1
the	1
executive	1
department,	1
and	1
removable	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
authority	1
on	1
the	1
address	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
legislative	1
branches.	1
Lastly,	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
government	1
are	1
annually	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
legislative	1
department.	1
As	1
the	1
appointment	1
to	1
offices,	1
particularly	1
executive	1
offices,	1
is	1
in	1
its	1
nature	1
an	1
executive	1
function,	1
the	1
compilers	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
have,	1
in	1
this	1
last	1
point	1
at	1
least,	1
violated	1
the	1
rule	1
established	1
by	1
themselves.	1
I	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
constitutions	1
of	1
Rhode	1
Island	1
and	1
Connecticut,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
formed	1
prior	1
to	1
the	1
Revolution,	1
and	1
even	1
before	1
the	1
principle	1
under	1
examination	1
had	1
become	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
political	1
attention.	1
The	1
constitution	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
contains	1
no	1
declaration	1
on	1
this	1
subject;	1
but	1
appears	1
very	1
clearly	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
framed	1
with	1
an	1
eye	1
to	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
improperly	1
blending	1
the	1
different	1
departments.	1
It	1
gives,	1
nevertheless,	1
to	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate,	1
a	1
partial	1
control	1
over	1
the	1
legislative	1
department;	1
and,	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
gives	1
a	1
like	1
control	1
to	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department;	1
and	1
even	1
blends	1
the	1
executive	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
this	1
control.	1
In	1
its	1
council	1
of	1
appointment	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
are	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
executive	1
authority,	1
in	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
officers,	1
both	1
executive	1
and	1
judiciary.	1
And	1
its	1
court	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
impeachments	1
and	1
correction	1
of	1
errors	1
is	1
to	1
consist	1
of	1
one	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
and	1
the	1
principal	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department.	1
The	1
constitution	1
of	1
New	1
Jersey	1
has	1
blended	1
the	1
different	1
powers	1
of	1
government	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
preceding.	1
The	1
governor,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate,	1
is	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
legislature;	1
is	1
chancellor	1
and	1
ordinary,	1
or	1
surrogate	1
of	1
the	1
State;	1
is	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
of	1
Appeals,	1
and	1
president,	1
with	1
a	1
casting	1
vote,	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
branches.	1
The	1
same	1
legislative	1
branch	1
acts	1
again	1
as	1
executive	1
council	1
of	1
the	1
governor,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
constitutes	1
the	1
Court	1
of	1
Appeals.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department	1
are	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
legislative	1
department	1
and	1
removable	1
by	1
one	1
branch	1
of	1
it,	1
on	1
the	1
impeachment	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
Pennsylvania,	1
the	1
president,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
department,	1
is	1
annually	1
elected	1
by	1
a	1
vote	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
legislative	1
department	1
predominates.	1
In	1
conjunction	1
with	1
an	1
executive	1
council,	1
he	1
appoints	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department,	1
and	1
forms	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
impeachment	1
for	1
trial	1
of	1
all	1
officers,	1
judiciary	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
executive.	1
The	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
and	1
justices	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
seem	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
removable	1
by	1
the	1
legislature;	1
and	1
the	1
executive	1
power	1
of	1
pardoning	1
in	1
certain	1
cases,	1
to	1
be	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
department.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
council	1
are	1
made	1
EX-OFFICIO	1
justices	1
of	1
peace	1
throughout	1
the	1
State.	1
In	1
Delaware,	1
the	1
chief	1
executive	1
magistrate	1
is	1
annually	1
elected	1
by	1
the	1

The	1
speakers	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
legislative	1
branches	1
are	1
vice-presidents	1
in	1
the	1
executive	1
department.	1
The	1
executive	1
chief,	1
with	1
six	1
others,	1
appointed,	1
three	1
by	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
branches	1
constitutes	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
of	1
Appeals;	1
he	1
is	1
joined	1
with	1
the	1
legislative	1
department	1
in	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
judges.	1
Throughout	1
the	1
States,	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
may	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
be	1
justices	1
of	1
the	1
peace;	1
in	1
this	1
State,	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
one	1
branch	1
of	1
it	1
are	1
EX-OFFICIO	1
justices	1
of	1
the	1
peace;	1
as	1
are	1
also	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
council.	1
The	1
principal	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
department	1
are	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
legislative;	1
and	1
one	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
forms	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
impeachments.	1
All	1
officers	1
may	1
be	1
removed	1
on	1
address	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
Maryland	1
has	1
adopted	1
the	1
maxim	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
unqualified	1
terms;	1
declaring	1
that	1
the	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judicial	1
powers	1
of	1
government	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
forever	1
separate	1
and	1
distinct	1
from	1
each	1
other.	1
Her	1
constitution,	1
notwithstanding,	1
makes	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate	1
appointable	1
by	1
the	1
legislative	1
department;	1
and	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
by	1
the	1
executive	1
department.	1
The	1
language	1
of	1
Virginia	1
is	1
still	1
more	1
pointed	1
on	1
this	1
subject.	1
Her	1
constitution	1
declares,	1
"that	1
the	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments	1
shall	1
be	1
separate	1
and	1
distinct;	1
so	1
that	1
neither	1
exercise	1
the	1
powers	1
properly	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
other;	1
nor	1
shall	1
any	1
person	1
exercise	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
justices	1
of	1
county	1
courts	1
shall	1
be	1
eligible	1
to	1
either	1
House	1
of	1
Assembly.	1
"	1
Yet	1
we	1
find	1
not	1
only	1
this	1
express	1
exception,	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
inferior	1
courts,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate,	1
with	1
his	1
executive	1
council,	1
are	1
appointable	1
by	1
the	1
legislature;	1
that	1
two	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
are	1
triennially	1
displaced	1
at	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
the	1
legislature;	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
principal	1
offices,	1
both	1
executive	1
and	1
judiciary,	1
are	1
filled	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
department.	1
The	1
executive	1
prerogative	1
of	1
pardon,	1
also,	1
is	1
in	1
one	1
case	1
vested	1
in	1
the	1
legislative	1
department.	1
The	1
constitution	1
of	1
North	1
Carolina,	1
which	1
declares	1
"that	1
the	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
supreme	1
judicial	1
powers	1
of	1
government	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
forever	1
separate	1
and	1
distinct	1
from	1
each	1
other,"	1
refers,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
to	1
the	1
legislative	1
department,	1
the	1
appointment	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
chief,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
principal	1
officers	1
within	1
both	1
that	1
and	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department.	1
In	1
South	1
Carolina,	1
the	1
constitution	1
makes	1
the	1
executive	1
magistracy	1
eligible	1
by	1
the	1
legislative	1
department.	1
It	1
gives	1
to	1
the	1
latter,	1
also,	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department,	1
including	1
even	1
justices	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
and	1
sheriffs;	1
and	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
officers	1
in	1
the	1
executive	1
department,	1
down	1
to	1
captains	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
navy	1
of	1
the	1
State.	1
In	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
Georgia,	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
declared	1
"that	1
the	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments	1
shall	1
be	1
separate	1
and	1
distinct,	1
so	1
that	1
neither	1
exercise	1
the	1
powers	1
properly	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
other,"	1
we	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
executive	1
department	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
filled	1
by	1
appointments	1
of	1
the	1
legislature;	1
and	1
the	1
executive	1
prerogative	1
of	1
pardon	1
to	1
be	1
finally	1
exercised	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
authority.	1
Even	1
justices	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
legislature.	1
In	1
citing	1
these	1
cases,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
kept	1
totally	1
separate	1
and	1
distinct,	1
I	1
wish	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
an	1
advocate	1
for	1
the	1
particular	1
organizations	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
State	1
governments.	1
I	1
am	1
fully	1
aware	1
that	1
among	1
the	1
many	1
excellent	1
principles	1
which	1
they	1
exemplify,	1
they	1
carry	1
strong	1
marks	1
of	1
the	1
haste,	1
and	1
still	1
stronger	1
of	1
the	1
inexperience,	1
under	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
framed.	1
It	1
is	1
but	1
too	1
obvious	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
instances	1
the	1
fundamental	1
principle	1
under	1
consideration	1
has	1
been	1
violated	1
by	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
mixture,	1
and	1
even	1
an	1
actual	1
consolidation,	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
powers;	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
no	1
instance	1
has	1
a	1
competent	1
provision	1
been	1
made	1
for	1
maintaining	1
in	1
practice	1
the	1
separation	1
delineated	1
on	1
paper.	1
What	1
I	1
have	1
wished	1
to	1
evince	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
charge	1
brought	1
against	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
of	1
violating	1
the	1
sacred	1
maxim	1
of	1
free	1
government,	1
is	1
warranted	1
neither	1
by	1
the	1
real	1
meaning	1
annexed	1
to	1
that	1
maxim	1
by	1
its	1
author,	1
nor	1
by	1
the	1
sense	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
hitherto	1
been	1
understood	1
in	1
America.	1
This	1
interesting	1
subject	1
will	1
be	1
resumed	1
in	1
the	1
ensuing	1
paper.	1

MADISON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
IT	1
WAS	1
shown	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
paper	1
that	1
the	1
political	1
apothegm	1
there	1
examined	1
does	1
not	1
require	1
that	1
the	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments	1
should	1
be	1
wholly	1
unconnected	1
with	1
each	1
other.	1
I	1
shall	1
undertake,	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
place,	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
unless	1
these	1
departments	1
be	1
so	1
far	1
connected	1
and	1
blended	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
each	1
a	1
constitutional	1
control	1
over	1
the	1
others,	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
separation	1
which	1
the	1
maxim	1
requires,	1
as	1
essential	1
to	1
a	1
free	1
government,	1
can	1
never	1
in	1
practice	1
be	1
duly	1
maintained.	1
It	1
is	1
agreed	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
that	1
the	1
powers	1
properly	1
belonging	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
departments	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
directly	1
and	1
completely	1
administered	1
by	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
departments.	1
It	1
is	1
equally	1
evident,	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
ought	1
to	1
possess,	1
directly	1
or	1
indirectly,	1
an	1
overruling	1
influence	1
over	1
the	1
others,	1
in	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
powers.	1
It	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
denied,	1
that	1
power	1
is	1
of	1
an	1
encroaching	1
nature,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
effectually	1
restrained	1
from	1
passing	1
the	1
limits	1
assigned	1
to	1
it.	1
After	1
discriminating,	1
therefore,	1
in	1
theory,	1
the	1
several	1
classes	1
of	1
power,	1
as	1
they	1
may	1
in	1
their	1
nature	1
be	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
or	1
judiciary,	1
the	1
next	1
and	1
most	1
difficult	1
task	1
is	1
to	1
provide	1
some	1
practical	1
security	1
for	1
each,	1
against	1
the	1
invasion	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
What	1
this	1
security	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
problem	1
to	1
be	1
solved.	1
Will	1
it	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
mark,	1
with	1
precision,	1
the	1
boundaries	1
of	1
these	1
departments,	1
in	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
to	1
trust	1
to	1
these	1
parchment	1
barriers	1
against	1
the	1
encroaching	1
spirit	1
of	1
power?	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
security	1
which	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
principally	1
relied	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
compilers	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
American	1
constitutions.	1
But	1
experience	1
assures	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
the	1
provision	1
has	1
been	1
greatly	1
overrated;	1
and	1
that	1
some	1
more	1
adequate	1
defense	1
is	1
indispensably	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
more	1
feeble,	1
against	1
the	1
more	1
powerful,	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
The	1
legislative	1
department	1
is	1
everywhere	1
extending	1
the	1
sphere	1
of	1
its	1
activity,	1
and	1
drawing	1
all	1
power	1
into	1
its	1
impetuous	1
vortex.	1
The	1
founders	1
of	1
our	1
republics	1
have	1
so	1
much	1
merit	1
for	1
the	1
wisdom	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
displayed,	1
that	1
no	1
task	1
can	1
be	1
less	1
pleasing	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
pointing	1
out	1
the	1
errors	1
into	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
fallen.	1
A	1
respect	1
for	1
truth,	1
however,	1
obliges	1
us	1
to	1
remark,	1
that	1
they	1
seem	1
never	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
have	1
turned	1
their	1
eyes	1
from	1
the	1
danger	1
to	1
liberty	1
from	1
the	1
overgrown	1
and	1
all-grasping	1
prerogative	1
of	1
an	1
hereditary	1
magistrate,	1
supported	1
and	1
fortified	1
by	1
an	1
hereditary	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority.	1
They	1
seem	1
never	1
to	1
have	1
recollected	1
the	1
danger	1
from	1
legislative	1
usurpations,	1
which,	1
by	1
assembling	1
all	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
hands,	1
must	1
lead	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
tyranny	1
as	1
is	1
threatened	1
by	1
executive	1
usurpations.	1
In	1
a	1
government	1
where	1
numerous	1
and	1
extensive	1
prerogatives	1
are	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
an	1
hereditary	1
monarch,	1
the	1
executive	1
department	1
is	1
very	1
justly	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
danger,	1
and	1
watched	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
jealousy	1
which	1
a	1
zeal	1
for	1
liberty	1
ought	1
to	1
inspire.	1
In	1
a	1
democracy,	1
where	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
people	1
exercise	1
in	1
person	1
the	1
legislative	1
functions,	1
and	1
are	1
continually	1
exposed,	1
by	1
their	1
incapacity	1
for	1
regular	1
deliberation	1
and	1
concerted	1
measures,	1
to	1
the	1
ambitious	1
intrigues	1
of	1
their	1
executive	1
magistrates,	1
tyranny	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
apprehended,	1
on	1
some	1
favorable	1
emergency,	1
to	1
start	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
quarter.	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
representative	1
republic,	1
where	1
the	1
executive	1
magistracy	1
is	1
carefully	1
limited;	1
both	1
in	1
the	1
extent	1
and	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
its	1
power;	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
legislative	1
power	1
is	1
exercised	1
by	1
an	1
assembly,	1
which	1
is	1
inspired,	1
by	1
a	1
supposed	1
influence	1
over	1
the	1
people,	1
with	1
an	1
intrepid	1
confidence	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
strength;	1
which	1
is	1
sufficiently	1
numerous	1
to	1
feel	1
all	1
the	1
passions	1
which	1
actuate	1
a	1
multitude,	1
yet	1
not	1
so	1
numerous	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
incapable	1
of	1
pursuing	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
its	1
passions,	1
by	1
means	1
which	1
reason	1
prescribes;	1
it	1
is	1
against	1
the	1
enterprising	1
ambition	1
of	1
this	1
department	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
ought	1
to	1
indulge	1
all	1
their	1
jealousy	1
and	1
exhaust	1
all	1
their	1
precautions.	1
The	1
legislative	1
department	1
derives	1
a	1
superiority	1
in	1
our	1
governments	1
from	1
other	1
circumstances.	1
Its	1
constitutional	1
powers	1
being	1
at	1
once	1
more	1
extensive,	1
and	1
less	1
susceptible	1
of	1
precise	1
limits,	1
it	1
can,	1
with	1
the	1
greater	1
facility,	1
mask,	1
under	1
complicated	1
and	1
indirect	1
measures,	1
the	1
encroachments	1
which	1
it	1
makes	1
on	1
the	1
co-ordinate	1
departments.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
unfrequently	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
real	1
nicety	1
in	1
legislative	1
bodies,	1
whether	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
a	1
particular	1
measure	1
will,	1
or	1
will	1
not,	1
extend	1
beyond	1
the	1
legislative	1
sphere.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
the	1
executive	1
power	1
being	1
restrained	1
within	1
a	1
narrower	1
compass,	1
and	1
being	1
more	1
simple	1
in	1
its	1
nature,	1
and	1
the	1
judiciary	1
being	1
described	1
by	1
landmarks	1
still	1
less	1
uncertain,	1
projects	1
of	1
usurpation	1
by	1
either	1
of	1
these	1
departments	1
would	1
immediately	1
betray	1
and	1
defeat	1
themselves.	1
Nor	1
is	1
this	1
all:	1
as	1
the	1
legislative	1
department	1
alone	1
has	1
access	1
to	1
the	1
pockets	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
has	1
in	1
some	1
constitutions	1
full	1
discretion,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
a	1
prevailing	1
influence,	1
over	1
the	1
pecuniary	1
rewards	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
fill	1
the	1
other	1
departments,	1
a	1
dependence	1
is	1
thus	1
created	1
in	1
the	1
latter,	1
which	1
gives	1
still	1
greater	1
facility	1
to	1
encroachments	1
of	1
the	1
former.	1
I	1
have	1
appealed	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
experience	1
for	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
advance	1
on	1
this	1
subject.	1
Were	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
verify	1
this	1
experience	1
by	1
particular	1
proofs,	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
multiplied	1
without	1
end.	1
I	1
might	1
find	1
a	1
witness	1
in	1
every	1
citizen	1
who	1
has	1
shared	1
in,	1
or	1
been	1
attentive	1
to,	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
public	1
administrations.	1
I	1
might	1
collect	1
vouchers	1
in	1
abundance	1
from	1
the	1
records	1
and	1
archives	1
of	1
every	1
State	1
in	1
the	1
Union.	1
But	1
as	1
a	1
more	1
concise,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
equally	1
satisfactory,	1
evidence,	1
I	1
will	1
refer	1
to	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
two	1
States,	1
attested	1
by	1
two	1
unexceptionable	1
authorities.	1
The	1
first	1
example	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
Virginia,	1
a	1
State	1
which,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
has	1
expressly	1
declared	1
in	1
its	1
constitution,	1
that	1
the	1
three	1
great	1
departments	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
intermixed.	1
The	1
authority	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
Mr.	1
Jefferson,	1
who,	1
besides	1
his	1
other	1
advantages	1
for	1
remarking	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
was	1
himself	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate	1
of	1
it.	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
convey	1
fully	1
the	1
ideas	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
experience	1
had	1
impressed	1
him	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
quote	1
a	1
passage	1
of	1
some	1
length	1
from	1
his	1
very	1
interesting	1
"Notes	1
on	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
Virginia,"	1
p.	1
195.	1
"All	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
government,	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judiciary,	1
result	1
to	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
The	1
concentrating	1
these	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
hands,	1
is	1
precisely	1
the	1
definition	1
of	1
despotic	1
government.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
alleviation,	1
that	1
these	1
powers	1
will	1
be	1
exercised	1
by	1
a	1
plurality	1
of	1
hands,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
one.	1
One	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy-three	1
despots	1
would	1
surely	1
be	1
as	1
oppressive	1
as	1
one.	1
Let	1
those	1
who	1
doubt	1
it,	1
turn	1
their	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
republic	1
of	1
Venice.	1
As	1
little	1
will	1
it	1
avail	1
us,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
chosen	1
by	1
ourselves.	1
An	1
ELECTIVE	1
DESPOTISM	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
government	1
we	1
fought	1
for;	1
but	1
one	1
which	1
should	1
not	1
only	1
be	1
founded	1
on	1
free	1
principles,	1
but	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
government	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
divided	1
and	1
balanced	1
among	1
several	1
bodies	1
of	1
magistracy,	1
as	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
transcend	1
their	1
legal	1
limits,	1
without	1
being	1
effectually	1
checked	1
and	1
restrained	1
by	1
the	1
others.	1
For	1
this	1
reason,	1
that	1
convention	1
which	1
passed	1
the	1
ordinance	1
of	1
government,	1
laid	1
its	1
foundation	1
on	1
this	1
basis,	1
that	1
the	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments	1
should	1
be	1
separate	1
and	1
distinct,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
person	1
should	1
exercise	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
BUT	1
NO	1
BARRIER	1
WAS	1
PROVIDED	1
BETWEEN	1
THESE	1
SEVERAL	1
POWERS.	1
The	1
judiciary	1
and	1
the	1
executive	1
members	1
were	1
left	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
legislative	1
for	1
their	1
subsistence	1
in	1
office,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
continuance	1
in	1
it.	1
If,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
legislature	1
assumes	1
executive	1
and	1
judiciary	1
powers,	1
no	1
opposition	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
made;	1
nor,	1
if	1
made,	1
can	1
be	1
effectual;	1
because	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
they	1
may	1
put	1
their	1
proceedings	1
into	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
acts	1
of	1
Assembly,	1
which	1
will	1
render	1
them	1
obligatory	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
branches.	1
They	1
have	1
accordingly,	1
IN	1
MANY	1
instances,	1
DECIDED	1
RIGHTS	1
which	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
left	1
to	1
JUDICIARY	1
CONTROVERSY,	1
and	1
THE	1
DIRECTION	1
OF	1
THE	1
EXECUTIVE,	1
DURING	1
THE	1
WHOLE	1
TIME	1
OF	1
THEIR	1
SESSION,	1
IS	1
BECOMING	1
HABITUAL	1
AND	1
FAMILIAR.	1
"The	1
other	1
State	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
for	1
an	1
example	1
is	1
Pennsylvania;	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
authority,	1
the	1
Council	1
of	1
Censors,	1
which	1
assembled	1
in	1
the	1
years	1
1783	1
and	1
1784.	1
A	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
this	1
body,	1
as	1
marked	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
constitution,	1
was	1
"to	1
inquire	1
whether	1
the	1
constitution	1
had	1
been	1
preserved	1
inviolate	1
in	1
every	1
part;	1
and	1
whether	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
executive	1
branches	1
of	1
government	1
had	1
performed	1
their	1
duty	1
as	1
guardians	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
or	1
assumed	1
to	1
themselves,	1
or	1
exercised,	1
other	1
or	1
greater	1
powers	1
than	1
they	1
are	1
entitled	1
to	1
by	1
the	1
constitution.	1
"	1
In	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
this	1
trust,	1
the	1
council	1
were	1
necessarily	1
led	1
to	1
a	1
comparison	1
of	1
both	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
executive	1
proceedings,	1
with	1
the	1
constitutional	1
powers	1
of	1
these	1
departments;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
facts	1
enumerated,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
which	1
both	1
sides	1
in	1
the	1
council	1
subscribed,	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
the	1
constitution	1
had	1
been	1
flagrantly	1
violated	1
by	1
the	1
legislature	1
in	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
important	1
instances.	1
A	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
laws	1
had	1
been	1
passed,	1
violating,	1
without	1
any	1
apparent	1
necessity,	1
the	1
rule	1
requiring	1
that	1
all	1
bills	1
of	1
a	1
public	1
nature	1
shall	1
be	1
previously	1
printed	1
for	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
although	1
this	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
precautions	1
chiefly	1
relied	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
constitution	1
against	1
improper	1
acts	1
of	1
legislature.	1
The	1
constitutional	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
had	1
been	1
violated,	1
and	1
powers	1
assumed	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
delegated	1
by	1
the	1
constitution.	1
Executive	1
powers	1
had	1
been	1
usurped.	1
The	1
salaries	1
of	1
the	1
judges,	1
which	1
the	1
constitution	1
expressly	1
requires	1
to	1
be	1
fixed,	1
had	1
been	1
occasionally	1
varied;	1
and	1
cases	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department	1
frequently	1
drawn	1
within	1
legislative	1
cognizance	1
and	1
determination.	1
Those	1
who	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
several	1
particulars	1
falling	1
under	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
heads,	1
may	1
consult	1
the	1
journals	1
of	1
the	1
council,	1
which	1
are	1
in	1
print.	1
Some	1
of	1
them,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found,	1
may	1
be	1
imputable	1
to	1
peculiar	1
circumstances	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
war;	1
but	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
the	1
spontaneous	1
shoots	1
of	1
an	1
ill-constituted	1
government.	1
It	1
appears,	1
also,	1
that	1
the	1
executive	1
department	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
innocent	1
of	1
frequent	1
breaches	1
of	1
the	1
constitution.	1
There	1
are	1
three	1
observations,	1
however,	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
on	1
this	1
head:	1
FIRST,	1
a	1
great	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
instances	1
were	1
either	1
immediately	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
necessities	1
of	1
the	1
war,	1
or	1
recommended	1
by	1
Congress	1
or	1
the	1
commander-in-chief;	1
SECONDLY,	1
in	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
instances,	1
they	1
conformed	1
either	1
to	1
the	1
declared	1
or	1
the	1
known	1
sentiments	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
department;	1
THIRDLY,	1
the	1
executive	1
department	1
of	1
Pennsylvania	1
is	1
distinguished	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
States	1
by	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
members	1
composing	1
it.	1
In	1
this	1
respect,	1
it	1
has	1
as	1
much	1
affinity	1
to	1
a	1
legislative	1
assembly	1
as	1
to	1
an	1
executive	1
council.	1
And	1
being	1
at	1
once	1
exempt	1
from	1
the	1
restraint	1
of	1
an	1
individual	1
responsibility	1
for	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
deriving	1
confidence	1
from	1
mutual	1
example	1
and	1
joint	1
influence,	1
unauthorized	1
measures	1
would,	1
of	1
course,	1
be	1
more	1
freely	1
hazarded,	1
than	1
where	1
the	1
executive	1
department	1
is	1
administered	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
hand,	1
or	1
by	1
a	1
few	1
hands.	1
The	1
conclusion	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
warranted	1
in	1
drawing	1
from	1
these	1
observations	1
is,	1
that	1
a	1
mere	1
demarcation	1
on	1
parchment	1
of	1
the	1
constitutional	1
limits	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
departments,	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
sufficient	1
guard	1
against	1
those	1
encroachments	1
which	1
lead	1
to	1
a	1
tyrannical	1
concentration	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
government	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
hands.	1

To	1

New	1
York:	1
THE	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
"Notes	1
on	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
Virginia,"	1
quoted	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
paper,	1
has	1
subjoined	1
to	1
that	1
valuable	1
work	1
the	1
draught	1
of	1
a	1
constitution,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
prepared	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
laid	1
before	1
a	1
convention,	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
in	1
1783,	1
by	1
the	1
legislature,	1
for	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
a	1
constitution	1
for	1
that	1
commonwealth.	1
The	1
plan,	1
like	1
every	1
thing	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
pen,	1
marks	1
a	1
turn	1
of	1
thinking,	1
original,	1
comprehensive,	1
and	1
accurate;	1
and	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
worthy	1
of	1
attention	1
as	1
it	1
equally	1
displays	1
a	1
fervent	1
attachment	1
to	1
republican	1
government	1
and	1
an	1
enlightened	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
dangerous	1
propensities	1
against	1
which	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
guarded.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
precautions	1
which	1
he	1
proposes,	1
and	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
appears	1
ultimately	1
to	1
rely	1
as	1
a	1
palladium	1
to	1
the	1
weaker	1
departments	1
of	1
power	1
against	1
the	1
invasions	1
of	1
the	1
stronger,	1
is	1
perhaps	1
altogether	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
immediately	1
relates	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
our	1
present	1
inquiry,	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
overlooked.	1
His	1
proposition	1
is,	1
"that	1
whenever	1
any	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
branches	1
of	1
government	1
shall	1
concur	1
in	1
opinion,	1
each	1
by	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
their	1
whole	1
number,	1
that	1
a	1
convention	1
is	1
necessary	1
for	1
altering	1
the	1
constitution,	1
or	1
CORRECTING	1
BREACHES	1
OF	1
IT,	1
a	1
convention	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
purpose.	1
"As	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
legitimate	1
fountain	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
from	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
constitutional	1
charter,	1
under	1
which	1
the	1
several	1
branches	1
of	1
government	1
hold	1
their	1
power,	1
is	1
derived,	1
it	1
seems	1
strictly	1
consonant	1
to	1
the	1
republican	1
theory,	1
to	1
recur	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
original	1
authority,	1
not	1
only	1
whenever	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
enlarge,	1
diminish,	1
or	1
new-model	1
the	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
but	1
also	1
whenever	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
departments	1
may	1
commit	1
encroachments	1
on	1
the	1
chartered	1
authorities	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
The	1
several	1
departments	1
being	1
perfectly	1
co-ordinate	1
by	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
their	1
common	1
commission,	1
none	1
of	1
them,	1
it	1
is	1
evident,	1
can	1
pretend	1
to	1
an	1
exclusive	1
or	1
superior	1
right	1
of	1
settling	1
the	1
boundaries	1
between	1
their	1
respective	1
powers;	1
and	1
how	1
are	1
the	1
encroachments	1
of	1
the	1
stronger	1
to	1
be	1
prevented,	1
or	1
the	1
wrongs	1
of	1
the	1
weaker	1
to	1
be	1
redressed,	1
without	1
an	1
appeal	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
themselves,	1
who,	1
as	1
the	1
grantors	1
of	1
the	1
commissions,	1
can	1
alone	1
declare	1
its	1
true	1
meaning,	1
and	1
enforce	1
its	1
observance?	1
There	1
is	1
certainly	1
great	1
force	1
in	1
this	1
reasoning,	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
a	1
constitutional	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
decision	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
marked	1
out	1
and	1
kept	1
open,	1
for	1
certain	1
great	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
occasions.	1
But	1
there	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
insuperable	1
objections	1
against	1
the	1
proposed	1
recurrence	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
as	1
a	1
provision	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
for	1
keeping	1
the	1
several	1
departments	1
of	1
power	1
within	1
their	1
constitutional	1
limits.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
the	1
provision	1
does	1
not	1
reach	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
departments	1
against	1
the	1
third.	1
If	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority,	1
which	1
possesses	1
so	1
many	1
means	1
of	1
operating	1
on	1
the	1
motives	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
departments,	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
gain	1
to	1
its	1
interest	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
or	1
even	1
one	1
third	1
of	1
its	1
members,	1
the	1
remaining	1
department	1
could	1
derive	1
no	1
advantage	1
from	1
its	1
remedial	1
provision.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
dwell,	1
however,	1
on	1
this	1
objection,	1
because	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
rather	1
against	1
the	1
modification	1
of	1
the	1
principle,	1
than	1
against	1
the	1
principle	1
itself.	1
In	1
the	1
next	1
place,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
an	1
objection	1
inherent	1
in	1
the	1
principle,	1
that	1
as	1
every	1
appeal	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
would	1
carry	1
an	1
implication	1
of	1
some	1
defect	1
in	1
the	1
government,	1
frequent	1
appeals	1
would,	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure,	1
deprive	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
that	1
veneration	1
which	1
time	1
bestows	1
on	1
every	1
thing,	1
and	1
without	1
which	1
perhaps	1
the	1
wisest	1
and	1
freest	1
governments	1
would	1
not	1
possess	1
the	1
requisite	1
stability.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
true	1
that	1
all	1
governments	1
rest	1
on	1
opinion,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
less	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
opinion	1
in	1
each	1
individual,	1
and	1
its	1
practical	1
influence	1
on	1
his	1
conduct,	1
depend	1
much	1
on	1
the	1
number	1
which	1
he	1
supposes	1
to	1
have	1
entertained	1
the	1
same	1
opinion.	1
The	1
reason	1
of	1
man,	1
like	1
man	1
himself,	1
is	1
timid	1
and	1
cautious	1
when	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
acquires	1
firmness	1
and	1
confidence	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
associated.	1
When	1
the	1
examples	1
which	1
fortify	1
opinion	1
are	1
ANCIENT	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
NUMEROUS,	1
they	1
are	1
known	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
double	1
effect.	1
In	1
a	1
nation	1
of	1
philosophers,	1
this	1
consideration	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
disregarded.	1
A	1
reverence	1
for	1
the	1
laws	1
would	1
be	1
sufficiently	1
inculcated	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
an	1
enlightened	1
reason.	1
But	1
a	1
nation	1
of	1
philosophers	1
is	1
as	1
little	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
as	1
the	1
philosophical	1
race	1
of	1
kings	1
wished	1
for	1
by	1
Plato.	1
And	1
in	1
every	1
other	1
nation,	1
the	1
most	1
rational	1
government	1
will	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
a	1
superfluous	1
advantage	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
prejudices	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
on	1
its	1
side.	1
The	1
danger	1
of	1
disturbing	1
the	1
public	1
tranquillity	1
by	1
interesting	1
too	1
strongly	1
the	1
public	1
passions,	1
is	1
a	1
still	1
more	1
serious	1
objection	1
against	1
a	1
frequent	1
reference	1
of	1
constitutional	1
questions	1
to	1
the	1
decision	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
society.	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
success	1
which	1
has	1
attended	1
the	1
revisions	1
of	1
our	1
established	1
forms	1
of	1
government,	1
and	1
which	1
does	1
so	1
much	1
honor	1
to	1
the	1
virtue	1
and	1
intelligence	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
confessed	1
that	1
the	1
experiments	1
are	1
of	1
too	1
ticklish	1
a	1
nature	1
to	1
be	1
unnecessarily	1
multiplied.	1
We	1
are	1
to	1
recollect	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
existing	1
constitutions	1
were	1
formed	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
danger	1
which	1
repressed	1
the	1
passions	1
most	1
unfriendly	1
to	1
order	1
and	1
concord;	1
of	1
an	1
enthusiastic	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
patriotic	1
leaders,	1
which	1
stifled	1
the	1
ordinary	1
diversity	1
of	1
opinions	1
on	1
great	1
national	1
questions;	1
of	1
a	1
universal	1
ardor	1
for	1
new	1
and	1
opposite	1
forms,	1
produced	1
by	1
a	1
universal	1
resentment	1
and	1
indignation	1
against	1
the	1
ancient	1
government;	1
and	1
whilst	1
no	1
spirit	1
of	1
party	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
changes	1
to	1
be	1
made,	1
or	1
the	1
abuses	1
to	1
be	1
reformed,	1
could	1
mingle	1
its	1
leaven	1
in	1
the	1
operation.	1
The	1
future	1
situations	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
must	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
usually	1
placed,	1
do	1
not	1
present	1
any	1
equivalent	1
security	1
against	1
the	1
danger	1
which	1
is	1
apprehended.	1
But	1
the	1
greatest	1
objection	1
of	1
all	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
decisions	1
which	1
would	1
probably	1
result	1
from	1
such	1
appeals	1
would	1
not	1
answer	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
maintaining	1
the	1
constitutional	1
equilibrium	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
the	1
tendency	1
of	1
republican	1
governments	1
is	1
to	1
an	1
aggrandizement	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
departments.	1
The	1
appeals	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
therefore,	1
would	1
usually	1
be	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
executive	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments.	1
But	1
whether	1
made	1
by	1
one	1
side	1
or	1
the	1
other,	1
would	1
each	1
side	1
enjoy	1
equal	1
advantages	1
on	1
the	1
trial?	1
Let	1
us	1
view	1
their	1
different	1
situations.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments	1
are	1
few	1
in	1
number,	1
and	1
can	1
be	1
personally	1
known	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
part	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
The	1
latter,	1
by	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
their	1
appointment,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
nature	1
and	1
permanency	1
of	1
it,	1
are	1
too	1
far	1
removed	1
from	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
share	1
much	1
in	1
their	1
prepossessions.	1
The	1
former	1
are	1
generally	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
jealousy,	1
and	1
their	1
administration	1
is	1
always	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
discolored	1
and	1
rendered	1
unpopular.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
department,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
are	1
numberous.	1
They	1
are	1
distributed	1
and	1
dwell	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large.	1
Their	1
connections	1
of	1
blood,	1
of	1
friendship,	1
and	1
of	1
acquaintance	1
embrace	1
a	1
great	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
influential	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
society.	1
The	1
nature	1
of	1
their	1
public	1
trust	1
implies	1
a	1
personal	1
influence	1
among	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
immediately	1
the	1
confidential	1
guardians	1
of	1
the	1
rights	1
and	1
liberties	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
With	1
these	1
advantages,	1
it	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
adverse	1
party	1
would	1
have	1
an	1
equal	1
chance	1
for	1
a	1
favorable	1
issue.	1
But	1
the	1
legislative	1
party	1
would	1
not	1
only	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
plead	1
their	1
cause	1
most	1
successfully	1
with	1
the	1
people.	1
They	1
would	1
probably	1
be	1
constituted	1
themselves	1
the	1
judges.	1
The	1
same	1
influence	1
which	1
had	1
gained	1
them	1
an	1
election	1
into	1
the	1
legislature,	1
would	1
gain	1
them	1
a	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
convention.	1
If	1
this	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
all,	1
it	1
would	1
probably	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
many,	1
and	1
pretty	1
certainly	1
with	1
those	1
leading	1
characters,	1
on	1
whom	1
every	1
thing	1
depends	1
in	1
such	1
bodies.	1
The	1
convention,	1
in	1
short,	1
would	1
be	1
composed	1
chiefly	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been,	1
who	1
actually	1
were,	1
or	1
who	1
expected	1
to	1
be,	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
department	1
whose	1
conduct	1
was	1
arraigned.	1
They	1
would	1
consequently	1
be	1
parties	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
question	1
to	1
be	1
decided	1
by	1
them.	1
It	1
might,	1
however,	1
sometimes	1
happen,	1
that	1
appeals	1
would	1
be	1
made	1
under	1
circumstances	1
less	1
adverse	1
to	1
the	1
executive	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments.	1
The	1
usurpations	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
might	1
be	1
so	1
flagrant	1
and	1
so	1
sudden,	1
as	1
to	1
admit	1
of	1
no	1
specious	1
coloring.	1
A	1
strong	1
party	1
among	1
themselves	1
might	1
take	1
side	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
branches.	1
The	1
executive	1
power	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
peculiar	1
favorite	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
In	1
such	1
a	1
posture	1
of	1
things,	1
the	1
public	1
decision	1
might	1
be	1
less	1
swayed	1
by	1
prepossessions	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
party.	1
But	1
still	1
it	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
turn	1
on	1
the	1
true	1
merits	1
of	1
the	1
question.	1
It	1
would	1
inevitably	1
be	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
pre-existing	1
parties,	1
or	1
of	1
parties	1
springing	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
itself.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
connected	1
with	1
persons	1
of	1
distinguished	1
character	1
and	1
extensive	1
influence	1
in	1
the	1
community.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
pronounced	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
agents	1
in,	1
or	1
opponents	1
of,	1
the	1
measures	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
decision	1
would	1
relate.	1
The	1
PASSIONS,	1
therefore,	1
not	1
the	1
REASON,	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
would	1
sit	1
in	1
judgment.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
reason,	1
alone,	1
of	1
the	1
public,	1
that	1
ought	1
to	1
control	1
and	1
regulate	1
the	1
government.	1
The	1
passions	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
controlled	1
and	1
regulated	1
by	1
the	1
government.	1
We	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
paper,	1
that	1
mere	1
declarations	1
in	1
the	1
written	1
constitution	1
are	1
not	1
sufficient	1
to	1
restrain	1
the	1
several	1
departments	1
within	1
their	1
legal	1
rights.	1
It	1
appears	1
in	1
this,	1
that	1
occasional	1
appeals	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
would	1
be	1
neither	1
a	1
proper	1
nor	1
an	1
effectual	1
provision	1
for	1
that	1
purpose.	1
How	1
far	1
the	1
provisions	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
nature	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
above	1
quoted	1
might	1
be	1
adequate,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
examine.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
unquestionably	1
founded	1
on	1
sound	1
political	1
principles,	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
framed	1
with	1
singular	1
ingenuity	1
and	1
precision.	1

perhaps,	1

which	1
are	1
liable	1
to	1
the	1
objections	1
urged	1
against	1

PERIODICAL	1
appeals	1
are	1
the	1
proper	1
and	1
adequate	1
means	1
of	1
PREVENTING	1
AND	1
CORRECTING	1
INFRACTIONS	1
OF	1
THE	1
CONSTITUTION.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
attended	1
to,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
examination	1
of	1
these	1
expedients,	1
I	1
confine	1
myself	1
to	1
their	1
aptitude	1
for	1
ENFORCING	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
by	1
keeping	1
the	1
several	1
departments	1
of	1
power	1
within	1
their	1
due	1
bounds,	1
without	1
particularly	1
considering	1
them	1
as	1
provisions	1
for	1
ALTERING	1
the	1
Constitution	1
itself.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
view,	1
appeals	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
fixed	1
periods	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
nearly	1
as	1
ineligible	1
as	1
appeals	1
on	1
particular	1
occasions	1
as	1
they	1
emerge.	1
If	1
the	1
periods	1
be	1
separated	1
by	1
short	1
intervals,	1
the	1
measures	1
to	1
be	1
reviewed	1
and	1
rectified	1
will	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
recent	1
date,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
connected	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
circumstances	1
which	1
tend	1
to	1
vitiate	1
and	1
pervert	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
occasional	1
revisions.	1
If	1
the	1
periods	1
be	1
distant	1
from	1
each	1
other,	1
the	1
same	1
remark	1
will	1
be	1
applicable	1
to	1
all	1
recent	1
measures;	1
and	1
in	1
proportion	1
as	1
the	1
remoteness	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
may	1
favor	1
a	1
dispassionate	1
review	1
of	1
them,	1
this	1
advantage	1
is	1
inseparable	1
from	1
inconveniences	1
which	1
seem	1
to	1
counterbalance	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
a	1
distant	1
prospect	1
of	1
public	1
censure	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
feeble	1
restraint	1
on	1
power	1
from	1
those	1
excesses	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
urged	1
by	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
present	1
motives.	1
Is	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
imagined	1
that	1
a	1
legislative	1
assembly,	1
consisting	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
or	1
two	1
hundred	1
members,	1
eagerly	1
bent	1
on	1
some	1
favorite	1
object,	1
and	1
breaking	1
through	1
the	1
restraints	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
it,	1
would	1
be	1
arrested	1
in	1
their	1
career,	1
by	1
considerations	1
drawn	1
from	1
a	1
censorial	1
revision	1
of	1
their	1
conduct	1
at	1
the	1
future	1
distance	1
of	1
ten,	1
fifteen,	1
or	1
twenty	1
years?	1
In	1
the	1
next	1
place,	1
the	1
abuses	1
would	1
often	1
have	1
completed	1
their	1
mischievous	1
effects	1
before	1
the	1
remedial	1
provision	1
would	1
be	1
applied.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
place,	1
where	1
this	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
long	1
standing,	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
deep	1
root,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
easily	1
be	1
extirpated.	1
The	1
scheme	1
of	1
revising	1
the	1
constitution,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
correct	1
recent	1
breaches	1
of	1
it,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
for	1
other	1
purposes,	1
has	1
been	1
actually	1
tried	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
the	1
Council	1
of	1
Censors	1
which	1
met	1
in	1
Pennsylvania	1
in	1
1783	1
and	1
1784,	1
was,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
to	1
inquire,	1
"whether	1
the	1
constitution	1
had	1
been	1
violated,	1
and	1
whether	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
executive	1
departments	1
had	1
encroached	1
upon	1
each	1
other.	1
"	1
This	1
important	1
and	1
novel	1
experiment	1
in	1
politics	1
merits,	1
in	1
several	1
points	1
of	1
view,	1
very	1
particular	1
attention.	1
In	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
it	1
may,	1
perhaps,	1
as	1
a	1
single	1
experiment,	1
made	1
under	1
circumstances	1
somewhat	1
peculiar,	1
be	1
thought	1
to	1
be	1
not	1
absolutely	1
conclusive.	1
But	1
as	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
case	1
under	1
consideration,	1
it	1
involves	1
some	1
facts,	1
which	1
I	1
venture	1
to	1
remark,	1
as	1
a	1
complete	1
and	1
satisfactory	1
illustration	1
of	1
the	1
reasoning	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
employed.	1
First.	1
It	1
appears,	1
from	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
composed	1
the	1
council,	1
that	1
some,	1
at	1
least,	1
of	1
its	1
most	1
active	1
members	1
had	1
also	1
been	1
active	1
and	1
leading	1
characters	1
in	1
the	1
parties	1
which	1
pre-existed	1
in	1
the	1
State.	1
Secondly.	1
It	1
appears	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
active	1
and	1
leading	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
had	1
been	1
active	1
and	1
influential	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
executive	1
branches,	1
within	1
the	1
period	1
to	1
be	1
reviewed;	1
and	1
even	1
patrons	1
or	1
opponents	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
measures	1
to	1
be	1
thus	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
test	1
of	1
the	1
constitution.	1
Two	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
had	1
been	1
vice-presidents	1
of	1
the	1
State,	1
and	1
several	1
other	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
council,	1
within	1
the	1
seven	1
preceding	1
years.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
been	1
speaker,	1
and	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
others	1
distinguished	1
members,	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
assembly	1
within	1
the	1
same	1
period.	1
Thirdly.	1
Every	1
page	1
of	1
their	1
proceedings	1
witnesses	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
circumstances	1
on	1
the	1
temper	1
of	1
their	1
deliberations.	1
Throughout	1
the	1
continuance	1
of	1
the	1
council,	1
it	1
was	1
split	1
into	1
two	1
fixed	1
and	1
violent	1
parties.	1
The	1
fact	1
is	1
acknowledged	1
and	1
lamented	1
by	1
themselves.	1
Had	1
this	1
not	1
been	1
the	1
case,	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
their	1
proceedings	1
exhibits	1
a	1
proof	1
equally	1
satisfactory.	1
In	1
all	1
questions,	1
however	1
unimportant	1
in	1
themselves,	1
or	1
unconnected	1
with	1
each	1
other,	1
the	1
same	1
names	1
stand	1
invariably	1
contrasted	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
columns.	1
Every	1
unbiased	1
observer	1
may	1
infer,	1
without	1
danger	1
of	1
mistake,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
without	1
meaning	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
either	1
party,	1
or	1
any	1
individuals	1
of	1
either	1
party,	1
that,	1
unfortunately,	1
PASSION,	1
not	1
REASON,	1
must	1
have	1
presided	1
over	1
their	1
decisions.	1
When	1
men	1
exercise	1
their	1
reason	1
coolly	1
and	1
freely	1
on	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
distinct	1
questions,	1
they	1
inevitably	1
fall	1
into	1
different	1
opinions	1
on	1
some	1
of	1
them.	1
When	1
they	1
are	1
governed	1
by	1
a	1
common	1
passion,	1
their	1
opinions,	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
to	1
be	1
called,	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
same.	1
Fourthly.	1
It	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
problematical,	1
whether	1
the	1
decisions	1
of	1
this	1
body	1
do	1
not,	1
in	1
several	1
instances,	1
misconstrue	1
the	1
limits	1
prescribed	1
for	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
executive	1
departments,	1
instead	1
of	1
reducing	1
and	1
limiting	1
them	1
within	1
their	1
constitutional	1
places.	1
Fifthly.	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
decisions	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
on	1
constitutional	1
questions,	1
whether	1
rightly	1
or	1
erroneously	1
formed,	1
have	1
had	1
any	1
effect	1
in	1
varying	1
the	1
practice	1
founded	1
on	1
legislative	1
constructions.	1
It	1
even	1
appears,	1
if	1
I	1
mistake	1
not,	1
that	1
in	1
one	1
instance	1
the	1
contemporary	1
legislature	1
denied	1
the	1
constructions	1
of	1
the	1
council,	1
and	1
actually	1
prevailed	1
in	1
the	1
contest.	1
This	1
censorial	1
body,	1
therefore,	1
proves	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
by	1
its	1
researches,	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
disease,	1
and	1
by	1
its	1
example,	1
the	1
inefficacy	1
of	1
the	1
remedy.	1
This	1
conclusion	1
cannot	1
be	1
invalidated	1
by	1
alleging	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
experiment	1
was	1
made	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
crisis,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before,	1
violently	1
heated	1
and	1
distracted	1
by	1
the	1
rage	1
of	1
party.	1
Is	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
presumed,	1
that	1
at	1
any	1
future	1
septennial	1
epoch	1
the	1
same	1
State	1
will	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
parties?	1
Is	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
presumed	1
that	1
any	1
other	1
State,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
given	1
period,	1
will	1
be	1
exempt	1
from	1
them?	1
Such	1
an	1
event	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
neither	1
presumed	1
nor	1
desired;	1
because	1
an	1
extinction	1
of	1
parties	1
necessarily	1
implies	1
either	1
a	1
universal	1
alarm	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
safety,	1
or	1
an	1
absolute	1
extinction	1
of	1
liberty.	1
Were	1
the	1
precaution	1
taken	1
of	1
excluding	1
from	1
the	1
assemblies	1
elected	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
to	1
revise	1
the	1
preceding	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
all	1
persons	1
who	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
concerned	1
with	1
the	1
government	1
within	1
the	1
given	1
period,	1
the	1
difficulties	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
obviated.	1
The	1
important	1
task	1
would	1
probably	1
devolve	1
on	1
men,	1
who,	1
with	1
inferior	1
capacities,	1
would	1
in	1
other	1
respects	1
be	1
little	1
better	1
qualified.	1
Although	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
personally	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
administration,	1
and	1
therefore	1
not	1
immediately	1
agents	1
in	1
the	1
measures	1
to	1
be	1
examined,	1
they	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
been	1
involved	1
in	1
the	1
parties	1
connected	1
with	1
these	1
measures,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
elected	1
under	1
their	1
auspices.	1

HAMILTON	1
OR	1
MADISON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
TO	1
WHAT	1
expedient,	1
then,	1
shall	1
we	1
finally	1
resort,	1
for	1
maintaining	1
in	1
practice	1
the	1
necessary	1
partition	1
of	1
power	1
among	1
the	1
several	1
departments,	1
as	1
laid	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution?	1
The	1
only	1
answer	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
given	1
is,	1
that	1
as	1
all	1
these	1
exterior	1
provisions	1
are	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
inadequate,	1
the	1
defect	1
must	1
be	1
supplied,	1
by	1
so	1
contriving	1
the	1
interior	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
as	1
that	1
its	1
several	1
constituent	1
parts	1
may,	1
by	1
their	1
mutual	1
relations,	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
keeping	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
their	1
proper	1
places.	1
Without	1
presuming	1
to	1
undertake	1
a	1
full	1
development	1
of	1
this	1
important	1
idea,	1
I	1
will	1
hazard	1
a	1
few	1
general	1
observations,	1
which	1
may	1
perhaps	1
place	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
clearer	1
light,	1
and	1
enable	1
us	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
more	1
correct	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
principles	1
and	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
planned	1
by	1
the	1
convention.	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
lay	1
a	1
due	1
foundation	1
for	1
that	1
separate	1
and	1
distinct	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
powers	1
of	1
government,	1
which	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
extent	1
is	1
admitted	1
on	1
all	1
hands	1
to	1
be	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
liberty,	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
each	1
department	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
will	1
of	1
its	1
own;	1
and	1
consequently	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
constituted	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
each	1
should	1
have	1
as	1
little	1
agency	1
as	1
possible	1
in	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
Were	1
this	1
principle	1
rigorously	1
adhered	1
to,	1
it	1
would	1
require	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
appointments	1
for	1
the	1
supreme	1
executive,	1
legislative,	1
and	1
judiciary	1
magistracies	1
should	1
be	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
fountain	1
of	1
authority,	1
the	1
people,	1
through	1
channels	1
having	1
no	1
communication	1
whatever	1
with	1
one	1
another.	1
Perhaps	1
such	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
constructing	1
the	1
several	1
departments	1
would	1
be	1
less	1
difficult	1
in	1
practice	1
than	1
it	1
may	1
in	1
contemplation	1
appear.	1
Some	1
difficulties,	1
however,	1
and	1
some	1
additional	1
expense	1
would	1
attend	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
it.	1
Some	1
deviations,	1
therefore,	1
from	1
the	1
principle	1
must	1
be	1
admitted.	1
In	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department	1
in	1
particular,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
inexpedient	1
to	1
insist	1
rigorously	1
on	1
the	1
principle:	1
first,	1
because	1
peculiar	1
qualifications	1
being	1
essential	1
in	1
the	1
members,	1
the	1
primary	1
consideration	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
to	1
select	1
that	1
mode	1
of	1
choice	1
which	1
best	1
secures	1
these	1
qualifications;	1
secondly,	1
because	1
the	1
permanent	1
tenure	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
appointments	1
are	1
held	1
in	1
that	1
department,	1
must	1
soon	1
destroy	1
all	1
sense	1
of	1
dependence	1
on	1
the	1
authority	1
conferring	1
them.	1
It	1
is	1
equally	1
evident,	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
each	1
department	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
little	1
dependent	1
as	1
possible	1
on	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
for	1
the	1
emoluments	1
annexed	1
to	1
their	1
offices.	1
Were	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate,	1
or	1
the	1
judges,	1
not	1
independent	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
their	1
independence	1
in	1
every	1
other	1
would	1
be	1
merely	1
nominal.	1
But	1
the	1
great	1
security	1
against	1
a	1
gradual	1
concentration	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
powers	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
department,	1
consists	1
in	1
giving	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
administer	1
each	1
department	1
the	1
necessary	1
constitutional	1
means	1
and	1
personal	1
motives	1
to	1
resist	1
encroachments	1
of	1
the	1
others.	1
The	1
provision	1
for	1
defense	1
must	1
in	1
this,	1
as	1
in	1
all	1
other	1
cases,	1
be	1
made	1
commensurate	1
to	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
attack.	1
Ambition	1
must	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
counteract	1
ambition.	1
The	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
constitutional	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
place.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
reflection	1
on	1
human	1
nature,	1
that	1
such	1
devices	1
should	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
control	1
the	1
abuses	1
of	1
government.	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
government	1
itself,	1
but	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
all	1
reflections	1
on	1
human	1
nature?	1
If	1
men	1
were	1
angels,	1
no	1
government	1
would	1
be	1
necessary.	1
If	1
angels	1
were	1
to	1
govern	1
men,	1
neither	1
external	1
nor	1
internal	1
controls	1
on	1
government	1
would	1
be	1
necessary.	1
In	1
framing	1
a	1
government	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
administered	1
by	1
men	1
over	1
men,	1
the	1
great	1
difficulty	1
lies	1
in	1
this:	1
you	1
must	1
first	1
enable	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
control	1
the	1
governed;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
place	1
oblige	1
it	1
to	1
control	1
itself.	1
A	1
dependence	1
on	1
the	1
people	1
is,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
the	1
primary	1
control	1
on	1
the	1
government;	1
but	1
experience	1
has	1
taught	1
mankind	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
auxiliary	1
precautions.	1
This	1
policy	1
of	1
supplying,	1
by	1
opposite	1
and	1
rival	1
interests,	1
the	1
defect	1
of	1
better	1
motives,	1
might	1
be	1
traced	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
system	1
of	1
human	1
affairs,	1
private	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
public.	1
We	1
see	1
it	1
particularly	1
displayed	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
subordinate	1
distributions	1
of	1
power,	1
where	1
the	1
constant	1
aim	1
is	1
to	1
divide	1
and	1
arrange	1
the	1
several	1
offices	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
that	1
each	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
check	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
the	1
private	1
interest	1
of	1
every	1
individual	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
sentinel	1
over	1
the	1
public	1
rights.	1
These	1
inventions	1
of	1
prudence	1
cannot	1
be	1
less	1
requisite	1
in	1
the	1
distribution	1
of	1
the	1
supreme	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
State.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
possible	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
each	1
department	1
an	1
equal	1
power	1
of	1
self-defense.	1
In	1
republican	1
government,	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority	1
necessarily	1
predominates.	1
The	1
remedy	1
for	1
this	1
inconveniency	1
is	1
to	1
divide	1
the	1
legislature	1
into	1
different	1
branches;	1
and	1
to	1
render	1
them,	1
by	1
different	1
modes	1
of	1
election	1
and	1
different	1
principles	1
of	1
action,	1
as	1
little	1
connected	1
with	1
each	1
other	1
as	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
their	1
common	1
functions	1
and	1
their	1
common	1
dependence	1
on	1
the	1
society	1
will	1
admit.	1
It	1
may	1
even	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
dangerous	1
encroachments	1
by	1
still	1
further	1
precautions.	1
As	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority	1
requires	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
thus	1
divided,	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
may	1
require,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
fortified.	1
An	1
absolute	1
negative	1
on	1
the	1
legislature	1
appears,	1
at	1
first	1
view,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
natural	1
defense	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate	1
should	1
be	1
armed.	1
But	1
perhaps	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
neither	1
altogether	1
safe	1
nor	1
alone	1
sufficient.	1
On	1
ordinary	1
occasions	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
exerted	1
with	1
the	1
requisite	1
firmness,	1
and	1
on	1
extraordinary	1
occasions	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
perfidiously	1
abused.	1
May	1
not	1
this	1
defect	1
of	1
an	1
absolute	1
negative	1
be	1
supplied	1
by	1
some	1
qualified	1
connection	1
between	1
this	1
weaker	1
department	1
and	1
the	1
weaker	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
stronger	1
department,	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
latter	1
may	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
constitutional	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
former,	1
without	1
being	1
too	1
much	1
detached	1
from	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
department?	1
If	1
the	1
principles	1
on	1
which	1
these	1
observations	1
are	1
founded	1
be	1
just,	1
as	1
I	1
persuade	1
myself	1
they	1
are,	1
and	1
they	1
be	1
applied	1
as	1
a	1
criterion	1
to	1
the	1
several	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
latter	1
does	1
not	1
perfectly	1
correspond	1
with	1
them,	1
the	1
former	1
are	1
infinitely	1
less	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
such	1
a	1
test.	1
There	1
are,	1
moreover,	1
two	1
considerations	1
particularly	1
applicable	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
system	1
of	1
America,	1
which	1
place	1
that	1
system	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
point	1
of	1
view.	1
First.	1
In	1
a	1
single	1
republic,	1
all	1
the	1
power	1
surrendered	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
government;	1
and	1
the	1
usurpations	1
are	1
guarded	1
against	1
by	1
a	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
into	1
distinct	1
and	1
separate	1
departments.	1
In	1
the	1
compound	1
republic	1
of	1
America,	1
the	1
power	1
surrendered	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
first	1
divided	1
between	1
two	1
distinct	1
governments,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
portion	1
allotted	1
to	1
each	1
subdivided	1
among	1
distinct	1
and	1
separate	1
departments.	1
Hence	1
a	1
double	1
security	1
arises	1
to	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
The	1
different	1
governments	1
will	1
control	1
each	1
other,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
each	1
will	1
be	1
controlled	1
by	1
itself.	1
Second.	1
It	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
in	1
a	1
republic	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
society	1
against	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
its	1
rulers,	1
but	1
to	1
guard	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
against	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
part.	1
Different	1
interests	1
necessarily	1
exist	1
in	1
different	1
classes	1
of	1
citizens.	1
If	1
a	1
majority	1
be	1
united	1
by	1
a	1
common	1
interest,	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
minority	1
will	1
be	1
insecure.	1
There	1
are	1
but	1
two	1
methods	1
of	1
providing	1
against	1
this	1
evil:	1
the	1
one	1
by	1
creating	1
a	1
will	1
in	1
the	1
community	1
independent	1
of	1
the	1
majority	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
itself;	1
the	1
other,	1
by	1
comprehending	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
so	1
many	1
separate	1
descriptions	1
of	1
citizens	1
as	1
will	1
render	1
an	1
unjust	1
combination	1
of	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
very	1
improbable,	1
if	1
not	1
impracticable.	1
The	1
first	1
method	1
prevails	1
in	1
all	1
governments	1
possessing	1
an	1
hereditary	1
or	1
self-appointed	1
authority.	1
This,	1
at	1
best,	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
precarious	1
security;	1
because	1
a	1
power	1
independent	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
espouse	1
the	1
unjust	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
major,	1
as	1
the	1
rightful	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
minor	1
party,	1
and	1
may	1
possibly	1
be	1
turned	1
against	1
both	1
parties.	1
The	1
second	1
method	1
will	1
be	1
exemplified	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
republic	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
Whilst	1
all	1
authority	1
in	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
and	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
society,	1
the	1
society	1
itself	1
will	1
be	1
broken	1
into	1
so	1
many	1
parts,	1
interests,	1
and	1
classes	1
of	1
citizens,	1
that	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
individuals,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
minority,	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
little	1
danger	1
from	1
interested	1
combinations	1
of	1
the	1
majority.	1
In	1
a	1
free	1
government	1
the	1
security	1
for	1
civil	1
rights	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
that	1
for	1
religious	1
rights.	1
It	1
consists	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
case	1
in	1
the	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
interests,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
the	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
sects.	1
The	1
degree	1
of	1
security	1
in	1
both	1
cases	1
will	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
interests	1
and	1
sects;	1
and	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
presumed	1
to	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
country	1
and	1
number	1
of	1
people	1
comprehended	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
government.	1
This	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
must	1
particularly	1
recommend	1
a	1
proper	1
federal	1
system	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
sincere	1
and	1
considerate	1
friends	1
of	1
republican	1
government,	1
since	1
it	1
shows	1
that	1
in	1
exact	1
proportion	1
as	1
the	1
territory	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
may	1
be	1
formed	1
into	1
more	1
circumscribed	1
Confederacies,	1
or	1
States	1
oppressive	1
combinations	1
of	1
a	1
majority	1
will	1
be	1
facilitated:	1
the	1
best	1
security,	1
under	1
the	1
republican	1
forms,	1
for	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
every	1
class	1
of	1
citizens,	1
will	1
be	1
diminished:	1
and	1
consequently	1
the	1
stability	1
and	1
independence	1
of	1
some	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
the	1
only	1
other	1
security,	1
must	1
be	1
proportionately	1
increased.	1
Justice	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
government.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
civil	1
society.	1
It	1
ever	1
has	1
been	1
and	1
ever	1
will	1
be	1
pursued	1
until	1
it	1
be	1
obtained,	1
or	1
until	1
liberty	1
be	1
lost	1
in	1
the	1
pursuit.	1
In	1
a	1
society	1
under	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
stronger	1
faction	1
can	1
readily	1
unite	1
and	1
oppress	1
the	1
weaker,	1
anarchy	1
may	1
as	1
truly	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
reign	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
nature,	1
where	1
the	1
weaker	1
individual	1
is	1
not	1
secured	1
against	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
the	1
stronger;	1
and	1
as,	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
state,	1
even	1
the	1
stronger	1
individuals	1
are	1
prompted,	1
by	1
the	1
uncertainty	1
of	1
their	1
condition,	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
a	1
government	1
which	1
may	1
protect	1
the	1
weak	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
themselves;	1
so,	1
in	1
the	1
former	1
state,	1
will	1
the	1
more	1
powerful	1
factions	1
or	1
parties	1
be	1
gradually	1
induced,	1
by	1
a	1
like	1
motive,	1
to	1
wish	1
for	1
a	1
government	1
which	1
will	1
protect	1
all	1
parties,	1
the	1
weaker	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
more	1
powerful.	1
It	1
can	1
be	1
little	1
doubted	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
Rhode	1
Island	1
was	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
Confederacy	1
and	1
left	1
to	1
itself,	1
the	1
insecurity	1
of	1
rights	1
under	1
the	1
popular	1
form	1
of	1
government	1
within	1
such	1
narrow	1
limits	1
would	1
be	1
displayed	1
by	1
such	1
reiterated	1
oppressions	1
of	1
factious	1
majorities	1
that	1
some	1
power	1
altogether	1
independent	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
called	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
factions	1
whose	1
misrule	1
had	1
proved	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
extended	1
republic	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
great	1
variety	1
of	1
interests,	1
parties,	1
and	1
sects	1
which	1
it	1
embraces,	1
a	1
coalition	1
of	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
society	1
could	1
seldom	1
take	1
place	1
on	1
any	1
other	1
principles	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
justice	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
good;	1
whilst	1
there	1
being	1
thus	1
less	1
danger	1
to	1
a	1
minor	1
from	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
a	1
major	1
party,	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
less	1
pretext,	1
also,	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
the	1
former,	1
by	1
introducing	1
into	1
the	1
government	1
a	1
will	1
not	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
latter,	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
a	1
will	1
independent	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
itself.	1
It	1
is	1
no	1
less	1
certain	1
than	1
it	1
is	1
important,	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
contrary	1
opinions	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
entertained,	1
that	1
the	1
larger	1
the	1
society,	1
provided	1
it	1
lie	1
within	1
a	1
practical	1
sphere,	1
the	1
more	1
duly	1
capable	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
self-government.	1
And	1
happily	1
for	1
the	1
REPUBLICAN	1
CAUSE,	1
the	1
practicable	1
sphere	1
may	1
be	1
carried	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
extent,	1
by	1
a	1
judicious	1
modification	1
and	1

HAMILTON	1
OR	1
MADISON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
FROM	1
the	1
more	1
general	1
inquiries	1
pursued	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
last	1
papers,	1
I	1
pass	1
on	1
to	1
a	1
more	1
particular	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
I	1
shall	1
begin	1
with	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives.	1
The	1
first	1
view	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
of	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
relates	1
to	1
the	1
qualifications	1
of	1
the	1
electors	1
and	1
the	1
elected.	1
Those	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
electors	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
numerous	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures.	1
The	1
definition	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
suffrage	1
is	1
very	1
justly	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
fundamental	1
article	1
of	1
republican	1
government.	1
It	1
was	1
incumbent	1
on	1
the	1
convention,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
define	1
and	1
establish	1
this	1
right	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
To	1
have	1
left	1
it	1
open	1
for	1
the	1
occasional	1
regulation	1
of	1
the	1
Congress,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
improper	1
for	1
the	1
reason	1
just	1
mentioned.	1
To	1
have	1
submitted	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
legislative	1
discretion	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
improper	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
reason;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
additional	1
reason	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
rendered	1
too	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
that	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
people	1
alone.	1
To	1
have	1
reduced	1
the	1
different	1
qualifications	1
in	1
the	1
different	1
States	1
to	1
one	1
uniform	1
rule,	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
dissatisfactory	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
difficult	1
to	1
the	1
convention.	1
The	1
provision	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
appears,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
lay	1
within	1
their	1
option.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
satisfactory	1
to	1
every	1
State,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
conformable	1
to	1
the	1
standard	1
already	1
established,	1
or	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
established,	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
itself.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
safe	1
to	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
because,	1
being	1
fixed	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
alterable	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
and	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
feared	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
will	1
alter	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
constitutions	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
abridge	1
the	1
rights	1
secured	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution.	1
The	1
qualifications	1
of	1
the	1
elected,	1
being	1
less	1
carefully	1
and	1
properly	1
defined	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
and	1
being	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
more	1
susceptible	1
of	1
uniformity,	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
properly	1
considered	1
and	1
regulated	1
by	1
the	1
convention.	1
A	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
must	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
twenty-five	1
years;	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
seven	1
years	1
a	1
citizen	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States;	1
must,	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
election,	1
be	1
an	1
inhabitant	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
represent;	1
and,	1
during	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
service,	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
no	1
office	1
under	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
Under	1
these	1
reasonable	1
limitations,	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
is	1
open	1
to	1
merit	1
of	1
every	1
description,	1
whether	1
native	1
or	1
adoptive,	1
whether	1
young	1
or	1
old,	1
and	1
without	1
regard	1
to	1
poverty	1
or	1
wealth,	1
or	1
to	1
any	1
particular	1
profession	1
of	1
religious	1
faith.	1
The	1
term	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
representatives	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
elected	1
falls	1
under	1
a	1
second	1
view	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
taken	1
of	1
this	1
branch.	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
decide	1
on	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
this	1
article,	1
two	1
questions	1
must	1
be	1
considered:	1
first,	1
whether	1
biennial	1
elections	1
will,	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
be	1
safe;	1
secondly,	1
whether	1
they	1
be	1
necessary	1
or	1
useful.	1
First.	1
As	1
it	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
liberty	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
in	1
general	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
common	1
interest	1
with	1
the	1
people,	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
particularly	1
essential	1
that	1
the	1
branch	1
of	1
it	1
under	1
consideration	1
should	1
have	1
an	1
immediate	1
dependence	1
on,	1
and	1
an	1
intimate	1
sympathy	1
with,	1
the	1
people.	1
Frequent	1
elections	1
are	1
unquestionably	1
the	1
only	1
policy	1
by	1
which	1
this	1
dependence	1
and	1
sympathy	1
can	1
be	1
effectually	1
secured.	1
But	1
what	1
particular	1
degree	1
of	1
frequency	1
may	1
be	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
purpose,	1
does	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
susceptible	1
of	1
any	1
precise	1
calculation,	1
and	1
must	1
depend	1
on	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
circumstances	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
connected.	1
Let	1
us	1
consult	1
experience,	1
the	1
guide	1
that	1
ought	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
followed	1
whenever	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
found.	1
The	1
scheme	1
of	1
representation,	1
as	1
a	1
substitute	1
for	1
a	1
meeting	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
in	1
person,	1
being	1
at	1
most	1
but	1
very	1
imperfectly	1
known	1
to	1
ancient	1
polity,	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
more	1
modern	1
times	1
only	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
expect	1
instructive	1
examples.	1
And	1
even	1
here,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
research	1
too	1
vague	1
and	1
diffusive,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
proper	1
to	1
confine	1
ourselves	1
to	1
the	1
few	1
examples	1
which	1
are	1
best	1
known,	1
and	1
which	1
bear	1
the	1
greatest	1
analogy	1
to	1
our	1
particular	1
case.	1
The	1
first	1
to	1
which	1
this	1
character	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
applied,	1
is	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Commons	1
in	1
Great	1
Britain.	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
this	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
English	1
Constitution,	1
anterior	1
to	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
Magna	1
Charta,	1
is	1
too	1
obscure	1
to	1
yield	1
instruction.	1
The	1
very	1
existence	1
of	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
a	1
question	1
among	1
political	1
antiquaries.	1
The	1
earliest	1
records	1
of	1
subsequent	1
date	1
prove	1
that	1
parliaments	1
were	1
to	1
SIT	1
only	1
every	1
year;	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
ELECTED	1
every	1
year.	1
And	1
even	1
these	1
annual	1
sessions	1
were	1
left	1
so	1
much	1
at	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
the	1
monarch,	1
that,	1
under	1
various	1
pretexts,	1
very	1
long	1
and	1
dangerous	1
intermissions	1
were	1
often	1
contrived	1
by	1
royal	1
ambition.	1
To	1
remedy	1
this	1
grievance,	1
it	1
was	1
provided	1
by	1
a	1
statute	1
in	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Charles	1
II.	1
,	1
that	1
the	1
intermissions	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
protracted	1
beyond	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
three	1
years.	1
On	1
the	1
accession	1
of	1
William	1
III.,	1
when	1
a	1
revolution	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
government,	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
seriously	1
resumed,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
among	1
the	1
fundamental	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
that	1
parliaments	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
held	1
FREQUENTLY.	1
By	1
another	1
statute,	1
which	1
passed	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
later	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
reign,	1
the	1
term	1
"frequently,"	1
which	1
had	1
alluded	1
to	1
the	1
triennial	1
period	1
settled	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Charles	1
II.,	1
is	1
reduced	1
to	1
a	1
precise	1
meaning,	1
it	1
being	1
expressly	1
enacted	1
that	1
a	1
new	1
parliament	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
within	1
three	1
years	1
after	1
the	1
termination	1
of	1
the	1
former.	1
The	1
last	1
change,	1
from	1
three	1
to	1
seven	1
years,	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
introduced	1
pretty	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
century,	1
under	1
on	1
alarm	1
for	1
the	1
Hanoverian	1
succession.	1
From	1
these	1
facts	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
the	1
greatest	1
frequency	1
of	1
elections	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
deemed	1
necessary	1
in	1
that	1
kingdom,	1
for	1
binding	1
the	1
representatives	1
to	1
their	1
constituents,	1
does	1
not	1
exceed	1
a	1
triennial	1
return	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
if	1
we	1
may	1
argue	1
from	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
liberty	1
retained	1
even	1
under	1
septennial	1
elections,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
vicious	1
ingredients	1
in	1
the	1
parliamentary	1
constitution,	1
we	1
cannot	1
doubt	1
that	1
a	1
reduction	1
of	1
the	1
period	1
from	1
seven	1
to	1
three	1
years,	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
necessary	1
reforms,	1
would	1
so	1
far	1
extend	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
over	1
their	1
representatives	1
as	1
to	1
satisfy	1
us	1
that	1
biennial	1
elections,	1
under	1
the	1
federal	1
system,	1
cannot	1
possibly	1
be	1
dangerous	1
to	1
the	1
requisite	1
dependence	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
on	1
their	1
constituents.	1
Elections	1
in	1
Ireland,	1
till	1
of	1
late,	1
were	1
regulated	1
entirely	1
by	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
the	1
crown,	1
and	1
were	1
seldom	1
repeated,	1
except	1
on	1
the	1
accession	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
prince,	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
contingent	1
event.	1
The	1
parliament	1
which	1
commenced	1
with	1
George	1
II.	1
was	1
continued	1
throughout	1
his	1
whole	1
reign,	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
about	1
thirty-five	1
years.	1
The	1
only	1
dependence	1
of	1
the	1
representatives	1
on	1
the	1
people	1
consisted	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
to	1
supply	1
occasional	1
vacancies	1
by	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
new	1
members,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
some	1
event	1
which	1
might	1
produce	1
a	1
general	1
new	1
election.	1
The	1
ability	1
also	1
of	1
the	1
Irish	1
parliament	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
their	1
constituents,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
disposition	1
might	1
exist,	1
was	1
extremely	1
shackled	1
by	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
the	1
crown	1
over	1
the	1
subjects	1
of	1
their	1
deliberation.	1
Of	1
late	1
these	1
shackles,	1
if	1
I	1
mistake	1
not,	1
have	1
been	1
broken;	1
and	1
octennial	1
parliaments	1
have	1
besides	1
been	1
established.	1
What	1
effect	1
may	1
be	1
produced	1
by	1
this	1
partial	1
reform,	1
must	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
further	1
experience.	1
The	1
example	1
of	1
Ireland,	1
from	1
this	1
view	1
of	1
it,	1
can	1
throw	1
but	1
little	1
light	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
can	1
draw	1
any	1
conclusion	1
from	1
it,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
that	1
country	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
under	1
all	1
these	1
disadvantages	1
to	1
retain	1
any	1
liberty	1
whatever,	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
biennial	1
elections	1
would	1
secure	1
to	1
them	1
every	1
degree	1
of	1
liberty,	1
which	1
might	1
depend	1
on	1
a	1
due	1
connection	1
between	1
their	1
representatives	1
and	1
themselves.	1
Let	1
us	1
bring	1
our	1
inquiries	1
nearer	1
home.	1
The	1
example	1
of	1
these	1
States,	1
when	1
British	1
colonies,	1
claims	1
particular	1
attention,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
as	1
to	1
require	1
little	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
on	1
it.	1
The	1
principle	1
of	1
representation,	1
in	1
one	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
at	1
least,	1
was	1
established	1
in	1
all	1
of	1
them.	1
But	1
the	1
periods	1
of	1
election	1
were	1
different.	1
They	1
varied	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
seven	1
years.	1
Have	1
we	1
any	1
reason	1
to	1
infer,	1
from	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
prior	1
to	1
the	1
Revolution,	1
that	1
biennial	1
elections	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
dangerous	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
liberties?	1
The	1
spirit	1
which	1
everywhere	1
displayed	1
itself	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
struggle,	1
and	1
which	1
vanquished	1
the	1
obstacles	1
to	1
independence,	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
proofs	1
that	1
a	1
sufficient	1
portion	1
of	1
liberty	1
had	1
been	1
everywhere	1
enjoyed	1
to	1
inspire	1
both	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
its	1
worth	1
and	1
a	1
zeal	1
for	1
its	1
proper	1
enlargement	1
This	1
remark	1
holds	1
good,	1
as	1
well	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
then	1
colonies	1
whose	1
elections	1
were	1
least	1
frequent,	1
as	1
to	1
those	1
whose	1
elections	1
were	1
most	1
frequent	1
Virginia	1
was	1
the	1
colony	1
which	1
stood	1
first	1
in	1
resisting	1
the	1
parliamentary	1
usurpations	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
also	1
in	1
espousing,	1
by	1
public	1
act,	1
the	1
resolution	1
of	1
independence.	1
In	1
Virginia,	1
nevertheless,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
misinformed,	1
elections	1
under	1
the	1
former	1
government	1
were	1
septennial.	1
This	1
particular	1
example	1
is	1
brought	1
into	1
view,	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
any	1
peculiar	1
merit,	1
for	1
the	1
priority	1
in	1
those	1
instances	1
was	1
probably	1
accidental;	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
of	1
any	1
advantage	1
in	1
SEPTENNIAL	1
elections,	1
for	1
when	1
compared	1
with	1
a	1
greater	1
frequency	1
they	1
are	1
inadmissible;	1
but	1
merely	1
as	1
a	1
proof,	1
and	1
I	1
conceive	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
substantial	1
proof,	1
that	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
can	1
be	1
in	1
no	1
danger	1
from	1
BIENNIAL	1
elections.	1
The	1
conclusion	1
resulting	1
from	1
these	1
examples	1
will	1
be	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
strengthened	1
by	1
recollecting	1
three	1
circumstances.	1
The	1
first	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
federal	1
legislature	1
will	1
possess	1
a	1
part	1
only	1
of	1
that	1
supreme	1
legislative	1
authority	1
which	1
is	1
vested	1
completely	1
in	1
the	1
British	1
Parliament;	1
and	1
which,	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
exceptions,	1
was	1
exercised	1
by	1
the	1
colonial	1
assemblies	1
and	1
the	1
Irish	1
legislature.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
received	1
and	1
well-founded	1
maxim,	1
that	1
where	1
no	1
other	1
circumstances	1
affect	1
the	1
case,	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
power	1
is,	1
the	1
shorter	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
its	1
duration;	1
and,	1
conversely,	1
the	1
smaller	1
the	1
power,	1
the	1
more	1
safely	1
may	1
its	1
duration	1
be	1
protracted.	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
place,	1
it	1
has,	1
on	1
another	1
occasion,	1
been	1
shown	1
that	1
the	1
federal	1
legislature	1
will	1
not	1
only	1
be	1
restrained	1
by	1
its	1
dependence	1
on	1
its	1
people,	1
as	1
other	1
legislative	1
bodies	1
are,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be,	1
moreover,	1
watched	1
and	1
controlled	1
by	1
the	1
several	1
collateral	1
legislatures,	1
which	1
other	1
legislative	1
bodies	1
are	1
not.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
place,	1
no	1
comparison	1
can	1
be	1
made	1
between	1
the	1
means	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
more	1
permanent	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
for	1
seducing,	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
seduce,	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
from	1
their	1
duty	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
influence	1
over	1
the	1
popular	1
branch	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
above	1
cited.	1
With	1
less	1
power,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
abuse,	1
the	1
federal	1
representatives	1
can	1
be	1
less	1
tempted	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
doubly	1
watched	1
on	1
the	1
other.	1

HAMILTON	1
OR	1
MADISON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
I	1
SHALL	1
here,	1
perhaps,	1
be	1
reminded	1
of	1
a	1
current	1
observation,	1
"that	1
where	1
annual	1
elections	1
end,	1
tyranny	1
begins.	1
"	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
true,	1
as	1
has	1
often	1
been	1
remarked,	1
that	1
sayings	1
which	1
become	1
proverbial	1
are	1
generally	1
founded	1
in	1
reason,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
less	1
true,	1
that	1
when	1
once	1
established,	1
they	1
are	1
often	1
applied	1
to	1
cases	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
them	1
does	1
not	1
extend.	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
look	1
for	1
a	1
proof	1
beyond	1
the	1
case	1
before	1
us.	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
reason	1
on	1
which	1
this	1
proverbial	1
observation	1
is	1
founded?	1
No	1
man	1
will	1
subject	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
ridicule	1
of	1
pretending	1
that	1
any	1
natural	1
connection	1
subsists	1
between	1
the	1
sun	1
or	1
the	1
seasons,	1
and	1
the	1
period	1
within	1
which	1
human	1
virtue	1
can	1
bear	1
the	1
temptations	1
of	1
power.	1
Happily	1
for	1
mankind,	1
liberty	1
is	1
not,	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
confined	1
to	1
any	1
single	1
point	1
of	1
time;	1
but	1
lies	1
within	1
extremes,	1
which	1
afford	1
sufficient	1
latitude	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
variations	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
required	1
by	1
the	1
various	1
situations	1
and	1
circumstances	1
of	1
civil	1
society.	1
The	1
election	1
of	1
magistrates	1
might	1
be,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
found	1
expedient,	1
as	1
in	1
some	1
instances	1
it	1
actually	1
has	1
been,	1
daily,	1
weekly,	1
or	1
monthly,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
annual;	1
and	1
if	1
circumstances	1
may	1
require	1
a	1
deviation	1
from	1
the	1
rule	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
why	1
not	1
also	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side?	1
Turning	1
our	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
periods	1
established	1
among	1
ourselves,	1
for	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
numerous	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
we	1
find	1
them	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
coinciding	1
any	1
more	1
in	1
this	1
instance,	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
elections	1
of	1
other	1
civil	1
magistrates.	1
In	1
Connecticut	1
and	1
Rhode	1
Island,	1
the	1
periods	1
are	1
half-yearly.	1
In	1
the	1
other	1
States,	1
South	1
Carolina	1
excepted,	1
they	1
are	1
annual.	1
In	1
South	1
Carolina	1
they	1
are	1
biennial	1
as	1
is	1
proposed	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
government.	1
Here	1
is	1
a	1
difference,	1
as	1
four	1
to	1
one,	1
between	1
the	1
longest	1
and	1
shortest	1
periods;	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
show,	1
that	1
Connecticut	1
or	1
Rhode	1
Island	1
is	1
better	1
governed,	1
or	1
enjoys	1
a	1
greater	1
share	1
of	1
rational	1
liberty,	1
than	1
South	1
Carolina;	1
or	1
that	1
either	1
the	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
these	1
States	1
is	1
distinguished	1
in	1
these	1
respects,	1
and	1
by	1
these	1
causes,	1
from	1
the	1
States	1
whose	1
elections	1
are	1
different	1
from	1
both.	1
In	1
searching	1
for	1
the	1
grounds	1
of	1
this	1
doctrine,	1
I	1
can	1
discover	1
but	1
one,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
wholly	1
inapplicable	1
to	1
our	1
case.	1
The	1
important	1
distinction	1
so	1
well	1
understood	1
in	1
America,	1
between	1
a	1
Constitution	1
established	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
unalterable	1
by	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
a	1
law	1
established	1
by	1
the	1
government	1
and	1
alterable	1
by	1
the	1
government,	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
little	1
understood	1
and	1
less	1
observed	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
country.	1
Wherever	1
the	1
supreme	1
power	1
of	1
legislation	1
has	1
resided,	1
has	1
been	1
supposed	1
to	1
reside	1
also	1
a	1
full	1
power	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
Even	1
in	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
where	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
political	1
and	1
civil	1
liberty	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
discussed,	1
and	1
where	1
we	1
hear	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
it	1
is	1
maintained	1
that	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Parliament	1
is	1
transcendent	1
and	1
uncontrollable,	1
as	1
well	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
as	1
the	1
ordinary	1
objects	1
of	1
legislative	1
provision.	1
They	1
have	1
accordingly,	1
in	1
several	1
instances,	1
actually	1
changed,	1
by	1
legislative	1
acts,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
fundamental	1
articles	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
They	1
have	1
in	1
particular,	1
on	1
several	1
occasions,	1
changed	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
election;	1
and,	1
on	1
the	1
last	1
occasion,	1
not	1
only	1
introduced	1
septennial	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
triennial	1
elections,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
act,	1
continued	1
themselves	1
in	1
place	1
four	1
years	1
beyond	1
the	1
term	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
elected	1
by	1
the	1
people.	1
An	1
attention	1
to	1
these	1
dangerous	1
practices	1
has	1
produced	1
a	1
very	1
natural	1
alarm	1
in	1
the	1
votaries	1
of	1
free	1
government,	1
of	1
which	1
frequency	1
of	1
elections	1
is	1
the	1
corner-stone;	1
and	1
has	1
led	1
them	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
some	1
security	1
to	1
liberty,	1
against	1
the	1
danger	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
exposed.	1
Where	1
no	1
Constitution,	1
paramount	1
to	1
the	1
government,	1
either	1
existed	1
or	1
could	1
be	1
obtained,	1
no	1
constitutional	1
security,	1
similar	1
to	1
that	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
attempted.	1
Some	1
other	1
security,	1
therefore,	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
sought	1
for;	1
and	1
what	1
better	1
security	1
would	1
the	1
case	1
admit,	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
selecting	1
and	1
appealing	1
to	1
some	1
simple	1
and	1
familiar	1
portion	1
of	1
time,	1
as	1
a	1
standard	1
for	1
measuring	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
innovations,	1
for	1
fixing	1
the	1
national	1
sentiment,	1
and	1
for	1
uniting	1
the	1
patriotic	1
exertions?	1
The	1
most	1
simple	1
and	1
familiar	1
portion	1
of	1
time,	1
applicable	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
year;	1
and	1
hence	1
the	1
doctrine	1
has	1
been	1
inculcated	1
by	1
a	1
laudable	1
zeal,	1
to	1
erect	1
some	1
barrier	1
against	1
the	1
gradual	1
innovations	1
of	1
an	1
unlimited	1
government,	1
that	1
the	1
advance	1
towards	1
tyranny	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
calculated	1
by	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
departure	1
from	1
the	1
fixed	1
point	1
of	1
annual	1
elections.	1
But	1
what	1
necessity	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
of	1
applying	1
this	1
expedient	1
to	1
a	1
government	1
limited,	1
as	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
will	1
be,	1
by	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
a	1
paramount	1
Constitution?	1
Or	1
who	1
will	1
pretend	1
that	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
more	1
secure	1
under	1
biennial	1
elections,	1
unalterably	1
fixed	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
Constitution,	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
nation	1
would	1
be,	1
where	1
elections	1
were	1
annual,	1
or	1
even	1
more	1
frequent,	1
but	1
subject	1
to	1
alterations	1
by	1
the	1
ordinary	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
government?	1
The	1
second	1
question	1
stated	1
is,	1
whether	1
biennial	1
elections	1
be	1
necessary	1
or	1
useful.	1
The	1
propriety	1
of	1
answering	1
this	1
question	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative	1
will	1
appear	1
from	1
several	1
very	1
obvious	1
considerations.	1
No	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
a	1
competent	1
legislator	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
add	1
to	1
an	1
upright	1
intention	1
and	1
a	1
sound	1
judgment	1
a	1
certain	1
degree	1
of	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
subjects	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
legislate.	1
A	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
knowledge	1
may	1
be	1
acquired	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
information	1
which	1
lie	1
within	1
the	1
compass	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
private	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
public	1
stations.	1
Another	1
part	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
attained,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
thoroughly	1
attained,	1
by	1
actual	1
experience	1
in	1
the	1
station	1
which	1
requires	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
period	1
of	1
service,	1
ought,	1
therefore,	1
in	1
all	1
such	1
cases,	1
to	1
bear	1
some	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
practical	1
knowledge	1
requisite	1
to	1
the	1
due	1
performance	1
of	1
the	1
service.	1
The	1
period	1
of	1
legislative	1
service	1
established	1
in	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
for	1
the	1
more	1
numerous	1
branch	1
is,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
one	1
year.	1
The	1
question	1
then	1
may	1
be	1
put	1
into	1
this	1
simple	1
form:	1
does	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
two	1
years	1
bear	1
no	1
greater	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
requisite	1
for	1
federal	1
legislation	1
than	1
one	1
year	1
does	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
requisite	1
for	1
State	1
legislation?	1
The	1
very	1
statement	1
of	1
the	1
question,	1
in	1
this	1
form,	1
suggests	1
the	1
answer	1
that	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
it.	1
In	1
a	1
single	1
State,	1
the	1
requisite	1
knowledge	1
relates	1
to	1
the	1
existing	1
laws	1
which	1
are	1
uniform	1
throughout	1
the	1
State,	1
and	1
with	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
citizens	1
are	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
conversant;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
State,	1
which	1
lie	1
within	1
a	1
small	1
compass,	1
are	1
not	1
very	1
diversified,	1
and	1
occupy	1
much	1
of	1
the	1
attention	1
and	1
conversation	1
of	1
every	1
class	1
of	1
people.	1
The	1
great	1
theatre	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
presents	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
scene.	1
The	1
laws	1
are	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
uniform,	1
that	1
they	1
vary	1
in	1
every	1
State;	1
whilst	1
the	1
public	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
are	1
spread	1
throughout	1
a	1
very	1
extensive	1
region,	1
and	1
are	1
extremely	1
diversified	1
by	1
t	1
e	1
local	1
affairs	1
connected	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
can	1
with	1
difficulty	1
be	1
correctly	1
learnt	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
place	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
central	1
councils	1
to	1
which	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
be	1
brought	1
by	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
empire.	1
Yet	1
some	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
affairs,	1
and	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
laws,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
States,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
possessed	1
by	1
the	1
members	1
from	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
How	1
can	1
foreign	1
trade	1
be	1
properly	1
regulated	1
by	1
uniform	1
laws,	1
without	1
some	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
the	1
commerce,	1
the	1
ports,	1
the	1
usages,	1
and	1
the	1
regulatious	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
States?	1
How	1
can	1
the	1
trade	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
States	1
be	1
duly	1
regulated,	1
without	1
some	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
relative	1
situations	1
in	1
these	1
and	1
other	1
respects?	1
How	1
can	1
taxes	1
be	1
judiciously	1
imposed	1
and	1
effectually	1
collected,	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
accommodated	1
to	1
the	1
different	1
laws	1
and	1
local	1
circumstances	1
relating	1
to	1
these	1
objects	1
in	1
the	1
different	1
States?	1
How	1
can	1
uniform	1
regulations	1
for	1
the	1
militia	1
be	1
duly	1
provided,	1
without	1
a	1
similar	1
knowledge	1
of	1
many	1
internal	1
circumstances	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
States	1
are	1
distinguished	1
from	1
each	1
other?	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
principal	1
objects	1
of	1
federal	1
legislation,	1
and	1
suggest	1
most	1
forcibly	1
the	1
extensive	1
information	1
which	1
the	1
representatives	1
ought	1
to	1
acquire.	1
The	1
other	1
interior	1
objects	1
will	1
require	1
a	1
proportional	1
degree	1
of	1
information	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
them.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
difficulties	1
will,	1
by	1
degrees,	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
diminished.	1
The	1
most	1
laborious	1
task	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
proper	1
inauguration	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
and	1
the	1
primeval	1
formation	1
of	1
a	1
federal	1
code.	1
Improvements	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
draughts	1
will	1
every	1
year	1
become	1
both	1
easier	1
and	1
fewer.	1
Past	1
transactions	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
ready	1
and	1
accurate	1
source	1
of	1
information	1
to	1
new	1
members.	1
The	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
will	1
become	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
objects	1
of	1
curiosity	1
and	1
conversation	1
among	1
the	1
citizens	1
at	1
large.	1
And	1
the	1
increased	1
intercourse	1
among	1
those	1
of	1
different	1
States	1
will	1
contribute	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
diffuse	1
a	1
mutual	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
affairs,	1
as	1
this	1
again	1
will	1
contribute	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
assimilation	1
of	1
their	1
manners	1
and	1
laws.	1
But	1
with	1
all	1
these	1
abatements,	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
federal	1
legislation	1
must	1
continue	1
so	1
far	1
to	1
exceed,	1
both	1
in	1
novelty	1
and	1
difficulty,	1
the	1
legislative	1
business	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
State,	1
as	1
to	1
justify	1
the	1
longer	1
period	1
of	1
service	1
assigned	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
transact	1
it.	1
A	1
branch	1
of	1
knowledge	1
which	1
belongs	1
to	1
the	1
acquirements	1
of	1
a	1
federal	1
representative,	1
and	1
which	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
mentioned	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
foreign	1
affairs.	1
In	1
regulating	1
our	1
own	1
commerce	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
not	1
only	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
treaties	1
between	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
and	1
other	1
nations,	1
but	1
also	1
with	1
the	1
commercial	1
policy	1
and	1
laws	1
of	1
other	1
nations.	1
He	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
altogether	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
nations;	1
for	1
that,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
proper	1
object	1
of	1
municipal	1
legislation,	1
is	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
government.	1
And	1
although	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
is	1
not	1
immediately	1
to	1
participate	1
in	1
foreign	1
negotiations	1
and	1
arrangements,	1
yet	1
from	1
the	1
necessary	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
several	1
branches	1
of	1
public	1
affairs,	1
those	1
particular	1
branches	1
will	1
frequently	1
deserve	1
attention	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
course	1
of	1
legislation,	1
and	1
will	1
sometimes	1
demand	1
particular	1
legislative	1
sanction	1
and	1
co-operation.	1
Some	1
portion	1
of	1
this	1
knowledge	1
may,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
be	1
acquired	1
in	1
a	1
man's	1
closet;	1
but	1
some	1
of	1
it	1
also	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
public	1
sources	1
of	1
information;	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
acquired	1
to	1
best	1
effect	1
by	1
a	1
practical	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
during	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
actual	1
service	1
in	1
the	1
legislature.	1
There	1
are	1
other	1
considerations,	1
of	1
less	1
importance,	1
perhaps,	1
but	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
unworthy	1
of	1
notice.	1
The	1
distance	1
which	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
representatives	1
will	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
travel,	1
and	1
the	1
arrangements	1
rendered	1
necessary	1
by	1
that	1
circumstance,	1
might	1
be	1
much	1
more	1
serious	1
objections	1
with	1
fit	1
men	1
to	1
this	1
service,	1
if	1
limited	1
to	1
a	1
single	1
year,	1
than	1
if	1
extended	1
to	1
two	1
years.	1
No	1
argument	1
can	1
be	1
drawn	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
from	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
delegates	1
to	1
the	1
existing	1
Congress.	1
They	1
are	1
elected	1
annually,	1
it	1
is	1
true;	1
but	1
their	1
re-election	1
is	1
considered	1
by	1
the	1
legislative	1
assemblies	1
almost	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
course.	1
The	1
election	1
of	1
the	1
representatives	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
principle.	1
A	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
members,	1
as	1
happens	1
in	1
all	1
such	1
assemblies,	1
will	1
possess	1
superior	1
talents;	1
will,	1
by	1
frequent	1
reelections,	1
become	1
members	1
of	1
long	1
standing;	1
will	1
be	1
thoroughly	1
masters	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
business,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
not	1
unwilling	1
to	1
avail	1
themselves	1
of	1
those	1
advantages.	1
The	1
greater	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
new	1
members,	1
and	1
the	1
less	1
the	1
information	1
of	1
the	1
bulk	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
the	1
more	1
apt	1
will	1
they	1
be	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
snares	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
laid	1
for	1
them.	1
This	1
remark	1
is	1
no	1
less	1
applicable	1
to	1
the	1
relation	1
which	1
will	1
subsist	1
between	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
and	1
the	1
Senate.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
inconvenience	1
mingled	1
with	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
our	1
frequent	1
elections	1
even	1
in	1
single	1
States,	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
large,	1
and	1
hold	1
but	1
one	1
legislative	1
session	1
in	1
a	1
year,	1
that	1
spurious	1
elections	1
cannot	1
be	1
investigated	1
and	1
annulled	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
decision	1
to	1
have	1
its	1
due	1
effect.	1
If	1
a	1
return	1
can	1
be	1
obtained,	1
no	1
matter	1
by	1
what	1
unlawful	1
means,	1
the	1
irregular	1
member,	1
who	1
takes	1
his	1
seat	1
of	1
course,	1
is	1
sure	1
of	1
holding	1
it	1
a	1
sufficient	1
time	1
to	1
answer	1
his	1
purposes.	1
Hence,	1
a	1
very	1
pernicious	1
encouragement	1
is	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
unlawful	1
means,	1
for	1
obtaining	1
irregular	1
returns.	1
Were	1
elections	1
for	1
the	1
federal	1
legislature	1
to	1
be	1
annual,	1
this	1
practice	1
might	1
become	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
abuse,	1
particularly	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
distant	1
States.	1
Each	1
house	1
is,	1
as	1
it	1
necessarily	1
must	1
be,	1
the	1
judge	1
of	1
the	1
elections,	1
qualifications,	1
and	1
returns	1
of	1
its	1
members;	1
and	1
whatever	1
improvements	1
may	1
be	1
suggested	1
by	1
experience,	1
for	1
simplifying	1
and	1
accelerating	1
the	1
process	1
in	1
disputed	1
cases,	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
a	1
year	1
would	1
unavoidably	1
elapse,	1
before	1
an	1
illegitimate	1
member	1
could	1
be	1
dispossessed	1
of	1
his	1
seat,	1
that	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
event	1
would	1
be	1
little	1
check	1
to	1
unfair	1
and	1
illicit	1
means	1
of	1
obtaining	1
a	1
seat.	1
All	1
these	1
considerations	1
taken	1
together	1
warrant	1
us	1
in	1
affirming,	1
that	1
biennial	1
elections	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
useful	1
to	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
safe	1
to	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1

THE	1
next	1
view	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
relates	1
to	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
its	1
members	1
to	1
the	1
several	1
States	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
determined	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
rule	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
direct	1
taxes.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
contended	1
that	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
people	1
in	1
each	1
State	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
standard	1
for	1
regulating	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
represent	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
each	1
State.	1
The	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
rule	1
for	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
taxes,	1
will	1
probably	1
be	1
as	1
little	1
contested;	1
though	1
the	1
rule	1
itself	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
founded	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
principle.	1
In	1
the	1
former	1
case,	1
the	1
rule	1
is	1
understood	1
to	1
refer	1
to	1
the	1
personal	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
a	1
natural	1
and	1
universal	1
connection.	1
In	1
the	1
latter,	1
it	1
has	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
wealth,	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
no	1
case	1
a	1
precise	1
measure,	1
and	1
in	1
ordinary	1
cases	1
a	1
very	1
unfit	1
one.	1
But	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
imperfection	1
of	1
the	1
rule	1
as	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
relative	1
wealth	1
and	1
contributions	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
it	1
is	1
evidently	1
the	1
least	1
objectionable	1
among	1
the	1
practicable	1
rules,	1
and	1
had	1
too	1
recently	1
obtained	1
the	1
general	1
sanction	1
of	1
America,	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
ready	1
preference	1
with	1
the	1
convention.	1
All	1
this	1
is	1
admitted,	1
it	1
will	1
perhaps	1
be	1
said;	1
but	1
does	1
it	1
follow,	1
from	1
an	1
admission	1
of	1
numbers	1
for	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
representation,	1
or	1
of	1
slaves	1
combined	1
with	1
free	1
citizens	1
as	1
a	1
ratio	1
of	1
taxation,	1
that	1
slaves	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
included	1
in	1
the	1
numerical	1
rule	1
of	1
representation?	1
Slaves	1
are	1
considered	1
as	1
property,	1
not	1
as	1
persons.	1
They	1
ought	1
therefore	1
to	1
be	1
comprehended	1
in	1
estimates	1
of	1
taxation	1
which	1
are	1
founded	1
on	1
property,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
excluded	1
from	1
representation	1
which	1
is	1
regulated	1
by	1
a	1
census	1
of	1
persons.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
objection,	1
as	1
I	1
understand	1
it,	1
stated	1
in	1
its	1
full	1
force.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
equally	1
candid	1
in	1
stating	1
the	1
reasoning	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
offered	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side.	1
"We	1
subscribe	1
to	1
the	1
doctrine,"	1
might	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
Southern	1
brethren	1
observe,	1
"that	1
representation	1
relates	1
more	1
immediately	1
to	1
persons,	1
and	1
taxation	1
more	1
immediately	1
to	1
property,	1
and	1
we	1
join	1
in	1
the	1
application	1
of	1
this	1
distinction	1
to	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
our	1
slaves.	1
But	1
we	1
must	1
deny	1
the	1
fact,	1
that	1
slaves	1
are	1
considered	1
merely	1
as	1
property,	1
and	1
in	1
no	1
respect	1
whatever	1
as	1
persons.	1
The	1
true	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
is,	1
that	1
they	1
partake	1
of	1
both	1
these	1
qualities:	1
being	1
considered	1
by	1
our	1
laws,	1
in	1
some	1
respects,	1
as	1
persons,	1
and	1
in	1
other	1
respects	1
as	1
property.	1
In	1
being	1
compelled	1
to	1
labor,	1
not	1
for	1
himself,	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
master;	1
in	1
being	1
vendible	1
by	1
one	1
master	1
to	1
another	1
master;	1
and	1
in	1
being	1
subject	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
to	1
be	1
restrained	1
in	1
his	1
liberty	1
and	1
chastised	1
in	1
his	1
body,	1
by	1
the	1
capricious	1
will	1
of	1
another,	1
the	1
slave	1
may	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
degraded	1
from	1
the	1
human	1
rank,	1
and	1
classed	1
with	1
those	1
irrational	1
animals	1
which	1
fall	1
under	1
the	1
legal	1
denomination	1
of	1
property.	1
In	1
being	1
protected,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
limbs,	1
against	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
all	1
others,	1
even	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
labor	1
and	1
his	1
liberty;	1
and	1
in	1
being	1
punishable	1
himself	1
for	1
all	1
violence	1
committed	1
against	1
others,	1
the	1
slave	1
is	1
no	1
less	1
evidently	1
regarded	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
as	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
society,	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
irrational	1
creation;	1
as	1
a	1
moral	1
person,	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
mere	1
article	1
of	1
property.	1
The	1
federal	1
Constitution,	1
therefore,	1
decides	1
with	1
great	1
propriety	1
on	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
our	1
slaves,	1
when	1
it	1
views	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
mixed	1
character	1
of	1
persons	1
and	1
of	1
property.	1
This	1
is	1
in	1
fact	1
their	1
true	1
character.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
character	1
bestowed	1
on	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
laws	1
under	1
which	1
they	1
live;	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
denied,	1
that	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
proper	1
criterion;	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
under	1
the	1
pretext	1
that	1
the	1
laws	1
have	1
transformed	1
the	1
negroes	1
into	1
subjects	1
of	1
property,	1
that	1
a	1
place	1
is	1
disputed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
computation	1
of	1
numbers;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
admitted,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
laws	1
were	1
to	1
restore	1
the	1
rights	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
away,	1
the	1
negroes	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
refused	1
an	1
equal	1
share	1
of	1
representation	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
inhabitants.	1
"This	1
question	1
may	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
another	1
light.	1
It	1
is	1
agreed	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
that	1
numbers	1
are	1
the	1
best	1
scale	1
of	1
wealth	1
and	1
taxation,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
proper	1
scale	1
of	1
representation.	1
Would	1
the	1
convention	1
have	1
been	1
impartial	1
or	1
consistent,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
rejected	1
the	1
slaves	1
from	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
inhabitants,	1
when	1
the	1
shares	1
of	1
representation	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
calculated,	1
and	1
inserted	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
lists	1
when	1
the	1
tariff	1
of	1
contributions	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
adjusted?	1
Could	1
it	1
be	1
reasonably	1
expected,	1
that	1
the	1
Southern	1
States	1
would	1
concur	1
in	1
a	1
system,	1
which	1
considered	1
their	1
slaves	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
as	1
men,	1
when	1
burdens	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
imposed,	1
but	1
refused	1
to	1
consider	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
light,	1
when	1
advantages	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
conferred?	1
Might	1
not	1
some	1
surprise	1
also	1
be	1
expressed,	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
reproach	1
the	1
Southern	1
States	1
with	1
the	1
barbarous	1
policy	1
of	1
considering	1
as	1
property	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
human	1
brethren,	1
should	1
themselves	1
contend,	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
States	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
parties,	1
ought	1
to	1
consider	1
this	1
unfortunate	1
race	1
more	1
completely	1
in	1
the	1
unnatural	1
light	1
of	1
property,	1
than	1
the	1
very	1
laws	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
complain?	1
"It	1
may	1
be	1
replied,	1
perhaps,	1
that	1
slaves	1
are	1
not	1
included	1
in	1
the	1
estimate	1
of	1
representatives	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
possessing	1
them.	1
They	1
neither	1
vote	1
themselves	1
nor	1
increase	1
the	1
votes	1
of	1
their	1
masters.	1
Upon	1
what	1
principle,	1
then,	1
ought	1
they	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
into	1
the	1
federal	1
estimate	1
of	1
representation?	1
In	1
rejecting	1
them	1
altogether,	1
the	1
Constitution	1
would,	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
have	1
followed	1
the	1
very	1
laws	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
appealed	1
to	1
as	1
the	1
proper	1
guide.	1
"This	1
objection	1
is	1
repelled	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
observation.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
fundamental	1
principle	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
aggregate	1
number	1
of	1
representatives	1
allotted	1
to	1
the	1
several	1
States	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
determined	1
by	1
a	1
federal	1
rule,	1
founded	1
on	1
the	1
aggregate	1
number	1
of	1
inhabitants,	1
so	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
choosing	1
this	1
allotted	1
number	1
in	1
each	1
State	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
exercised	1
by	1
such	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
as	1
the	1
State	1
itself	1
may	1
designate.	1
The	1
qualifications	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
suffrage	1
depend	1
are	1
not,	1
perhaps,	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
any	1
two	1
States.	1
In	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
the	1
difference	1
is	1
very	1
material.	1
In	1
every	1
State,	1
a	1
certain	1
proportion	1
of	1
inhabitants	1
are	1
deprived	1
of	1
this	1
right	1
by	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
State,	1
who	1
will	1
be	1
included	1
in	1
the	1
census	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution	1
apportions	1
the	1
representatives.	1
In	1
this	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
the	1
Southern	1
States	1
might	1
retort	1
the	1
complaint,	1
by	1
insisting	1
that	1
the	1
principle	1
laid	1
down	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
required	1
that	1
no	1
regard	1
should	1
be	1
had	1
to	1
the	1
policy	1
of	1
particular	1
States	1
towards	1
their	1
own	1
inhabitants;	1
and	1
consequently,	1
that	1
the	1
slaves,	1
as	1
inhabitants,	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
admitted	1
into	1
the	1
census	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
full	1
number,	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
with	1
other	1
inhabitants,	1
who,	1
by	1
the	1
policy	1
of	1
other	1
States,	1
are	1
not	1
admitted	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
citizens.	1
A	1
rigorous	1
adherence,	1
however,	1
to	1
this	1
principle,	1
is	1
waived	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
gainers	1
by	1
it.	1
All	1
that	1
they	1
ask	1
is	1
that	1
equal	1
moderation	1
be	1
shown	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
Let	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
slaves	1
be	1
considered,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
truth,	1
a	1
peculiar	1
one.	1
Let	1
the	1
compromising	1
expedient	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
be	1
mutually	1
adopted,	1
which	1
regards	1
them	1
as	1
inhabitants,	1
but	1
as	1
debased	1
by	1
servitude	1
below	1
the	1
equal	1
level	1
of	1
free	1
inhabitants,	1
which	1
regards	1
the	1
SLAVE	1
as	1
divested	1
of	1
two	1
fifths	1
of	1
the	1
MAN.	1
"After	1
all,	1
may	1
not	1
another	1
ground	1
be	1
taken	1
on	1
which	1
this	1
article	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
will	1
admit	1
of	1
a	1
still	1
more	1
ready	1
defense?	1
We	1
have	1
hitherto	1
proceeded	1
on	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
representation	1
related	1
to	1
persons	1
only,	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
property.	1
But	1
is	1
it	1
a	1
just	1
idea?	1
Government	1
is	1
instituted	1
no	1
less	1
for	1
protection	1
of	1
the	1
property,	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
persons,	1
of	1
individuals.	1
The	1
one	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
other,	1
therefore,	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
represented	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
charged	1
with	1
the	1
government.	1
Upon	1
this	1
principle	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
in	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
and	1
particularly	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
one	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
is	1
intended	1
more	1
especially	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
guardian	1
of	1
property,	1
and	1
is	1
accordingly	1
elected	1
by	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
which	1
is	1
most	1
interested	1
in	1
this	1
object	1
of	1
government.	1
In	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution,	1
this	1
policy	1
does	1
not	1
prevail.	1
The	1
rights	1
of	1
property	1
are	1
committed	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
personal	1
rights.	1
Some	1
attention	1
ought,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
to	1
property	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
those	1
hands.	1
"For	1
another	1
reason,	1
the	1
votes	1
allowed	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
legislature	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
each	1
State,	1
ought	1
to	1
bear	1
some	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
comparative	1
wealth	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
States	1
have	1
not,	1
like	1
individuals,	1
an	1
influence	1
over	1
each	1
other,	1
arising	1
from	1
superior	1
advantages	1
of	1
fortune.	1
If	1
the	1
law	1
allows	1
an	1
opulent	1
citizen	1
but	1
a	1
single	1
vote	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
his	1
representative,	1
the	1
respect	1
and	1
consequence	1
which	1
he	1
derives	1
from	1
his	1
fortunate	1
situation	1
very	1
frequently	1
guide	1
the	1
votes	1
of	1
others	1
to	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
his	1
choice;	1
and	1
through	1
this	1
imperceptible	1
channel	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
property	1
are	1
conveyed	1
into	1
the	1
public	1
representation.	1
A	1
State	1
possesses	1
no	1
such	1
influence	1
over	1
other	1
States.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
probable	1
that	1
the	1
richest	1
State	1
in	1
the	1
Confederacy	1
will	1
ever	1
influence	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
representative	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
State.	1
Nor	1
will	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
larger	1
and	1
richer	1
States	1
possess	1
any	1
other	1
advantage	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
legislature,	1
over	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
other	1
States,	1
than	1
what	1
may	1
result	1
from	1
their	1
superior	1
number	1
alone.	1
As	1
far,	1
therefore,	1
as	1
their	1
superior	1
wealth	1
and	1
weight	1
may	1
justly	1
entitle	1
them	1
to	1
any	1
advantage,	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
secured	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
a	1
superior	1
share	1
of	1
representation.	1
The	1
new	1
Constitution	1
is,	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
materially	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
existing	1
Confederation,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
Netherlands,	1
and	1
other	1
similar	1
confederacies.	1
In	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
latter,	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
resolutions	1
depends	1
on	1
the	1
subsequent	1
and	1
voluntary	1
resolutions	1
of	1
the	1
states	1
composing	1
the	1
union.	1
Hence	1
the	1
states,	1
though	1
possessing	1
an	1
equal	1
vote	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
councils,	1
have	1
an	1
unequal	1
influence,	1
corresponding	1
with	1
the	1
unequal	1
importance	1
of	1
these	1
subsequent	1
and	1
voluntary	1
resolutions.	1
Under	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
the	1
federal	1
acts	1
will	1
take	1
effect	1
without	1
the	1
necessary	1
intervention	1
of	1
the	1
individual	1
States.	1
They	1
will	1
depend	1
merely	1
on	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
votes	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
legislature,	1
and	1
consequently	1
each	1
vote,	1
whether	1
proceeding	1
from	1
a	1
larger	1
or	1
smaller	1
State,	1
or	1
a	1
State	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
wealthy	1
or	1
powerful,	1
will	1
have	1
an	1
equal	1
weight	1
and	1
efficacy:	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
as	1
the	1
votes	1
individually	1
given	1
in	1
a	1
State	1
legislature,	1
by	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
unequal	1
counties	1
or	1
other	1
districts,	1
have	1
each	1
a	1
precise	1
equality	1
of	1
value	1
and	1
effect;	1
or	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
case,	1
it	1
proceeds	1
from	1
the	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
personal	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
individual	1
representative,	1
rather	1
than	1
from	1
any	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
comes.	1
"Such	1
is	1
the	1
reasoning	1
which	1
an	1
advocate	1
for	1
the	1
Southern	1
interests	1
might	1
employ	1
on	1
this	1
subject;	1
and	1
although	1
it	1
may	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
strained	1
in	1
some	1
points,	1
yet,	1
on	1
the	1
whole,	1
I	1
must	1
confess	1
that	1
it	1
fully	1
reconciles	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
scale	1
of	1
representation	1
which	1
the	1
convention	1
have	1
established.	1
In	1
one	1
respect,	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
measure	1
for	1
representation	1
and	1
taxation	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
salutary	1
effect.	1
As	1
the	1
accuracy	1
of	1
the	1
census	1
to	1
be	1
obtained	1
by	1
the	1
Congress	1
will	1
necessarily	1
depend,	1
in	1
a	1
considerable	1
degree	1
on	1
the	1
disposition,	1
if	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
co-operation,	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
that	1
the	1
States	1
should	1
feel	1
as	1
little	1
bias	1
as	1
possible,	1
to	1
swell	1
or	1
to	1
reduce	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
their	1
numbers.	1
Were	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
representation	1
alone	1
to	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
this	1
rule,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
exaggerating	1
their	1
inhabitants.	1
Were	1
the	1
rule	1
to	1
decide	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
taxation	1
alone,	1
a	1
contrary	1
temptation	1
would	1
prevail.	1
By	1
extending	1
the	1
rule	1
to	1
both	1
objects,	1
the	1
States	1
will	1
have	1
opposite	1
interests,	1
which	1
will	1
control	1
and	1
balance	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
produce	1
the	1
requisite	1
impartiality.	1

of	1
which	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
is	1
to	1
consist,	1
forms	1
another	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
interesting	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
under	1
which	1
this	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
legislature	1
may	1
be	1
contemplated.	1
Scarce	1
any	1
article,	1
indeed,	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
Constitution	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
rendered	1
more	1
worthy	1
of	1
attention,	1
by	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
character	1
and	1
the	1
apparent	1
force	1
of	1
argument	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
assailed.	1
The	1
charges	1
exhibited	1
against	1
it	1
are,	1
first,	1
that	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
representatives	1
will	1
be	1
an	1
unsafe	1
depositary	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
interests;	1
secondly,	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
possess	1
a	1
proper	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
local	1
circumstances	1
of	1
their	1
numerous	1
constituents;	1
thirdly,	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
that	1
class	1
of	1
citizens	1
which	1
will	1
sympathize	1
least	1
with	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
be	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
aim	1
at	1
a	1
permanent	1
elevation	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
on	1
the	1
depression	1
of	1
the	1
many;	1
fourthly,	1
that	1
defective	1
as	1
the	1
number	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
disproportionate,	1
by	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
obstacles	1
which	1
will	1
prevent	1
a	1
correspondent	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
representatives.	1
In	1
general	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
remarked	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
that	1
no	1
political	1
problem	1
is	1
less	1
susceptible	1
of	1
a	1
precise	1
solution	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
relates	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
most	1
convenient	1
for	1
a	1
representative	1
legislature;	1
nor	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
point	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
policy	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States	1
is	1
more	1
at	1
variance,	1
whether	1
we	1
compare	1
their	1
legislative	1
assemblies	1
directly	1
with	1
each	1
other,	1
or	1
consider	1
the	1
proportions	1
which	1
they	1
respectively	1
bear	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
their	1
constituents.	1
Passing	1
over	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
smallest	1
and	1
largest	1
States,	1
as	1
Delaware,	1
whose	1
most	1
numerous	1
branch	1
consists	1
of	1
twenty-one	1
representatives,	1
and	1
Massachusetts,	1
where	1
it	1
amounts	1
to	1
between	1
three	1
and	1
four	1
hundred,	1
a	1
very	1
considerable	1
difference	1
is	1
observable	1
among	1
States	1
nearly	1
equal	1
in	1
population.	1
The	1
number	1
of	1
representatives	1
in	1
Pennsylvania	1
is	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
fifth	1
of	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
last	1
mentioned.	1
New	1
York,	1
whose	1
population	1
is	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
South	1
Carolina	1
as	1
six	1
to	1
five,	1
has	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
third	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
representatives.	1
As	1
great	1
a	1
disparity	1
prevails	1
between	1
the	1
States	1
of	1
Georgia	1
and	1
Delaware	1
or	1
Rhode	1
Island.	1
In	1
Pennsylvania,	1
the	1
representatives	1
do	1
not	1
bear	1
a	1
greater	1
proportion	1
to	1
their	1
constituents	1
than	1
of	1
one	1
for	1
every	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
thousand.	1
In	1
Rhode	1
Island,	1
they	1
bear	1
a	1
proportion	1
of	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
for	1
every	1
thousand.	1
And	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
Georgia,	1
the	1
proportion	1
may	1
be	1
carried	1
to	1
one	1
to	1
every	1
ten	1
electors;	1
and	1
must	1
unavoidably	1
far	1
exceed	1
the	1
proportion	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
States.	1
Another	1
general	1
remark	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
ratio	1
between	1
the	1
representatives	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
where	1
the	1
latter	1
are	1
very	1
numerous	1
as	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
few.	1
Were	1
the	1
representatives	1
in	1
Virginia	1
to	1
be	1
regulated	1
by	1
the	1
standard	1
in	1
Rhode	1
Island,	1
they	1
would,	1
at	1
this	1
time,	1
amount	1
to	1
between	1
four	1
and	1
five	1
hundred;	1
and	1
twenty	1
or	1
thirty	1
years	1
hence,	1
to	1
a	1
thousand.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
the	1
ratio	1
of	1
Pennsylvania,	1
if	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
Delaware,	1
would	1
reduce	1
the	1
representative	1
assembly	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
to	1
seven	1
or	1
eight	1
members.	1
Nothing	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
fallacious	1
than	1
to	1
found	1
our	1
political	1
calculations	1
on	1
arithmetical	1
principles.	1
Sixty	1
or	1
seventy	1
men	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
properly	1
trusted	1
with	1
a	1
given	1
degree	1
of	1
power	1
than	1
six	1
or	1
seven.	1
But	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
follow	1
that	1
six	1
or	1
seven	1
hundred	1
would	1
be	1
proportionably	1
a	1
better	1
depositary.	1
And	1
if	1
we	1
carry	1
on	1
the	1
supposition	1
to	1
six	1
or	1
seven	1
thousand,	1
the	1
whole	1
reasoning	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
reversed.	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
at	1
least	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
benefits	1
of	1
free	1
consultation	1
and	1
discussion,	1
and	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
too	1
easy	1
a	1
combination	1
for	1
improper	1
purposes;	1
as,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
the	1
number	1
ought	1
at	1
most	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
within	1
a	1
certain	1
limit,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
confusion	1
and	1
intemperance	1
of	1
a	1
multitude.	1
In	1
all	1
very	1
numerous	1
assemblies,	1
of	1
whatever	1
character	1
composed,	1
passion	1
never	1
fails	1
to	1
wrest	1
the	1
sceptre	1
from	1
reason.	1
Had	1
every	1
Athenian	1
citizen	1
been	1
a	1
Socrates,	1
every	1
Athenian	1
assembly	1
would	1
still	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
mob.	1
It	1
is	1
necessary	1
also	1
to	1
recollect	1
here	1
the	1
observations	1
which	1
were	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
biennial	1
elections.	1
For	1
the	1
same	1
reason	1
that	1
the	1
limited	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
Congress,	1
and	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
justify	1
less	1
frequent	1
elections	1
than	1
the	1
public	1
safely	1
might	1
otherwise	1
require,	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Congress	1
need	1
be	1
less	1
numerous	1
than	1
if	1
they	1
possessed	1
the	1
whole	1
power	1
of	1
legislation,	1
and	1
were	1
under	1
no	1
other	1
than	1
the	1
ordinary	1
restraints	1
of	1
other	1
legislative	1
bodies.	1
With	1
these	1
general	1
ideas	1
in	1
our	1
mind,	1
let	1
us	1
weigh	1
the	1
objections	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
stated	1
against	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
members	1
proposed	1
for	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives.	1
It	1
is	1
said,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
that	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
number	1
cannot	1
be	1
safely	1
trusted	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
power.	1
The	1
number	1
of	1
which	1
this	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
is	1
to	1
consist,	1
at	1
the	1
outset	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
will	1
be	1
sixtyfive.	1
Within	1
three	1
years	1
a	1
census	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
taken,	1
when	1
the	1
number	1
may	1
be	1
augmented	1
to	1
one	1
for	1
every	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
inhabitants;	1
and	1
within	1
every	1
successive	1
period	1
of	1
ten	1
years	1
the	1
census	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
renewed,	1
and	1
augmentations	1
may	1
continue	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
under	1
the	1
above	1
limitation.	1
It	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
thought	1
an	1
extravagant	1
conjecture	1
that	1
the	1
first	1
census	1
will,	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
one	1
for	1
every	1
thirty	1
thousand,	1
raise	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
representatives	1
to	1
at	1
least	1
one	1
hundred.	1
Estimating	1
the	1
negroes	1
in	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
three	1
fifths,	1
it	1
can	1
scarcely	1
be	1
doubted	1
that	1
the	1
population	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
will	1
by	1
that	1
time,	1
if	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
already,	1
amount	1
to	1
three	1
millions.	1
At	1
the	1
expiration	1
of	1
twenty-five	1
years,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
computed	1
rate	1
of	1
increase,	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
representatives	1
will	1
amount	1
to	1
two	1
hundred,	1
and	1
of	1
fifty	1
years,	1
to	1
four	1
hundred.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
number	1
which,	1
I	1
presume,	1
will	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
all	1
fears	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
smallness	1
of	1
the	1
body.	1
I	1
take	1
for	1
granted	1
here	1
what	1
I	1
shall,	1
in	1
answering	1
the	1
fourth	1
objection,	1
hereafter	1
show,	1
that	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
representatives	1
will	1
be	1
augmented	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
provided	1
by	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
On	1
a	1
contrary	1
supposition,	1
I	1
should	1
admit	1
the	1
objection	1
to	1
have	1
very	1
great	1
weight	1
indeed.	1
The	1
true	1
question	1
to	1
be	1
decided	1
then	1
is,	1
whether	1
the	1
smallness	1
of	1
the	1
number,	1
as	1
a	1
temporary	1
regulation,	1
be	1
dangerous	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
liberty?	1
Whether	1
sixty-five	1
members	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
years,	1
and	1
a	1
hundred	1
or	1
two	1
hundred	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
more,	1
be	1
a	1
safe	1
depositary	1
for	1
a	1
limited	1
and	1
well-guarded	1
power	1
of	1
legislating	1
for	1
the	1
United	1
States?	1
I	1
must	1
own	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
a	1
negative	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
question,	1
without	1
first	1
obliterating	1
every	1
impression	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America,	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
actuates	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
and	1
the	1
principles	1
which	1
are	1
incorporated	1
with	1
the	1
political	1
character	1
of	1
every	1
class	1
of	1
citizens	1
I	1
am	1
unable	1
to	1
conceive	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America,	1
in	1
their	1
present	1
temper,	1
or	1
under	1
any	1
circumstances	1
which	1
can	1
speedily	1
happen,	1
will	1
choose,	1
and	1
every	1
second	1
year	1
repeat	1
the	1
choice	1
of,	1
sixty-five	1
or	1
a	1
hundred	1
men	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
form	1
and	1
pursue	1
a	1
scheme	1
of	1
tyranny	1
or	1
treachery.	1
I	1
am	1
unable	1
to	1
conceive	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
which	1
must	1
feel	1
so	1
many	1
motives	1
to	1
watch,	1
and	1
which	1
possess	1
so	1
many	1
means	1
of	1
counteracting,	1
the	1
federal	1
legislature,	1
would	1
fail	1
either	1
to	1
detect	1
or	1
to	1
defeat	1
a	1
conspiracy	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
against	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
their	1
common	1
constituents.	1
I	1
am	1
equally	1
unable	1
to	1
conceive	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
at	1
this	1
time,	1
or	1
can	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
short	1
time,	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
any	1
sixty-five	1
or	1
a	1
hundred	1
men	1
capable	1
of	1
recommending	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large,	1
who	1
would	1
either	1
desire	1
or	1
dare,	1
within	1
the	1
short	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
years,	1
to	1
betray	1
the	1
solemn	1
trust	1
committed	1
to	1
them.	1
What	1
change	1
of	1
circumstances,	1
time,	1
and	1
a	1
fuller	1
population	1
of	1
our	1
country	1
may	1
produce,	1
requires	1
a	1
prophetic	1
spirit	1
to	1
declare,	1
which	1
makes	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
pretensions.	1
But	1
judging	1
from	1
the	1
circumstances	1
now	1
before	1
us,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
probable	1
state	1
of	1
them	1
within	1
a	1
moderate	1
period	1
of	1
time,	1
I	1
must	1
pronounce	1
that	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
America	1
cannot	1
be	1
unsafe	1
in	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
hands	1
proposed	1
by	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution.	1
From	1
what	1
quarter	1
can	1
the	1
danger	1
proceed?	1
Are	1
we	1
afraid	1
of	1
foreign	1
gold?	1
If	1
foreign	1
gold	1
could	1
so	1
easily	1
corrupt	1
our	1
federal	1
rulers	1
and	1
enable	1
them	1
to	1
ensnare	1
and	1
betray	1
their	1
constituents,	1
how	1
has	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
a	1
free	1
and	1
independent	1
nation?	1
The	1
Congress	1
which	1
conducted	1
us	1
through	1
the	1
Revolution	1
was	1
a	1
less	1
numerous	1
body	1
than	1
their	1
successors	1
will	1
be;	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
chosen	1
by,	1
nor	1
responsible	1
to,	1
their	1
fellowcitizens	1
at	1
large;	1
though	1
appointed	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year,	1
and	1
recallable	1
at	1
pleasure,	1
they	1
were	1
generally	1
continued	1
for	1
three	1
years,	1
and	1
prior	1
to	1
the	1
ratification	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
articles,	1
for	1
a	1
still	1
longer	1
term.	1
They	1
held	1
their	1
consultations	1
always	1
under	1
the	1
veil	1
of	1
secrecy;	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
sole	1
transaction	1
of	1
our	1
affairs	1
with	1
foreign	1
nations;	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
more	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
than	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
hoped	1
will	1
ever	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
our	1
future	1
representatives;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
the	1
prize	1
at	1
stake,	1
and	1
the	1
eagerness	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
which	1
lost	1
it,	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
other	1
means	1
than	1
force	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
scrupled.	1
Yet	1
we	1
know	1
by	1
happy	1
experience	1
that	1
the	1
public	1
trust	1
was	1
not	1
betrayed;	1
nor	1
has	1
the	1
purity	1
of	1
our	1
public	1
councils	1
in	1
this	1
particular	1
ever	1
suffered,	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
whispers	1
of	1
calumny.	1
Is	1
the	1
danger	1
apprehended	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government?	1
But	1
where	1
are	1
the	1
means	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
by	1
the	1
President,	1
or	1
the	1
Senate,	1
or	1
both?	1
Their	1
emoluments	1
of	1
office,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
presumed,	1
will	1
not,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
previous	1
corruption	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
cannot,	1
more	1
than	1
suffice	1
for	1
very	1
different	1
purposes;	1
their	1
private	1
fortunes,	1
as	1
they	1
must	1
allbe	1
American	1
citizens,	1
cannot	1
possibly	1
be	1
sources	1
of	1
danger.	1
The	1
only	1
means,	1
then,	1
which	1
they	1
can	1
possess,	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
dispensation	1
of	1
appointments.	1
Is	1
it	1
here	1
that	1
suspicion	1
rests	1
her	1
charge?	1
Sometimes	1
we	1
are	1
told	1
that	1
this	1
fund	1
of	1
corruption	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
exhausted	1
by	1
the	1
President	1
in	1
subduing	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
the	1
Senate.	1
Now,	1
the	1
fidelity	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
House	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
victim.	1
The	1
improbability	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
mercenary	1
and	1
perfidious	1
combination	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
members	1
of	1
government,	1
standing	1
on	1
as	1
different	1
foundations	1
as	1
republican	1
principles	1
will	1
well	1
admit,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
accountable	1
to	1
the	1
society	1
over	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
placed,	1
ought	1
alone	1
to	1
quiet	1
this	1
apprehension.	1
But,	1
fortunately,	1
the	1
Constitution	1
has	1
provided	1
a	1
still	1
further	1
safeguard.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Congress	1
are	1
rendered	1
ineligible	1
to	1
any	1
civil	1
offices	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
created,	1
or	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
emoluments	1
may	1
be	1
increased,	1
during	1
the	1
term	1
of	1
their	1
election.	1
No	1
offices	1
therefore	1
can	1
be	1
dealt	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
existing	1
members	1
but	1
such	1
as	1
may	1
become	1
vacant	1
by	1
ordinary	1
casualties:	1
and	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
these	1
would	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
purchase	1
the	1
guardians	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
selected	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
themselves,	1
is	1
to	1
renounce	1
every	1
rule	1
by	1
which	1
events	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
calculated,	1
and	1
to	1
substitute	1
an	1
indiscriminate	1
and	1
unbounded	1
jealousy,	1
with	1
which	1
all	1
reasoning	1
must	1
be	1
vain.	1
The	1
sincere	1
friends	1
of	1
liberty,	1
who	1
give	1
themselves	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
extravagancies	1
of	1
this	1
passion,	1
are	1
not	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
injury	1
they	1
do	1
their	1
own	1
cause.	1
As	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
depravity	1
in	1
mankind	1
which	1
requires	1
a	1
certain	1
degree	1
of	1
circumspection	1
and	1
distrust,	1
so	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
qualities	1
in	1
human	1
nature	1
which	1
justify	1
a	1
certain	1
portion	1
of	1
esteem	1
and	1
confidence.	1
Republican	1
government	1
presupposes	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
these	1
qualities	1
in	1
a	1
higher	1
degree	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
form.	1
Were	1
the	1
pictures	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
drawn	1
by	1
the	1
political	1
jealousy	1
of	1
some	1
among	1
us	1
faithful	1
likenesses	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
character,	1
the	1
inference	1
would	1
be,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
sufficient	1
virtue	1
among	1
men	1
for	1
self-government;	1
and	1
that	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
chains	1
of	1
despotism	1
can	1
restrain	1
them	1
from	1
destroying	1
and	1
devouring	1
one	1
another.	1

To	1

People	1

New	1
York:	1
THE	1
SECOND	1
charge	1
against	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
is,	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
small	1
to	1
possess	1
a	1
due	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
its	1
constituents.	1
As	1
this	1
objection	1
evidently	1
proceeds	1
from	1
a	1
comparison	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
number	1
of	1
representatives	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
their	1
inhabitants,	1
and	1
the	1
diversity	1
of	1
their	1
interests,	1
without	1
taking	1
into	1
view	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
the	1
circumstances	1
which	1
will	1
distinguish	1
the	1
Congress	1
from	1
other	1
legislative	1
bodies,	1
the	1
best	1
answer	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
brief	1
explanation	1
of	1
these	1
peculiarities.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
sound	1
and	1
important	1
principle	1
that	1
the	1
representative	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
interests	1
and	1
circumstances	1
of	1
his	1
constituents.	1
But	1
this	1
principle	1
can	1
extend	1
no	1
further	1
than	1
to	1
those	1
circumstances	1
and	1
interests	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
authority	1
and	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
representative	1
relate.	1
An	1
ignorance	1
of	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
minute	1
and	1
particular	1
objects,	1
which	1
do	1
not	1
lie	1
within	1
the	1
compass	1
of	1
legislation,	1
is	1
consistent	1
with	1
every	1
attribute	1
necessary	1
to	1
a	1
due	1
performance	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
trust.	1
In	1
determining	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
information	1
required	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
a	1
particular	1
authority,	1
recourse	1
then	1
must	1
be	1
had	1
to	1
the	1
objects	1
within	1
the	1
purview	1
of	1
that	1
authority.	1
What	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
federal	1
legislation?	1
Those	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
most	1
importance,	1
and	1
which	1
seem	1
most	1
to	1
require	1
local	1
knowledge,	1
are	1
commerce,	1
taxation,	1
and	1
the	1
militia.	1
A	1
proper	1
regulation	1
of	1
commerce	1
requires	1
much	1
information,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
elsewhere	1
remarked;	1
but	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
this	1
information	1
relates	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
and	1
local	1
situation	1
of	1
each	1
individual	1
State,	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
representatives	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
sufficient	1
vehicles	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
councils.	1
Taxation	1
will	1
consist,	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure,	1
of	1
duties	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
involved	1
in	1
the	1
regulation	1
of	1
commerce.	1
So	1
far	1
the	1
preceding	1
remark	1
is	1
applicable	1
to	1
this	1
object.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
consist	1
of	1
internal	1
collections,	1
a	1
more	1
diffusive	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
may	1
be	1
necessary.	1
But	1
will	1
not	1
this	1
also	1
be	1
possessed	1
in	1
sufficient	1
degree	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
intelligent	1
men,	1
diffusively	1
elected	1
within	1
the	1
State?	1
Divide	1
the	1
largest	1
State	1
into	1
ten	1
or	1
twelve	1
districts,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
that	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
peculiar	1
local	1
interests	1
in	1
either,	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
within	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
district.	1
Besides	1
this	1
source	1
of	1
information,	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
State,	1
framed	1
by	1
representatives	1
from	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
it,	1
will	1
be	1
almost	1
of	1
themselves	1
a	1
sufficient	1
guide.	1
In	1
every	1
State	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
made,	1
and	1
must	1
continue	1
to	1
be	1
made,	1
regulations	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
which	1
will,	1
in	1
many	1
cases,	1
leave	1
little	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
federal	1
legislature,	1
than	1
to	1
review	1
the	1
different	1
laws,	1
and	1
reduce	1
them	1
in	1
one	1
general	1
act.	1
A	1
skillful	1
individual	1
in	1
his	1
closet	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
local	1
codes	1
before	1
him,	1
might	1
compile	1
a	1
law	1
on	1
some	1
subjects	1
of	1
taxation	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
union,	1
without	1
any	1
aid	1
from	1
oral	1
information,	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
expected	1
that	1
whenever	1
internal	1
taxes	1
may	1
be	1
necessary,	1
and	1
particularly	1
in	1
cases	1
requiring	1
uniformity	1
throughout	1
the	1
States,	1
the	1
more	1
simple	1
objects	1
will	1
be	1
preferred.	1
To	1
be	1
fully	1
sensible	1
of	1
the	1
facility	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
this	1
branch	1
of	1
federal	1
legislation	1
by	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
codes,	1
we	1
need	1
only	1
suppose	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
that	1
this	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
State	1
were	1
divided	1
into	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
parts,	1
each	1
having	1
and	1
exercising	1
within	1
itself	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
local	1
legislation.	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
evident	1
that	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
local	1
information	1
and	1
preparatory	1
labor	1
would	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
volumes	1
of	1
their	1
proceedings,	1
which	1
would	1
very	1
much	1
shorten	1
the	1
labors	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
legislature,	1
and	1
render	1
a	1
much	1
smaller	1
number	1
of	1
members	1
sufficient	1
for	1
it?	1
The	1
federal	1
councils	1
will	1
derive	1
great	1
advantage	1
from	1
another	1
circumstance.	1
The	1
representatives	1
of	1
each	1
State	1
will	1
not	1
only	1
bring	1
with	1
them	1
a	1
considerable	1
knowledge	1
of	1
its	1
laws,	1
and	1
a	1
local	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
districts,	1
but	1
will	1
probably	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
have	1
been	1
members,	1
and	1
may	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
time	1
be	1
members,	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislature,	1
where	1
all	1
the	1
local	1
information	1
and	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
are	1
assembled,	1
and	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
may	1
easily	1
be	1
conveyed	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
hands	1
into	1
the	1
legislature	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
The	1
observations	1
made	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
taxation	1
apply	1
with	1
greater	1
force	1
to	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
militia.	1
For	1
however	1
different	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
discipline	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
different	1
States,	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
same	1
throughout	1
each	1
particular	1
State;	1
and	1
depend	1
on	1
circumstances	1
which	1
can	1
differ	1
but	1
little	1
in	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
State.	1
The	1
attentive	1
reader	1
will	1
discern	1
that	1
the	1
reasoning	1
here	1
used,	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1
sufficiency	1
of	1
a	1
moderate	1
number	1
of	1
representatives,	1
does	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
respect	1
contradict	1
what	1
was	1
urged	1
on	1
another	1
occasion	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
extensive	1
information	1
which	1
the	1
representatives	1
ought	1
to	1
possess,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
necessary	1
for	1
acquiring	1
it.	1
This	1
information,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
relate	1
to	1
local	1
objects,	1
is	1
rendered	1
necessary	1
and	1
difficult,	1
not	1
by	1
a	1
difference	1
of	1
laws	1
and	1
local	1
circumstances	1
within	1
a	1
single	1
State,	1
but	1
of	1
those	1
among	1
different	1
States.	1
Taking	1
each	1
State	1
by	1
itself,	1
its	1
laws	1
are	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
its	1
interests	1
but	1
little	1
diversified.	1
A	1
few	1
men,	1
therefore,	1
will	1
possess	1
all	1
the	1
knowledge	1
requisite	1
for	1
a	1
proper	1
representation	1
of	1
them.	1
Were	1
the	1
interests	1
and	1
affairs	1
of	1
each	1
individual	1
State	1
perfectly	1
simple	1
and	1
uniform,	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
one	1
part	1
would	1
involve	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
every	1
other,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
State	1
might	1
be	1
competently	1
represented	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
member	1
taken	1
from	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
it.	1
On	1
a	1
comparison	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
States	1
together,	1
we	1
find	1
a	1
great	1
dissimilarity	1
in	1
their	1
laws,	1
and	1
in	1
many	1
other	1
circumstances	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
federal	1
legislation,	1
with	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
federal	1
representatives	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
acquaintance.	1
Whilst	1
a	1
few	1
representatives,	1
therefore,	1
from	1
each	1
State,	1
may	1
bring	1
with	1
them	1
a	1
due	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
State,	1
every	1
representative	1
will	1
have	1
much	1
information	1
to	1
acquire	1
concerning	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
States.	1
The	1
changes	1
of	1
time,	1
as	1
was	1
formerly	1
remarked,	1
on	1
the	1
comparative	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
States,	1
will	1
have	1
an	1
assimilating	1
effect.	1
The	1
effect	1
of	1
time	1
on	1
the	1
internal	1
affairs	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
taken	1
singly,	1
will	1
be	1
just	1
the	1
contrary.	1
At	1
present	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
are	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
society	1
of	1
husbandmen.	1
Few	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
made	1
much	1
progress	1
in	1
those	1
branches	1
of	1
industry	1
which	1
give	1
a	1
variety	1
and	1
complexity	1
to	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
a	1
nation.	1
These,	1
however,	1
will	1
in	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
be	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
advanced	1
population,	1
and	1
will	1
require,	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
each	1
State,	1
a	1
fuller	1
representation.	1
The	1
foresight	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
has	1
accordingly	1
taken	1
care	1
that	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
population	1
may	1
be	1
accompanied	1
with	1
a	1
proper	1
increase	1
of	1
the	1
representative	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
The	1
experience	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
which	1
presents	1
to	1
mankind	1
so	1
many	1
political	1
lessons,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
monitory	1
and	1
exemplary	1
kind,	1
and	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
frequently	1
consulted	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
inquiries,	1
corroborates	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
reflections	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
made.	1
The	1
number	1
of	1
inhabitants	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
kingdoms	1
of	1
England	1
and	1
Scotland	1
cannot	1
be	1
stated	1
at	1
less	1
than	1
eight	1
millions.	1
The	1
representatives	1
of	1
these	1
eight	1
millions	1
in	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Commons	1
amount	1
to	1
five	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty-eight.	1
Of	1
this	1
number,	1
one	1
ninth	1
are	1
elected	1
by	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty-four	1
persons,	1
and	1
one	1
half,	1
by	1
five	1
thousand	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty-three	1
persons.	1
1	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
half	1
thus	1
elected,	1
and	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
reside	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large,	1
can	1
add	1
any	1
thing	1
either	1
to	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
against	1
the	1
government,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
circumstances	1
and	1
interests	1
in	1
the	1
legislative	1
councils.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
it	1
is	1
notorious,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
frequently	1
the	1
representatives	1
and	1
instruments	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate,	1
than	1
the	1
guardians	1
and	1
advocates	1
of	1
the	1
popular	1
rights.	1
They	1
might	1
therefore,	1
with	1
great	1
propriety,	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
mere	1
deduction	1
from	1
the	1
real	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
nation.	1
We	1
will,	1
however,	1
consider	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
light	1
alone,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
extend	1
the	1
deduction	1
to	1
a	1
considerable	1
number	1
of	1
others,	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
reside	1
among	1
their	1
constitutents,	1
are	1
very	1
faintly	1
connected	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
have	1
very	1
little	1
particular	1
knowledge	1
of	1
their	1
affairs.	1
With	1
all	1
these	1
concessions,	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
seventy-nine	1
persons	1
only	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
depository	1
of	1
the	1
safety,	1
interest,	1
and	1
happiness	1
of	1
eight	1
millions	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
one	1
representative	1
only	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
rights	1
and	1
explain	1
the	1
situation	1
OF	1
TWENTY-EIGHT	1
THOUSAND	1
SIX	1
HUNDRED	1
AND	1
SEVENTY	1
constitutents,	1
in	1
an	1
assembly	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
force	1
of	1
executive	1
influence,	1
and	1
extending	1
its	1
authority	1
to	1
every	1
object	1
of	1
legislation	1
within	1
a	1
nation	1
whose	1
affairs	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
diversified	1
and	1
complicated.	1
Yet	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
certain,	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
a	1
valuable	1
portion	1
of	1
freedom	1
has	1
been	1
preserved	1
under	1
all	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
defects	1
in	1
the	1
British	1
code	1
are	1
chargeable,	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
proportion,	1
on	1
the	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
concerning	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
Allowing	1
to	1
this	1
case	1
the	1
weight	1
which	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
comparing	1
it	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
as	1
above	1
explained	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
fullest	1
assurance,	1
that	1
a	1
representative	1
for	1
every	1
THIRTY	1
THOUSAND	1

will	1
render	1
the	1
latter	1
both	1

will	1
be	1

THE	1
THIRD	1
charge	1
against	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
is,	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
that	1
class	1
of	1
citizens	1
which	1
will	1
have	1
least	1
sympathy	1
with	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
be	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
aim	1
at	1
an	1
ambitious	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
to	1
the	1
aggrandizement	1
of	1
the	1
few.	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
objections	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
framed	1
against	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution,	1
this	1
is	1
perhaps	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary.	1
Whilst	1
the	1
objection	1
itself	1
is	1
levelled	1
against	1
a	1
pretended	1
oligarchy,	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
it	1
strikes	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
root	1
of	1
republican	1
government.	1
The	1
aim	1
of	1
every	1
political	1
constitution	1
is,	1
or	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
first	1
to	1
obtain	1
for	1
rulers	1
men	1
who	1
possess	1
most	1
wisdom	1
to	1
discern,	1
and	1
most	1
virtue	1
to	1
pursue,	1
the	1
common	1
good	1
of	1
the	1
society;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
place,	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
most	1
effectual	1
precautions	1
for	1
keeping	1
them	1
virtuous	1
whilst	1
they	1
continue	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
public	1
trust.	1
The	1
elective	1
mode	1
of	1
obtaining	1
rulers	1
is	1
the	1
characteristic	1
policy	1
of	1
republican	1
government.	1
The	1
means	1
relied	1
on	1
in	1
this	1
form	1
of	1
government	1
for	1
preventing	1
their	1
degeneracy	1
are	1
numerous	1
and	1
various.	1
The	1
most	1
effectual	1
one,	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
limitation	1
of	1
the	1
term	1
of	1
appointments	1
as	1
will	1
maintain	1
a	1
proper	1
responsibility	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
Let	1
me	1
now	1
ask	1
what	1
circumstance	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
that	1
violates	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
republican	1
government,	1
or	1
favors	1
the	1
elevation	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
on	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
the	1
many?	1
Let	1
me	1
ask	1
whether	1
every	1
circumstance	1
is	1
not,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
strictly	1
conformable	1
to	1
these	1
principles,	1
and	1
scrupulously	1
impartial	1
to	1
the	1
rights	1
and	1
pretensions	1
of	1
every	1
class	1
and	1
description	1
of	1
citizens?	1
Who	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
electors	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
representatives?	1
Not	1
the	1
rich,	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
poor;	1
not	1
the	1
learned,	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
ignorant;	1
not	1
the	1
haughty	1
heirs	1
of	1
distinguished	1
names,	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
humble	1
sons	1
of	1
obscurity	1
and	1
unpropitious	1
fortune.	1
The	1
electors	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
They	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
who	1
exercise	1
the	1
right	1
in	1
every	1
State	1
of	1
electing	1
the	1
corresponding	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
of	1
the	1
State.	1
Who	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
popular	1
choice?	1
Every	1
citizen	1
whose	1
merit	1
may	1
recommend	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
esteem	1
and	1
confidence	1
of	1
his	1
country.	1
No	1
qualification	1
of	1
wealth,	1
of	1
birth,	1
of	1
religious	1
faith,	1
or	1
of	1
civil	1
profession	1
is	1
permitted	1
to	1
fetter	1
the	1
judgement	1
or	1
disappoint	1
the	1
inclination	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
If	1
we	1
consider	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
whom	1
the	1
free	1
suffrages	1
of	1
their	1
fellow-citizens	1
may	1
confer	1
the	1
representative	1
trust,	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
it	1
involving	1
every	1
security	1
which	1
can	1
be	1
devised	1
or	1
desired	1
for	1
their	1
fidelity	1
to	1
their	1
constituents.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
as	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
been	1
distinguished	1
by	1
the	1
preference	1
of	1
their	1
fellow-citizens,	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
presume	1
that	1
in	1
general	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
somewhat	1
distinguished	1
also	1
by	1
those	1
qualities	1
which	1
entitle	1
them	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
which	1
promise	1
a	1
sincere	1
and	1
scrupulous	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
their	1
engagements.	1
In	1
the	1
second	1
place,	1
they	1
will	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
public	1
service	1
under	1
circumstances	1
which	1
cannot	1
fail	1
to	1
produce	1
a	1
temporary	1
affection	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
their	1
constituents.	1
There	1
is	1
in	1
every	1
breast	1
a	1
sensibility	1
to	1
marks	1
of	1
honor,	1
of	1
favor,	1
of	1
esteem,	1
and	1
of	1
confidence,	1
which,	1
apart	1
from	1
all	1
considerations	1
of	1
interest,	1
is	1
some	1
pledge	1
for	1
grateful	1
and	1
benevolent	1
returns.	1
Ingratitude	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
topic	1
of	1
declamation	1
against	1
human	1
nature;	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
confessed	1
that	1
instances	1
of	1
it	1
are	1
but	1
too	1
frequent	1
and	1
flagrant,	1
both	1
in	1
public	1
and	1
in	1
private	1
life.	1
But	1
the	1
universal	1
and	1
extreme	1
indignation	1
which	1
it	1
inspires	1
is	1
itself	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
energy	1
and	1
prevalence	1
of	1
the	1
contrary	1
sentiment.	1
In	1
the	1
third	1
place,	1
those	1
ties	1
which	1
bind	1
the	1
representative	1
to	1
his	1
constituents	1
are	1
strengthened	1
by	1
motives	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
selfish	1
nature.	1
His	1
pride	1
and	1
vanity	1
attach	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
government	1
which	1
favors	1
his	1
pretensions	1
and	1
gives	1
him	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
its	1
honors	1
and	1
distinctions.	1
Whatever	1
hopes	1
or	1
projects	1
might	1
be	1
entertained	1
by	1
a	1
few	1
aspiring	1
characters,	1
it	1
must	1
generally	1
happen	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
deriving	1
their	1
advancement	1
from	1
their	1
influence	1
with	1
the	1
people,	1
would	1
have	1
more	1
to	1
hope	1
from	1
a	1
preservation	1
of	1
the	1
favor,	1
than	1
from	1
innovations	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
subversive	1
of	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
All	1
these	1
securities,	1
however,	1
would	1
be	1
found	1
very	1
insufficient	1
without	1
the	1
restraint	1
of	1
frequent	1
elections.	1
Hence,	1
in	1
the	1
fourth	1
place,	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
is	1
so	1
constituted	1
as	1
to	1
support	1
in	1
the	1
members	1
an	1
habitual	1
recollection	1
of	1
their	1
dependence	1
on	1
the	1
people.	1
Before	1
the	1
sentiments	1
impressed	1
on	1
their	1
minds	1
by	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
their	1
elevation	1
can	1
be	1
effaced	1
by	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
power,	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
compelled	1
to	1
anticipate	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
their	1
power	1
is	1
to	1
cease,	1
when	1
their	1
exercise	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
reviewed,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
must	1
descend	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
raised;	1
there	1
forever	1
to	1
remain	1
unless	1
a	1
faithful	1
discharge	1
of	1
their	1
trust	1
shall	1
have	1
established	1
their	1
title	1
to	1
a	1
renewal	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
will	1
add,	1
as	1
a	1
fifth	1
circumstance	1
in	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
restraining	1
them	1
from	1
oppressive	1
measures,	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
make	1
no	1
law	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
its	1
full	1
operation	1
on	1
themselves	1
and	1
their	1
friends,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
great	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
society.	1
This	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
deemed	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
strongest	1
bonds	1
by	1
which	1
human	1
policy	1
can	1
connect	1
the	1
rulers	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
together.	1
It	1
creates	1
between	1
them	1
that	1
communion	1
of	1
interests	1
and	1
sympathy	1
of	1
sentiments,	1
of	1
which	1
few	1
governments	1
have	1
furnished	1
examples;	1
but	1
without	1
which	1
every	1
government	1
degenerates	1
into	1
tyranny.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
asked,	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
restrain	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
from	1
making	1
legal	1
discriminations	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
themselves	1
and	1
a	1
particular	1
class	1
of	1
the	1
society?	1
I	1
answer:	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
system;	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
just	1
and	1
constitutional	1
laws;	1
and	1
above	1
all,	1
the	1
vigilant	1
and	1
manly	1
spirit	1
which	1
actuates	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America,	1
a	1
spirit	1
which	1
nourishes	1
freedom,	1
and	1
in	1
return	1
is	1
nourished	1
by	1
it.	1
If	1
this	1
spirit	1
shall	1
ever	1
be	1
so	1
far	1
debased	1
as	1
to	1
tolerate	1
a	1
law	1
not	1
obligatory	1
on	1
the	1
legislature,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
be	1
prepared	1
to	1
tolerate	1
any	1
thing	1
but	1
liberty.	1
Such	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
relation	1
between	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
and	1
their	1
constituents.	1
Duty,	1
gratitude,	1
interest,	1
ambition	1
itself,	1
are	1
the	1
chords	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
bound	1
to	1
fidelity	1
and	1
sympathy	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
It	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
these	1
may	1
all	1
be	1
insufficient	1
to	1
control	1
the	1
caprice	1
and	1
wickedness	1
of	1
man.	1
But	1
are	1
they	1
not	1
all	1
that	1
government	1
will	1
admit,	1
and	1
that	1
human	1
prudence	1
can	1
devise?	1
Are	1
they	1
not	1
the	1
genuine	1
and	1
the	1
characteristic	1
means	1
by	1
which	1
republican	1
government	1
provides	1
for	1
the	1
liberty	1
and	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
people?	1
Are	1
they	1
not	1
the	1
identical	1
means	1
on	1
which	1
every	1
State	1
government	1
in	1
the	1
Union	1
relies	1
for	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
these	1
important	1
ends?	1
What	1
then	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
understand	1
by	1
the	1
objection	1
which	1
this	1
paper	1
has	1
combated?	1
What	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
profess	1
the	1
most	1
flaming	1
zeal	1
for	1
republican	1
government,	1
yet	1
boldly	1
impeach	1
the	1
fundamental	1
principle	1
of	1
it;	1
who	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
champions	1
for	1
the	1
right	1
and	1
the	1
capacity	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
choose	1
their	1
own	1
rulers,	1
yet	1
maintain	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
prefer	1
those	1
only	1
who	1
will	1
immediately	1
and	1
infallibly	1
betray	1
the	1
trust	1
committed	1
to	1
them?	1
Were	1
the	1
objection	1
to	1
be	1
read	1
by	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
the	1
mode	1
prescribed	1
by	1
the	1
Constitution	1
for	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
representatives,	1
he	1
could	1
suppose	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
that	1
some	1
unreasonable	1
qualification	1
of	1
property	1
was	1
annexed	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
suffrage;	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
eligibility	1
was	1
limited	1
to	1
persons	1
of	1
particular	1
families	1
or	1
fortunes;	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
the	1
mode	1
prescribed	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
was	1
in	1
some	1
respect	1
or	1
other,	1
very	1
grossly	1
departed	1
from.	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
how	1
far	1
such	1
a	1
supposition	1
would	1
err,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
first	1
points.	1
Nor	1
would	1
it,	1
in	1
fact,	1
be	1
less	1
erroneous	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
last.	1
The	1
only	1
difference	1
discoverable	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
cases	1
is,	1
that	1
each	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
will	1
be	1
elected	1
by	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
thousand	1
citizens;	1
whilst	1
in	1
the	1
individual	1
States,	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
a	1
representative	1
is	1
left	1
to	1
about	1
as	1
many	1
hundreds.	1
Will	1
it	1
be	1
pretended	1
that	1
this	1
difference	1
is	1
sufficient	1
to	1
justify	1
an	1
attachment	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
and	1
an	1
abhorrence	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
government?	1
If	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
point	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
objection	1
turns,	1
it	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
examined.	1
Is	1
it	1
supported	1
by	1
REASON?	1
This	1
cannot	1
be	1
said,	1
without	1
maintaining	1
that	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
thousand	1
citizens	1
are	1
less	1
capable	1
of	1
choosing	1
a	1
fit	1
representative,	1
or	1
more	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
corrupted	1
by	1
an	1
unfit	1
one,	1
than	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
hundred.	1
Reason,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
assures	1
us,	1
that	1
as	1
in	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
number	1
a	1
fit	1
representative	1
would	1
be	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
found,	1
so	1
the	1
choice	1
would	1
be	1
less	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
diverted	1
from	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
intrigues	1
of	1
the	1
ambitious	1
or	1
the	1
ambitious	1
or	1
the	1
bribes	1
of	1
the	1
rich.	1
Is	1
the	1
CONSEQUENCE	1
from	1
this	1
doctrine	1
admissible?	1
If	1
we	1
say	1
that	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
hundred	1
citizens	1
are	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
can	1
jointly	1
exercise	1
their	1
right	1
of	1
suffrage,	1
must	1
we	1
not	1
deprive	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
immediate	1
choice	1
of	1
their	1
public	1
servants,	1
in	1
every	1
instance	1
where	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
does	1
not	1
require	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
will	1
amount	1
to	1
one	1
for	1
that	1
number	1
of	1
citizens?	1
Is	1
the	1
doctrine	1
warranted	1
by	1
FACTS?	1
It	1
was	1
shown	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
paper,	1
that	1
the	1
real	1
representation	1
in	1
the	1
British	1
House	1
of	1
Commons	1
very	1
little	1
exceeds	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
one	1
for	1
every	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
inhabitants.	1
Besides	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
powerful	1
causes	1
not	1
existing	1
here,	1
and	1
which	1
favor	1
in	1
that	1
country	1
the	1
pretensions	1
of	1
rank	1
and	1
wealth,	1
no	1
person	1
is	1
eligible	1
as	1
a	1
representative	1
of	1
a	1
county,	1
unless	1
he	1
possess	1
real	1
estate	1
of	1
the	1
clear	1
value	1
of	1
six	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
sterling	1
per	1
year;	1
nor	1
of	1
a	1
city	1
or	1
borough,	1
unless	1
he	1
possess	1
a	1
like	1
estate	1
of	1
half	1
that	1
annual	1
value.	1
To	1
this	1
qualification	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
county	1
representatives	1
is	1
added	1
another	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
county	1
electors,	1
which	1
restrains	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
suffrage	1
to	1
persons	1
having	1
a	1
freehold	1
estate	1
of	1
the	1
annual	1
value	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
twenty	1
pounds	1
sterling,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
rate	1
of	1
money.	1
Notwithstanding	1
these	1
unfavorable	1
circumstances,	1
and	1
notwithstanding	1
some	1
very	1
unequal	1
laws	1
in	1
the	1
British	1
code,	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
have	1
elevated	1
the	1
few	1
on	1
the	1
ruins	1
of	1
the	1
many.	1
But	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
resort	1
to	1
foreign	1
experience	1
on	1
this	1
subject.	1
Our	1
own	1
is	1
explicit	1
and	1
decisive.	1
The	1
districts	1
in	1
New	1
Hampshire	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
senators	1
are	1
chosen	1
immediately	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
are	1
nearly	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
for	1
her	1
representatives	1
in	1
the	1
Congress.	1
Those	1
of	1
Massachusetts	1
are	1
larger	1
than	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
for	1
that	1
purpose;	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
still	1
more	1
so.	1
In	1
the	1
last	1
State	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
Assembly	1
for	1
the	1
cities	1
and	1
counties	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
and	1
Albany	1
are	1
elected	1
by	1
very	1
nearly	1
as	1
many	1
voters	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
entitled	1
to	1
a	1
representative	1
in	1
the	1
Congress,	1
calculating	1
on	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
sixty-five	1
representatives	1
only.	1
It	1
makes	1
no	1
difference	1
that	1
in	1
these	1
senatorial	1
districts	1
and	1
counties	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
representatives	1
are	1
voted	1
for	1
by	1
each	1
elector	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
If	1
the	1
same	1
electors	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
are	1
capable	1
of	1
choosing	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
representatives,	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
incapable	1
of	1
choosing	1
one.	1
Pennsylvania	1
is	1
an	1
additional	1
example.	1
Some	1
of	1
her	1
counties,	1
which	1
elect	1
her	1
State	1
representatives,	1
are	1
almost	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
her	1
districts	1
will	1
be	1
by	1
which	1
her	1
federal	1
representatives	1
will	1
be	1
elected.	1
The	1
city	1
of	1
Philadelphia	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
contain	1
between	1
fifty	1
and	1
sixty	1
thousand	1
souls.	1
It	1
will	1
therefore	1
form	1
nearly	1
two	1
districts	1
for	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
federal	1
representatives.	1
It	1
forms,	1
however,	1
but	1
one	1
county,	1
in	1
which	1
every	1
elector	1
votes	1
for	1
each	1
of	1
its	1
representatives	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
legislature.	1
And	1
what	1
may	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
still	1
more	1
directly	1
to	1
our	1
purpose,	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
actually	1
elects	1
a	1
SINGLE	1
MEMBER	1
for	1
the	1
executive	1
council.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
counties	1
of	1
the	1
State.	1
Are	1
not	1
these	1
facts	1
the	1
most	1
satisfactory	1
proofs	1
of	1
the	1
fallacy	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
employed	1
against	1
the	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
under	1
consideration?	1
Has	1
it	1
appeared	1
on	1
trial	1
that	1
the	1
senators	1
of	1
New	1
Hampshire,	1
Massachusetts,	1
and	1
New	1
York,	1
or	1
the	1
executive	1
council	1
of	1
Pennsylvania,	1
or	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Assembly	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
last	1
States,	1
have	1
betrayed	1
any	1
peculiar	1
disposition	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
the	1
many	1
to	1
the	1
few,	1
or	1
are	1
in	1
any	1
respect	1
less	1
worthy	1
of	1
their	1
places	1
than	1
the	1
representatives	1
and	1
magistrates	1
appointed	1
in	1
other	1
States	1
by	1
very	1
small	1
divisions	1
of	1
the	1
people?	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
cases	1
of	1
a	1
stronger	1
complexion	1
than	1
any	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
yet	1
quoted.	1
One	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
of	1
Connecticut	1
is	1
so	1
constituted	1
that	1
each	1
member	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
elected	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
State.	1
So	1
is	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
that	1
State,	1
of	1
Massachusetts,	1
and	1
of	1
this	1
State,	1
and	1
the	1
president	1
of	1
New	1
Hampshire.	1
I	1
leave	1
every	1
man	1
to	1
decide	1
whether	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
experiments	1
can	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
countenance	1
a	1
suspicion,	1
that	1
a	1
diffusive	1
mode	1
of	1
choosing	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
tends	1
to	1
elevate	1
traitors	1
and	1
to	1
undermine	1
the	1
public	1
liberty.	1

Objection	1
That	1
The	1

THE	1
remaining	1
charge	1
against	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
examine,	1
is	1
grounded	1
on	1
a	1
supposition	1
that	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
members	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
augmented	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
as	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
population	1
may	1
demand.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
admitted,	1
that	1
this	1
objection,	1
if	1
well	1
supported,	1
would	1
have	1
great	1
weight.	1
The	1
following	1
observations	1
will	1
show	1
that,	1
like	1
most	1
other	1
objections	1
against	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
it	1
can	1
only	1
proceed	1
from	1
a	1
partial	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
subject,	1
or	1
from	1
a	1
jealousy	1
which	1
discolors	1
and	1
disfigures	1
every	1
object	1
which	1
is	1
beheld.	1
1.	1
Those	1
who	1
urge	1
the	1
objection	1
seem	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
recollected	1
that	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
by	1
a	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
in	1
the	1
security	1
provided	1
for	1
a	1
gradual	1
augmentation	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
representatives.	1
The	1
number	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
prevail	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance	1
is	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
temporary.	1
Its	1
duration	1
is	1
limited	1
to	1
the	1
short	1
term	1
of	1
three	1
years.	1
Within	1
every	1
successive	1
term	1
of	1
ten	1
years	1
a	1
census	1
of	1
inhabitants	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
repeated.	1
The	1
unequivocal	1
objects	1
of	1
these	1
regulations	1
are,	1
first,	1
to	1
readjust,	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
the	1
apportionment	1
of	1
representatives	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
inhabitants,	1
under	1
the	1
single	1
exception	1
that	1
each	1
State	1
shall	1
have	1
one	1
representative	1
at	1
least;	1
secondly,	1
to	1
augment	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
representatives	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
periods,	1
under	1
the	1
sole	1
limitation	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
number	1
shall	1
not	1
exceed	1
one	1
for	1
every	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
inhabitants.	1
If	1
we	1
review	1
the	1
constitutions	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
contain	1
no	1
determinate	1
regulations	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
that	1
others	1
correspond	1
pretty	1
much	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
with	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
effectual	1
security	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
resolvable	1
into	1
a	1
mere	1
directory	1
provision.	1
2.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
experience	1
has	1
taken	1
place	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
a	1
gradual	1
increase	1
of	1
representatives	1
under	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
has	1
at	1
least	1
kept	1
pace	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
constituents,	1
and	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
the	1
former	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
ready	1
to	1
concur	1
in	1
such	1
measures	1
as	1
the	1
latter	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
call	1
for	1
them.	1
3.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
peculiarity	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution	1
which	1
insures	1
a	1
watchful	1
attention	1
in	1
a	1
majority	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
representatives	1
to	1
a	1
constitutional	1
augmentation	1
of	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
peculiarity	1
lies	1
in	1
this,	1
that	1
one	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
is	1
a	1
representation	1
of	1
citizens,	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
States:	1
in	1
the	1
former,	1
consequently,	1
the	1
larger	1
States	1
will	1
have	1
most	1
weight;	1
in	1
the	1
latter,	1
the	1
advantage	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
smaller	1
States.	1
From	1
this	1
circumstance	1
it	1
may	1
with	1
certainty	1
be	1
inferred	1
that	1
the	1
larger	1
States	1
will	1
be	1
strenuous	1
advocates	1
for	1
increasing	1
the	1
number	1
and	1
weight	1
of	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
in	1
which	1
their	1
influence	1
predominates.	1
And	1
it	1
so	1
happens	1
that	1
four	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
votes	1
in	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives.	1
Should	1
the	1
representatives	1
or	1
people,	1
therefore,	1
of	1
the	1
smaller	1
States	1
oppose	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
a	1
reasonable	1
addition	1
of	1
members,	1
a	1
coalition	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
States	1
will	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
overrule	1
the	1
opposition;	1
a	1
coalition	1
which,	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
rivalship	1
and	1
local	1
prejudices	1
which	1
might	1
prevent	1
it	1
on	1
ordinary	1
occasions,	1
would	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
take	1
place,	1
when	1
not	1
merely	1
prompted	1
by	1
common	1
interest,	1
but	1
justified	1
by	1
equity	1
and	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
alleged,	1
perhaps,	1
that	1
the	1
Senate	1
would	1
be	1
prompted	1
by	1
like	1
motives	1
to	1
an	1
adverse	1
coalition;	1
and	1
as	1
their	1
concurrence	1
would	1
be	1
indispensable,	1
the	1
just	1
and	1
constitutional	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
branch	1
might	1
be	1
defeated.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
difficulty	1
which	1
has	1
probably	1
created	1
the	1
most	1
serious	1
apprehensions	1
in	1
the	1
jealous	1
friends	1
of	1
a	1
numerous	1
representation.	1
Fortunately	1
it	1
is	1
among	1
the	1
difficulties	1
which,	1
existing	1
only	1
in	1
appearance,	1
vanish	1
on	1
a	1
close	1
and	1
accurate	1
inspection.	1
The	1
following	1
reflections	1
will,	1
if	1
I	1
mistake	1
not,	1
be	1
admitted	1
to	1
be	1
conclusive	1
and	1
satisfactory	1
on	1
this	1
point.	1
Notwithstanding	1
the	1
equal	1
authority	1
which	1
will	1
subsist	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
houses	1
on	1
all	1
legislative	1
subjects,	1
except	1
the	1
originating	1
of	1
money	1
bills,	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
doubted	1
that	1
the	1
House,	1
composed	1
of	1
the	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
members,	1
when	1
supported	1
by	1
the	1
more	1
powerful	1
States,	1
and	1
speaking	1
the	1
known	1
and	1
determined	1
sense	1
of	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
small	1
advantage	1
in	1
a	1
question	1
depending	1
on	1
the	1
comparative	1
firmness	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
houses.	1
This	1
advantage	1
must	1
be	1
increased	1
by	1
the	1
consciousness,	1
felt	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
side	1
of	1
being	1
supported	1
in	1
its	1
demands	1
by	1
right,	1
by	1
reason,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
Constitution;	1
and	1
the	1
consciousness,	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side,	1
of	1
contending	1
against	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
solemn	1
considerations.	1
It	1
is	1
farther	1
to	1
be	1
considered,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
gradation	1
between	1
the	1
smallest	1
and	1
largest	1
States,	1
there	1
are	1
several,	1
which,	1
though	1
most	1
likely	1
in	1
general	1
to	1
arrange	1
themselves	1
among	1
the	1
former	1
are	1
too	1
little	1
removed	1
in	1
extent	1
and	1
population	1
from	1
the	1
latter,	1
to	1
second	1
an	1
opposition	1
to	1
their	1
just	1
and	1
legitimate	1
pretensions.	1
Hence	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
certain	1
that	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
votes,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
Senate,	1
would	1
be	1
unfriendly	1
to	1
proper	1
augmentations	1
in	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
representatives.	1
It	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
looking	1
too	1
far	1
to	1
add,	1
that	1
the	1
senators	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
new	1
States	1
may	1
be	1
gained	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
just	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
by	1
an	1
expedient	1
too	1
obvious	1
to	1
be	1
overlooked.	1
As	1
these	1
States	1
will,	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
length	1
of	1
time,	1
advance	1
in	1
population	1
with	1
peculiar	1
rapidity,	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
interested	1
in	1
frequent	1
reapportionments	1
of	1
the	1
representatives	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
inhabitants.	1
The	1
large	1
States,	1
therefore,	1
who	1
will	1
prevail	1
in	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
reapportionments	1
and	1
augmentations	1
mutually	1
conditions	1
of	1
each	1
other;	1
and	1
the	1
senators	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
most	1
growing	1
States	1
will	1
be	1
bound	1
to	1
contend	1
for	1
the	1
latter,	1
by	1
the	1
interest	1
which	1
their	1
States	1
will	1
feel	1
in	1
the	1
former.	1
These	1
considerations	1
seem	1
to	1
afford	1
ample	1
security	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
and	1
ought	1
alone	1
to	1
satisfy	1
all	1
the	1
doubts	1
and	1
fears	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
indulged	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
it.	1
Admitting,	1
however,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
all	1
be	1
insufficient	1
to	1
subdue	1
the	1
unjust	1
policy	1
of	1
the	1
smaller	1
States,	1
or	1
their	1
predominant	1
influence	1
in	1
the	1
councils	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
a	1
constitutional	1
and	1
infallible	1
resource	1
still	1
remains	1
with	1
the	1
larger	1
States,	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
to	1
accomplish	1
their	1
just	1
purposes.	1
The	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
cannot	1
only	1
refuse,	1
but	1
they	1
alone	1
can	1
propose,	1
the	1
supplies	1
requisite	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
government.	1
They,	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
hold	1
the	1
purse	1
that	1
powerful	1
instrument	1
by	1
which	1
we	1
behold,	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
Constitution,	1
an	1
infant	1
and	1
humble	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
gradually	1
enlarging	1
the	1
sphere	1
of	1
its	1
activity	1
and	1
importance,	1
and	1
finally	1
reducing,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
wished,	1
all	1
the	1
overgrown	1
prerogatives	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
This	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
purse	1
may,	1
in	1
fact,	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
complete	1
and	1
effectual	1
weapon	1
with	1
which	1
any	1
constitution	1
can	1
arm	1
the	1
immediate	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
for	1
obtaining	1
a	1
redress	1
of	1
every	1
grievance,	1
and	1
for	1
carrying	1
into	1
effect	1
every	1
just	1
and	1
salutary	1
measure.	1
But	1
will	1
not	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
interested	1
as	1
the	1
Senate	1
in	1
maintaining	1
the	1
government	1
in	1
its	1
proper	1
functions,	1
and	1
will	1
they	1
not	1
therefore	1
be	1
unwilling	1
to	1
stake	1
its	1
existence	1
or	1
its	1
reputation	1
on	1
the	1
pliancy	1
of	1
the	1
Senate?	1
Or,	1
if	1
such	1
a	1
trial	1
of	1
firmness	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
branches	1
were	1
hazarded,	1
would	1
not	1
the	1
one	1
be	1
as	1
likely	1
first	1
to	1
yield	1
as	1
the	1
other?	1
These	1
questions	1
will	1
create	1
no	1
difficulty	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
reflect	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
the	1
smaller	1
the	1
number,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
permanent	1
and	1
conspicuous	1
the	1
station,	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
power,	1
the	1
stronger	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
interest	1
which	1
they	1
will	1
individually	1
feel	1
in	1
whatever	1
concerns	1
the	1
government.	1
Those	1
who	1
represent	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
their	1
country	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
other	1
nations,	1
will	1
be	1
particularly	1
sensible	1
to	1
every	1
prospect	1
of	1
public	1
danger,	1
or	1
of	1
dishonorable	1
stagnation	1
in	1
public	1
affairs.	1
To	1
those	1
causes	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
ascribe	1
the	1
continual	1
triumph	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
House	1
of	1
Commons	1
over	1
the	1
other	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
whenever	1
the	1
engine	1
of	1
a	1
money	1
bill	1
has	1
been	1
employed.	1
An	1
absolute	1
inflexibility	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
latter,	1
although	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
involve	1
every	1
department	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
confusion,	1
has	1
neither	1
been	1
apprehended	1
nor	1
experienced.	1
The	1
utmost	1
degree	1
of	1
firmness	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
displayed	1
by	1
the	1
federal	1
Senate	1
or	1
President,	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
equal	1
to	1
a	1
resistance	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
supported	1
by	1
constitutional	1
and	1
patriotic	1
principles.	1
In	1
this	1
review	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
I	1
have	1
passed	1
over	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
economy,	1
which,	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
affairs,	1
might	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
effect	1
in	1
lessening	1
the	1
temporary	1
number	1
of	1
representatives,	1
and	1
a	1
disregard	1
of	1
which	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
rich	1
a	1
theme	1
of	1
declamation	1
against	1
the	1
Constitution	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
shown	1
by	1
the	1
smallness	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
proposed.	1
I	1
omit	1
also	1
any	1
remarks	1
on	1
the	1
difficulty	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
found,	1
under	1
present	1
circumstances,	1
in	1
engaging	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
service	1
a	1
large	1
number	1
of	1
such	1
characters	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
will	1
probably	1
elect.	1
One	1
observation,	1
however,	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
permitted	1
to	1
add	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
as	1
claiming,	1
in	1
my	1
judgment,	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
attention.	1
It	1
is,	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
legislative	1
assemblies	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
number	1
composing	1
them	1
may	1
be,	1
the	1
fewer	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
will	1
in	1
fact	1
direct	1
their	1
proceedings.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
the	1
more	1
numerous	1
an	1
assembly	1
may	1
be,	1
of	1
whatever	1
characters	1
composed,	1
the	1
greater	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
ascendency	1
of	1
passion	1
over	1
reason.	1
In	1
the	1
next	1
place,	1
the	1
larger	1
the	1
number,	1
the	1
greater	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
members	1
of	1
limited	1
information	1
and	1
of	1
weak	1
capacities.	1
Now,	1
it	1
is	1
precisely	1
on	1
characters	1
of	1
this	1
description	1
that	1
the	1
eloquence	1
and	1
address	1
of	1
the	1
few	1
are	1
known	1
to	1
act	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
force.	1
In	1
the	1
ancient	1
republics,	1
where	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
assembled	1
in	1
person,	1
a	1
single	1
orator,	1
or	1
an	1
artful	1
statesman,	1
was	1
generally	1
seen	1
to	1
rule	1
with	1
as	1
complete	1
a	1
sway	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
sceptre	1
had	1
been	1
placed	1
in	1
his	1
single	1
hand.	1
On	1
the	1
same	1
principle,	1
the	1
more	1
multitudinous	1
a	1
representative	1
assembly	1
may	1
be	1
rendered,	1
the	1
more	1
it	1
will	1
partake	1
of	1
the	1
infirmities	1
incident	1
to	1
collective	1
meetings	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
Ignorance	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
dupe	1
of	1
cunning,	1
and	1
passion	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
sophistry	1
and	1
declamation.	1
The	1
people	1
can	1
never	1
err	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
supposing	1
that	1
by	1
multiplying	1
their	1
representatives	1
beyond	1
a	1
certain	1
limit,	1
they	1
strengthen	1
the	1
barrier	1
against	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
a	1
few.	1
Experience	1
will	1
forever	1
admonish	1
them	1
that,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
AFTER	1
SECURING	1
A	1
SUFFICIENT	1
NUMBER	1
FOR	1
THE	1
PURPOSES	1
OF	1
SAFETY,	1
OF	1
LOCAL	1
INFORMATION,	1
AND	1
OF	1
DIFFUSIVE	1
SYMPATHY	1
WITH	1
THE	1
WHOLE	1
SOCIETY,	1
they	1
will	1
counteract	1
their	1
own	1
views	1
by	1
every	1
addition	1
to	1
their	1
representatives.	1
The	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
may	1
become	1
more	1
democratic,	1
but	1
the	1
soul	1
that	1
animates	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
oligarchic.	1
The	1
machine	1
will	1
be	1
enlarged,	1
but	1
the	1
fewer,	1
and	1
often	1
the	1
more	1
secret,	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
springs	1
by	1
which	1
its	1
motions	1
are	1
directed.	1
As	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
objection	1
against	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
representatives,	1
may	1
properly	1
be	1
here	1
noticed,	1
that	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
suggested	1
against	1
the	1
number	1
made	1
competent	1
for	1
legislative	1
business.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
majority	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
required	1
for	1
a	1
quorum;	1
and	1
in	1
particular	1
cases,	1
if	1
not	1
in	1
all,	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
a	1
quorum	1
for	1
a	1
decision.	1
That	1
some	1
advantages	1
might	1
have	1
resulted	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
precaution,	1
cannot	1
be	1
denied.	1
It	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
additional	1
shield	1
to	1
some	1
particular	1
interests,	1
and	1
another	1
obstacle	1
generally	1
to	1
hasty	1
and	1
partial	1
measures.	1
But	1
these	1
considerations	1
are	1
outweighed	1
by	1
the	1
inconveniences	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
scale.	1
In	1
all	1
cases	1
where	1
justice	1
or	1
the	1
general	1
good	1
might	1
require	1
new	1
laws	1
to	1
be	1
passed,	1
or	1
active	1
measures	1
to	1
be	1
pursued,	1
the	1
fundamental	1
principle	1
of	1
free	1
government	1
would	1
be	1
reversed.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
majority	1
that	1
would	1
rule:	1
the	1
power	1
would	1
be	1
transferred	1
to	1
the	1
minority.	1
Were	1
the	1
defensive	1
privilege	1
limited	1
to	1
particular	1
cases,	1
an	1
interested	1
minority	1
might	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
screen	1
themselves	1
from	1
equitable	1
sacrifices	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
weal,	1
or,	1
in	1
particular	1
emergencies,	1
to	1
extort	1
unreasonable	1
indulgences.	1
Lastly,	1
it	1
would	1
facilitate	1
and	1
foster	1
the	1
baneful	1
practice	1
of	1
secessions;	1
a	1
practice	1
which	1
has	1
shown	1
itself	1
even	1
in	1
States	1
where	1
a	1
majority	1
only	1
is	1
required;	1
a	1
practice	1
subversive	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
order	1
and	1
regular	1
government;	1
a	1
practice	1
which	1
leads	1
more	1
directly	1
to	1
public	1
convulsions,	1
and	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
popular	1
governments,	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
which	1
has	1
yet	1
been	1
displayed	1
among	1
us.	1

To	1

New	1
York:	1
THE	1
natural	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
leads	1
us	1
to	1
consider,	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
that	1
provision	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
which	1
authorizes	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
to	1
regulate,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
resort,	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
members.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
these	1
words:	1
"The	1
TIMES,	1
PLACES,	1
and	1
MANNER	1
of	1
holding	1
elections	1
for	1
senators	1
and	1
representatives	1
shall	1
be	1
prescribed	1
in	1
each	1
State	1
by	1
the	1
legislature	1
thereof;	1
but	1
the	1
Congress	1
may,	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
by	1
law,	1
make	1
or	1
alter	1
SUCH	1
REGULATIONS,	1
except	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
PLACES	1
of	1
choosing	1
senators.	1
"1	1
This	1
provision	1
has	1
not	1
only	1
been	1
declaimed	1
against	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
condemn	1
the	1
Constitution	1
in	1
the	1
gross,	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
censured	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
objected	1
with	1
less	1
latitude	1
and	1
greater	1
moderation;	1
and,	1
in	1
one	1
instance	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
thought	1
exceptionable	1
by	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
has	1
declared	1
himself	1
the	1
advocate	1
of	1
every	1
other	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
system.	1
I	1
am	1
greatly	1
mistaken,	1
notwithstanding,	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
article	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
plan	1
more	1
completely	1
defensible	1
than	1
this.	1
Its	1
propriety	1
rests	1
upon	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
this	1
plain	1
proposition,	1
that	1
EVERY	1
GOVERNMENT	1
OUGHT	1
TO	1
CONTAIN	1
IN	1
ITSELF	1
THE	1
MEANS	1
OF	1
ITS	1
OWN	1
PRESERVATION.	1
Every	1
just	1
reasoner	1
will,	1
at	1
first	1
sight,	1
approve	1
an	1
adherence	1
to	1
this	1
rule,	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
convention;	1
and	1
will	1
disapprove	1
every	1
deviation	1
from	1
it	1
which	1
may	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
dictated	1
by	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
incorporating	1
into	1
the	1
work	1
some	1
particular	1
ingredient,	1
with	1
which	1
a	1
rigid	1
conformity	1
to	1
the	1
rule	1
was	1
incompatible.	1
Even	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
acquiesce	1
in	1
the	1
necessity,	1
yet	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
regard	1
and	1
to	1
regret	1
a	1
departure	1
from	1
so	1
fundamental	1
a	1
principle,	1
as	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
imperfection	1
in	1
the	1
system	1
which	1
may	1
prove	1
the	1
seed	1
of	1
future	1
weakness,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
anarchy.	1
It	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
alleged,	1
that	1
an	1
election	1
law	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
framed	1
and	1
inserted	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
always	1
applicable	1
to	1
every	1
probable	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
country;	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
therefore	1
not	1
be	1
denied,	1
that	1
a	1
discretionary	1
power	1
over	1
elections	1
ought	1
to	1
exist	1
somewhere.	1
It	1
will,	1
I	1
presume,	1
be	1
as	1
readily	1
conceded,	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
only	1
three	1
ways	1
in	1
which	1
this	1
power	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
reasonably	1
modified	1
and	1
disposed:	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
either	1
have	1
been	1
lodged	1
wholly	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
legislature,	1
or	1
wholly	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
or	1
primarily	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
and	1
ultimately	1
in	1
the	1
former.	1
The	1
last	1
mode	1
has,	1
with	1
reason,	1
been	1
preferred	1
by	1
the	1
convention.	1
They	1
have	1
submitted	1
the	1
regulation	1
of	1
elections	1
for	1
the	1
federal	1
government,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance,	1
to	1
the	1
local	1
administrations;	1
which,	1
in	1
ordinary	1
cases,	1
and	1
when	1
no	1
improper	1
views	1
prevail,	1
may	1
be	1
both	1
more	1
convenient	1
and	1
more	1
satisfactory;	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
reserved	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
authority	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
interpose,	1
whenever	1
extraordinary	1
circumstances	1
might	1
render	1
that	1
interposition	1
necessary	1
to	1
its	1
safety.	1
Nothing	1
can	1
be	1
more	1
evident,	1
than	1
that	1
an	1
exclusive	1
power	1
of	1
regulating	1
elections	1
for	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
would	1
leave	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
entirely	1
at	1
their	1
mercy.	1
They	1
could	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
annihilate	1
it,	1
by	1
neglecting	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
persons	1
to	1
administer	1
its	1
affairs.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
little	1
purpose	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
a	1
neglect	1
or	1
omission	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
take	1
place.	1
The	1
constitutional	1
possibility	1
of	1
the	1
thing,	1
without	1
an	1
equivalent	1
for	1
the	1
risk,	1
is	1
an	1
unanswerable	1
objection.	1
Nor	1
has	1
any	1
satisfactory	1
reason	1
been	1
yet	1
assigned	1
for	1
incurring	1
that	1
risk.	1
The	1
extravagant	1
surmises	1
of	1
a	1
distempered	1
jealousy	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
dignified	1
with	1
that	1
character.	1
If	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
humor	1
to	1
presume	1
abuses	1
of	1
power,	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
fair	1
to	1
presume	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
government.	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
consonant	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
a	1
just	1
theory,	1
to	1
trust	1
the	1
Union	1
with	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
existence,	1
than	1
to	1
transfer	1
that	1
care	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
hands,	1
if	1
abuses	1
of	1
power	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
hazarded	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
side	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
rational	1
to	1
hazard	1
them	1
where	1
the	1
power	1
would	1
naturally	1
be	1
placed,	1
than	1
where	1
it	1
would	1
unnaturally	1
be	1
placed.	1
Suppose	1
an	1
article	1
had	1
been	1
introduced	1
into	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
empowering	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
elections	1
for	1
the	1
particular	1
States,	1
would	1
any	1
man	1
have	1
hesitated	1
to	1
condemn	1
it,	1
both	1
as	1
an	1
unwarrantable	1
transposition	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
premeditated	1
engine	1
for	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments?	1
The	1
violation	1
of	1
principle,	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
would	1
have	1
required	1
no	1
comment;	1
and,	1
to	1
an	1
unbiased	1
observer,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
less	1
apparent	1
in	1
the	1
project	1
of	1
subjecting	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
respect,	1
to	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments.	1
An	1
impartial	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
cannot	1
fail	1
to	1
result	1
in	1
a	1
conviction,	1
that	1
each,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible,	1
ought	1
to	1
depend	1
on	1
itself	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
preservation.	1
As	1
an	1
objection	1
to	1
this	1
position,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
remarked	1
that	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
Senate	1
would	1
involve,	1
in	1
its	1
full	1
extent,	1
the	1
danger	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
suggested	1
might	1
flow	1
from	1
an	1
exclusive	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
federal	1
elections.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
alleged,	1
that	1
by	1
declining	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
Senators,	1
they	1
might	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
give	1
a	1
fatal	1
blow	1
to	1
the	1
Union;	1
and	1
from	1
this	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
inferred,	1
that	1
as	1
its	1
existence	1
would	1
be	1
thus	1
rendered	1
dependent	1
upon	1
them	1
in	1
so	1
essential	1
a	1
point,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
intrusting	1
them	1
with	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
particular	1
case	1
under	1
consideration.	1
The	1
interest	1
of	1
each	1
State,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
added,	1
to	1
maintain	1
its	1
representation	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
councils,	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
complete	1
security	1
against	1
an	1
abuse	1
of	1
the	1
trust.	1
This	1
argument,	1
though	1
specious,	1
will	1
not,	1
upon	1
examination,	1
be	1
found	1
solid.	1
It	1
is	1
certainly	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
by	1
forbearing	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
senators,	1
may	1
destroy	1
the	1
national	1
government.	1
But	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
follow	1
that,	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
in	1
one	1
instance,	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
in	1
every	1
other.	1
There	1
are	1
cases	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
pernicious	1
tendency	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
power	1
may	1
be	1
far	1
more	1
decisive,	1
without	1
any	1
motive	1
equally	1
cogent	1
with	1
that	1
which	1
must	1
have	1
regulated	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
to	1
recommend	1
their	1
admission	1
into	1
the	1
system.	1
So	1
far	1
as	1
that	1
construction	1
may	1
expose	1
the	1
Union	1
to	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
injury	1
from	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
evil;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
evil	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
avoided	1
without	1
excluding	1
the	1
States,	1
in	1
their	1
political	1
capacities,	1
wholly	1
from	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
organization	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government.	1
If	1
this	1
had	1
been	1
done,	1
it	1
would	1
doubtless	1
have	1
been	1
interpreted	1
into	1
an	1
entire	1
dereliction	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
principle;	1
and	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
deprived	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
of	1
that	1
absolute	1
safeguard	1
which	1
they	1
will	1
enjoy	1
under	1
this	1
provision.	1
But	1
however	1
wise	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
have	1
submitted	1
in	1
this	1
instance	1
to	1
an	1
inconvenience,	1
for	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
a	1
necessary	1
advantage	1
or	1
a	1
greater	1
good,	1
no	1
inference	1
can	1
be	1
drawn	1
from	1
thence	1
to	1
favor	1
an	1
accumulation	1
of	1
the	1
evil,	1
where	1
no	1
necessity	1
urges,	1
nor	1
any	1
greater	1
good	1
invites.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
easily	1
discerned	1
also	1
that	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
would	1
run	1
a	1
much	1
greater	1
risk	1
from	1
a	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
over	1
the	1
elections	1
of	1
its	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
than	1
from	1
their	1
power	1
of	1
appointing	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
its	1
Senate.	1
The	1
senators	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
chosen	1
for	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
six	1
years;	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
rotation,	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
seats	1
of	1
a	1
third	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
vacated	1
and	1
replenished	1
every	1
two	1
years;	1
and	1
no	1
State	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
entitled	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
senators;	1
a	1
quorum	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
to	1
consist	1
of	1
sixteen	1
members.	1
The	1
joint	1
result	1
of	1
these	1
circumstances	1
would	1
be,	1
that	1
a	1
temporary	1
combination	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
States	1
to	1
intermit	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
senators,	1
could	1
neither	1
annul	1
the	1
existence	1
nor	1
impair	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
body;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
from	1
a	1
general	1
and	1
permanent	1
combination	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
have	1
any	1
thing	1
to	1
fear.	1
The	1
first	1
might	1
proceed	1
from	1
sinister	1
designs	1
in	1
the	1
leading	1
members	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures;	1
the	1
last	1
would	1
suppose	1
a	1
fixed	1
and	1
rooted	1
disaffection	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
which	1
will	1
either	1
never	1
exist	1
at	1
all,	1
or	1
will,	1
in	1
all	1
probability,	1
proceed	1
from	1
an	1
experience	1
of	1
the	1
inaptitude	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
government	1
to	1
the	1
advancement	1
of	1
their	1
happiness	1
in	1
which	1
event	1
no	1
good	1
citizen	1
could	1
desire	1
its	1
continuance.	1
But	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
there	1
is	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
general	1
election	1
of	1
members	1
once	1
in	1
two	1
years.	1
If	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
invested	1
with	1
an	1
exclusive	1
power	1
of	1
regulating	1
these	1
elections,	1
every	1
period	1
of	1
making	1
them	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
delicate	1
crisis	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
situation,	1
which	1
might	1
issue	1
in	1
a	1
dissolution	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
if	1
the	1
leaders	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
States	1
should	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
a	1
previous	1
conspiracy	1
to	1
prevent	1
an	1
election.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
deny,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
weight	1
in	1
the	1
observation,	1
that	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
each	1
State,	1
to	1
be	1
represented	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
councils,	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
security	1
against	1
the	1
abuse	1
of	1
a	1
power	1
over	1
its	1
elections	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures.	1
But	1
the	1
security	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
complete,	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
an	1
obvious	1
distinction	1
between	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
felicity,	1
and	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
their	1
local	1
rulers	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
consequence	1
of	1
their	1
offices.	1
The	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
may	1
be	1
warmly	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
at	1
times	1
when	1
the	1
particular	1
rulers	1
of	1
particular	1
States,	1
stimulated	1
by	1
the	1
natural	1
rivalship	1
of	1
power,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
hopes	1
of	1
personal	1
aggrandizement,	1
and	1
supported	1
by	1
a	1
strong	1
faction	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
those	1
States,	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
opposite	1
temper.	1
This	1
diversity	1
of	1
sentiment	1
between	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
the	1
individuals	1
who	1
have	1
the	1
greatest	1
credit	1
in	1
their	1
councils,	1
is	1
exemplified	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
moment,	1
on	1
the	1
present	1
question.	1
The	1
scheme	1
of	1
separate	1
confederacies,	1
which	1
will	1
always	1
multiply	1
the	1
chances	1
of	1
ambition,	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
never	1
failing	1
bait	1
to	1
all	1
such	1
influential	1
characters	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
administrations	1
as	1
are	1
capable	1
of	1
preferring	1
their	1
own	1
emolument	1
and	1
advancement	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
weal.	1
With	1
so	1
effectual	1
a	1
weapon	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
as	1
the	1
exclusive	1
power	1
of	1
regulating	1
elections	1
for	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
a	1
combination	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
such	1
men,	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
considerable	1
States,	1
where	1
the	1
temptation	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
the	1
strongest,	1
might	1
accomplish	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
by	1
seizing	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
some	1
casual	1
dissatisfaction	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
(and	1
which	1
perhaps	1
they	1
may	1
themselves	1
have	1
excited),	1
to	1
discontinue	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
members	1
for	1
the	1
federal	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives.	1
It	1
ought	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
forgotten,	1
that	1
a	1
firm	1
union	1
of	1
this	1
country,	1
under	1
an	1
efficient	1
government,	1
will	1
probably	1
be	1
an	1
increasing	1
object	1
of	1
jealousy	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
nation	1
of	1
Europe;	1
and	1
that	1
enterprises	1
to	1
subvert	1
it	1
will	1
sometimes	1
originate	1
in	1
the	1
intrigues	1
of	1
foreign	1
powers,	1
and	1
will	1
seldom	1
fail	1
to	1
be	1
patronized	1
and	1
abetted	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
them.	1
Its	1
preservation,	1
therefore	1
ought	1
in	1
no	1
case	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
avoided,	1
to	1
be	1
committed	1
to	1
the	1
guardianship	1
of	1
any	1
but	1
those	1
whose	1
situation	1
will	1

beget	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
WE	1
HAVE	1
seen,	1
that	1
an	1
uncontrollable	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
elections	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
could	1
not,	1
without	1
hazard,	1
be	1
committed	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures.	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
see,	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
danger	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side;	1
that	1
is,	1
from	1
confiding	1
the	1
ultimate	1
right	1
of	1
regulating	1
its	1
own	1
elections	1
to	1
the	1
Union	1
itself.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
pretended,	1
that	1
this	1
right	1
would	1
ever	1
be	1
used	1
for	1
the	1
exclusion	1
of	1
any	1
State	1
from	1
its	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
representation.	1
The	1
interest	1
of	1
all	1
would,	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
at	1
least,	1
be	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
all.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
alleged,	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
employed	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
promote	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
some	1
favorite	1
class	1
of	1
men	1
in	1
exclusion	1
of	1
others,	1
by	1
confining	1
the	1
places	1
of	1
election	1
to	1
particular	1
districts,	1
and	1
rendering	1
it	1
impracticable	1
to	1
the	1
citizens	1
at	1
large	1
to	1
partake	1
in	1
the	1
choice.	1
Of	1
all	1
chimerical	1
suppositions,	1
this	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
chimerical.	1
On	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
no	1
rational	1
calculation	1
of	1
probabilities	1
would	1
lead	1
us	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
the	1
disposition	1
which	1
a	1
conduct	1
so	1
violent	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
would	1
imply,	1
could	1
ever	1
find	1
its	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
national	1
councils;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
concluded	1
with	1
certainty,	1
that	1
if	1
so	1
improper	1
a	1
spirit	1
should	1
ever	1
gain	1
admittance	1
into	1
them,	1
it	1
would	1
display	1
itself	1
in	1
a	1
form	1
altogether	1
different	1
and	1
far	1
more	1
decisive.	1
The	1
improbability	1
of	1
the	1
attempt	1
may	1
be	1
satisfactorily	1
inferred	1
from	1
this	1
single	1
reflection,	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
made	1
without	1
causing	1
an	1
immediate	1
revolt	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
headed	1
and	1
directed	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
governments.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
difficult	1
to	1
conceive	1
that	1
this	1
characteristic	1
right	1
of	1
freedom	1
may,	1
in	1
certain	1
turbulent	1
and	1
factious	1
seasons,	1
be	1
violated,	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
a	1
particular	1
class	1
of	1
citizens,	1
by	1
a	1
victorious	1
and	1
overbearing	1
majority;	1
but	1
that	1
so	1
fundamental	1
a	1
privilege,	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
so	1
situated	1
and	1
enlightened,	1
should	1
be	1
invaded	1
to	1
the	1
prejudice	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
by	1
the	1
deliberate	1
policy	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
without	1
occasioning	1
a	1
popular	1
revolution,	1
is	1
altogether	1
inconceivable	1
and	1
incredible.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
this	1
general	1
reflection,	1
there	1
are	1
considerations	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
precise	1
nature,	1
which	1
forbid	1
all	1
apprehension	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
The	1
dissimilarity	1
in	1
the	1
ingredients	1
which	1
will	1
compose	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
action	1
in	1
its	1
various	1
branches,	1
must	1
form	1
a	1
powerful	1
obstacle	1
to	1
a	1
concert	1
of	1
views	1
in	1
any	1
partial	1
scheme	1
of	1
elections.	1
There	1
is	1
sufficient	1
diversity	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
property,	1
in	1
the	1
genius,	1
manners,	1
and	1
habits	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
to	1
occasion	1
a	1
material	1
diversity	1
of	1
disposition	1
in	1
their	1
representatives	1
towards	1
the	1
different	1
ranks	1
and	1
conditions	1
in	1
society.	1
And	1
though	1
an	1
intimate	1
intercourse	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
government	1
will	1
promote	1
a	1
gradual	1
assimilation	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
respects,	1
yet	1
there	1
are	1
causes,	1
as	1
well	1
physical	1
as	1
moral,	1
which	1
may,	1
in	1
a	1
greater	1
or	1
less	1
degree,	1
permanently	1
nourish	1
different	1
propensities	1
and	1
inclinations	1
in	1
this	1
respect.	1
But	1
the	1
circumstance	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
greatest	1
influence	1
in	1
the	1
matter,	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
dissimilar	1
modes	1
of	1
constituting	1
the	1
several	1
component	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
The	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
being	1
to	1
be	1
elected	1
immediately	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
Senate	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
the	1
President	1
by	1
electors	1
chosen	1
for	1
that	1
purpose	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
little	1
probability	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
interest	1
to	1
cement	1
these	1
different	1
branches	1
in	1
a	1
predilection	1
for	1
any	1
particular	1
class	1
of	1
electors.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
Senate,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
any	1
regulation	1
of	1
"time	1
and	1
manner,"	1
which	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
proposed	1
to	1
be	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
that	1
body,	1
can	1
affect	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
will	1
direct	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
its	1
members.	1
The	1
collective	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
influenced	1
by	1
extraneous	1
circumstances	1
of	1
that	1
sort;	1
a	1
consideration	1
which	1
alone	1
ought	1
to	1
satisfy	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
discrimination	1
apprehended	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
attempted.	1
For	1
what	1
inducement	1
could	1
the	1
Senate	1
have	1
to	1
concur	1
in	1
a	1
preference	1
in	1
which	1
itself	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
included?	1
Or	1
to	1
what	1
purpose	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
established,	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
one	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
if	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
extended	1
to	1
the	1
other?	1
The	1
composition	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
would	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
counteract	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
And	1
we	1
can	1
never	1
suppose	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
embrace	1
the	1
appointments	1
to	1
the	1
Senate,	1
unless	1
we	1
can	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
suppose	1
the	1
voluntary	1
co-operation	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures.	1
If	1
we	1
make	1
the	1
latter	1
supposition,	1
it	1
then	1
becomes	1
immaterial	1
where	1
the	1
power	1
in	1
question	1
is	1
placed	1
whether	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
or	1
in	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
this	1
capricious	1
partiality	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
councils?	1
Is	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
exercised	1
in	1
a	1
discrimination	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
departments	1
of	1
industry,	1
or	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
kinds	1
of	1
property,	1
or	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
degrees	1
of	1
property?	1
Will	1
it	1
lean	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
landed	1
interest,	1
or	1
the	1
moneyed	1
interest,	1
or	1
the	1
mercantile	1
interest,	1
or	1
the	1
manufacturing	1
interest?	1
Or,	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
fashionable	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
adversaries	1
to	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
will	1
it	1
court	1
the	1
elevation	1
of	1
"the	1
wealthy	1
and	1
the	1
well-born,"	1
to	1
the	1
exclusion	1
and	1
debasement	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
society?	1
If	1
this	1
partiality	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
exerted	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
concerned	1
in	1
any	1
particular	1
description	1
of	1
industry	1
or	1
property,	1
I	1
presume	1
it	1
will	1
readily	1
be	1
admitted,	1
that	1
the	1
competition	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
lie	1
between	1
landed	1
men	1
and	1
merchants.	1
And	1
I	1
scruple	1
not	1
to	1
affirm,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
infinitely	1
less	1
likely	1
that	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
gain	1
an	1
ascendant	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
councils,	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
predominate	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
local	1
councils.	1
The	1
inference	1
will	1
be,	1
that	1
a	1
conduct	1
tending	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
undue	1
preference	1
to	1
either	1
is	1
much	1
less	1
to	1
be	1
dreaded	1
from	1
the	1
former	1
than	1
from	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
several	1
States	1
are	1
in	1
various	1
degrees	1
addicted	1
to	1
agriculture	1
and	1
commerce.	1
In	1
most,	1
if	1
not	1
all	1
of	1
them,	1
agriculture	1
is	1
predominant.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
them,	1
however,	1
commerce	1
nearly	1
divides	1
its	1
empire,	1
and	1
in	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
has	1
a	1
considerable	1
share	1
of	1
influence.	1
In	1
proportion	1
as	1
either	1
prevails,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
conveyed	1
into	1
the	1
national	1
representation;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
very	1
reason,	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
an	1
emanation	1
from	1
a	1
greater	1
variety	1
of	1
interests,	1
and	1
in	1
much	1
more	1
various	1
proportions,	1
than	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
any	1
single	1
State,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
less	1
apt	1
to	1
espouse	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
decided	1
partiality,	1
than	1
the	1
representation	1
of	1
any	1
single	1
State.	1
In	1
a	1
country	1
consisting	1
chiefly	1
of	1
the	1
cultivators	1
of	1
land,	1
where	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
an	1
equal	1
representation	1
obtain,	1
the	1
landed	1
interest	1
must,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
preponderate	1
in	1
the	1
government.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
this	1
interest	1
prevails	1
in	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
so	1
long	1
it	1
must	1
maintain	1
a	1
correspondent	1
superiority	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
Senate,	1
which	1
will	1
generally	1
be	1
a	1
faithful	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
majorities	1
of	1
those	1
assemblies.	1
It	1
cannot	1
therefore	1
be	1
presumed,	1
that	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
landed	1
to	1
the	1
mercantile	1
class	1
will	1
ever	1
be	1
a	1
favorite	1
object	1
of	1
this	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
legislature.	1
In	1
applying	1
thus	1
particularly	1
to	1
the	1
Senate	1
a	1
general	1
observation	1
suggested	1
by	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
I	1
am	1
governed	1
by	1
the	1
consideration,	1
that	1
the	1
credulous	1
votaries	1
of	1
State	1
power	1
cannot,	1
upon	1
their	1
own	1
principles,	1
suspect,	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
would	1
be	1
warped	1
from	1
their	1
duty	1
by	1
any	1
external	1
influence.	1
But	1
in	1
reality	1
the	1
same	1
situation	1
must	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
effect,	1
in	1
the	1
primative	1
composition	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives:	1
an	1
improper	1
bias	1
towards	1
the	1
mercantile	1
class	1
is	1
as	1
little	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
from	1
this	1
quarter	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
other.	1
In	1
order,	1
perhaps,	1
to	1
give	1
countenance	1
to	1
the	1
objection	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
asked,	1
is	1
there	1
not	1
danger	1
of	1
an	1
opposite	1
bias	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
which	1
may	1
dispose	1
it	1
to	1
endeavor	1
to	1
secure	1
a	1
monopoly	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
administration	1
to	1
the	1
landed	1
class?	1
As	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
likelihood	1
that	1
the	1
supposition	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
bias	1
will	1
have	1
any	1
terrors	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
immediately	1
injured	1
by	1
it,	1
a	1
labored	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
question	1
will	1
be	1
dispensed	1
with.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
remark,	1
first,	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
reasons	1
elsewhere	1
assigned,	1
it	1
is	1
less	1
likely	1
that	1
any	1
decided	1
partiality	1
should	1
prevail	1
in	1
the	1
councils	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
than	1
in	1
those	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
its	1
members.	1
Secondly,	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
temptation	1
to	1
violate	1
the	1
Constitution	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
landed	1
class,	1
because	1
that	1
class	1
would,	1
in	1
the	1
natural	1
course	1
of	1
things,	1
enjoy	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
preponderancy	1
as	1
itself	1
could	1
desire.	1
And	1
thirdly,	1
that	1
men	1
accustomed	1
to	1
investigate	1
the	1
sources	1
of	1
public	1
prosperity	1
upon	1
a	1
large	1
scale,	1
must	1
be	1
too	1
well	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
utility	1
of	1
commerce,	1
to	1
be	1
inclined	1
to	1
inflict	1
upon	1
it	1
so	1
deep	1
a	1
wound	1
as	1
would	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
entire	1
exclusion	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
best	1
understand	1
its	1
interest	1
from	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
importance	1
of	1
commerce,	1
in	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
revenue	1
alone,	1
must	1
effectually	1
guard	1
it	1
against	1
the	1
enmity	1
of	1
a	1
body	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
continually	1
importuned	1
in	1
its	1
favor,	1
by	1
the	1
urgent	1
calls	1
of	1
public	1
necessity.	1
I	1
the	1
rather	1
consult	1
brevity	1
in	1
discussing	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
a	1
preference	1
founded	1
upon	1
a	1
discrimination	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
kinds	1
of	1
industry	1
and	1
property,	1
because,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
understand	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
objectors,	1
they	1
contemplate	1
a	1
discrimination	1
of	1
another	1
kind.	1
They	1
appear	1
to	1
have	1
in	1
view,	1
as	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
the	1
preference	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
endeavor	1
to	1
alarm	1
us,	1
those	1
whom	1
they	1
designate	1
by	1
the	1
description	1
of	1
"the	1
wealthy	1
and	1
the	1
well-born."	1
These,	1
it	1
seems,	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
exalted	1
to	1
an	1
odious	1
pre-eminence	1
over	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
their	1
fellow-citizens.	1
At	1
one	1
time,	1
however,	1
their	1
elevation	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
necessary	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
smallness	1
of	1
the	1
representative	1
body;	1
at	1
another	1
time	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
effected	1
by	1
depriving	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large	1
of	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
exercising	1
their	1
right	1
of	1
suffrage	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
that	1
body.	1
But	1
upon	1
what	1
principle	1
is	1
the	1
discrimination	1
of	1
the	1
places	1
of	1
election	1
to	1
be	1
made,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
meditated	1
preference?	1
Are	1
"the	1
wealthy	1
and	1
the	1
well-born,"	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
called,	1
confined	1
to	1
particular	1
spots	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
States?	1
Have	1
they,	1
by	1
some	1
miraculous	1
instinct	1
or	1
foresight,	1
set	1
apart	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
common	1
place	1
of	1
residence?	1
Are	1
they	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
the	1
towns	1
or	1
cities?	1
Or	1
are	1
they,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
scattered	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
avarice	1
or	1
chance	1
may	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
cast	1
their	1
own	1
lot	1
or	1
that	1
of	1
their	1
predecessors?	1
If	1
the	1
latter	1
is	1
the	1
case,	1
(as	1
every	1
intelligent	1
man	1
knows	1
it	1
to	1
be,1)	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
policy	1
of	1
confining	1
the	1
places	1
of	1
election	1
to	1
particular	1
districts	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
subversive	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
aim	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
exceptionable	1
on	1
every	1
other	1
account?	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
method	1
of	1
securing	1
to	1
the	1
rich	1
the	1
preference	1
apprehended,	1
but	1
by	1
prescribing	1
qualifications	1
of	1
property	1
either	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
may	1
elect	1
or	1
be	1
elected.	1
But	1
this	1
forms	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
be	1
conferred	1
upon	1
the	1
national	1
government.	1
Its	1
authority	1
would	1
be	1
expressly	1
restricted	1
to	1
the	1
regulation	1
of	1
the	1
TIMES,	1
the	1
PLACES,	1
the	1
MANNER	1
of	1
elections.	1
The	1
qualifications	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
may	1
choose	1
or	1
be	1
chosen,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
remarked	1
upon	1
other	1
occasions,	1
are	1
defined	1
and	1
fixed	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
and	1
are	1
unalterable	1
by	1
the	1
legislature.	1
Let	1
it,	1
however,	1
be	1
admitted,	1
for	1
argument	1
sake,	1
that	1
the	1
expedient	1
suggested	1
might	1
be	1
successful;	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
be	1
equally	1
taken	1
for	1
granted	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
scruples	1
which	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
duty	1
or	1
an	1
apprehension	1
of	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
the	1
experiment	1
might	1
inspire,	1
were	1
overcome	1
in	1
the	1
breasts	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
rulers,	1
still	1
I	1
imagine	1
it	1
will	1
hardly	1
be	1
pretended	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
ever	1
hope	1
to	1
carry	1
such	1
an	1
enterprise	1
into	1
execution	1
without	1

a	1

sufficient	1
to	1
subdue	1
the	1
resistance	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
The	1
improbability	1
of	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
a	1
force	1
equal	1
to	1
that	1
object	1
has	1
been	1
discussed	1
and	1
demonstrated	1
in	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
these	1
papers;	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
futility	1
of	1
the	1
objection	1
under	1
consideration	1
may	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
strongest	1
light,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
conceded	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
force	1
might	1
exist,	1
and	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
shall	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
actual	1
possession	1
of	1
it.	1
What	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
conclusion?	1
With	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
invade	1
the	1
essential	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
community,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
gratifying	1
that	1
disposition,	1
is	1
it	1
presumable	1
that	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
were	1
actuated	1
by	1
it	1
would	1
amuse	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
ridiculous	1
task	1
of	1
fabricating	1
election	1
laws	1
for	1
securing	1
a	1
preference	1
to	1
a	1
favorite	1
class	1
of	1
men?	1
Would	1
they	1
not	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
prefer	1
a	1
conduct	1
better	1
adapted	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
immediate	1
aggrandizement?	1
Would	1
they	1
not	1
rather	1
boldly	1
resolve	1
to	1
perpetuate	1
themselves	1
in	1
office	1
by	1
one	1
decisive	1
act	1
of	1
usurpation,	1
than	1
to	1
trust	1
to	1
precarious	1
expedients	1
which,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
precautions	1
that	1
might	1
accompany	1
them,	1
might	1
terminate	1
in	1
the	1
dismission,	1
disgrace,	1
and	1
ruin	1
of	1
their	1
authors?	1
Would	1
they	1
not	1
fear	1
that	1
citizens,	1
not	1
less	1
tenacious	1
than	1
conscious	1
of	1
their	1
rights,	1
would	1
flock	1
from	1
the	1

their	1

the	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
more	1
candid	1
opposers	1
of	1
the	1
provision	1
respecting	1
elections,	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
when	1
pressed	1
in	1
argument,	1
will	1
sometimes	1
concede	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
that	1
provision;	1
with	1
this	1
qualification,	1
however,	1
that	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
accompanied	1
with	1
a	1
declaration,	1
that	1
all	1
elections	1
should	1
be	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
counties	1
where	1
the	1
electors	1
resided.	1
This,	1
say	1
they,	1
was	1
a	1
necessary	1
precaution	1
against	1
an	1
abuse	1
of	1
the	1
power.	1
A	1
declaration	1
of	1
this	1
nature	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
been	1
harmless;	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
quieting	1
apprehensions,	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
undesirable.	1
But	1
it	1
would,	1
in	1
fact,	1
have	1
afforded	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
additional	1
security	1
against	1
the	1
danger	1
apprehended;	1
and	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
it	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
considered,	1
by	1
an	1
impartial	1
and	1
judicious	1
examiner,	1
as	1
a	1
serious,	1
still	1
less	1
as	1
an	1
insuperable,	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
plan.	1
The	1
different	1
views	1
taken	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
preceding	1
papers	1
must	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
satisfy	1
all	1
dispassionate	1
and	1
discerning	1
men,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
public	1
liberty	1
should	1
ever	1
be	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
the	1
ambition	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
rulers,	1
the	1
power	1
under	1
examination,	1
at	1
least,	1
will	1
be	1
guiltless	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice.	1
If	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
inclined	1
to	1
consult	1
their	1
jealousy	1
only,	1
would	1
exercise	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
careful	1
inspection	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
they	1
would	1
find	1
little	1
less	1
room	1
for	1
disquietude	1
and	1
alarm,	1
from	1
the	1
latitude	1
which	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
allow	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
elections,	1
than	1
from	1
the	1
latitude	1
which	1
is	1
proposed	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
respect.	1
A	1
review	1
of	1
their	1
situation,	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
would	1
tend	1
greatly	1
to	1
remove	1
any	1
ill	1
impressions	1
which	1
may	1
remain	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
matter.	1
But	1
as	1
that	1
view	1
would	1
lead	1
into	1
long	1
and	1
tedious	1
details,	1
I	1
shall	1
content	1
myself	1
with	1
the	1
single	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
write.	1
The	1
constitution	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
makes	1
no	1
other	1
provision	1
for	1
LOCALITY	1
of	1
elections,	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Assembly	1
shall	1
be	1
elected	1
in	1
the	1
COUNTIES;	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
districts	1
into	1
which	1
the	1
State	1
is	1
or	1
may	1
be	1
divided:	1
these	1
at	1
present	1
are	1
four	1
in	1
number,	1
and	1
comprehend	1
each	1
from	1
two	1
to	1
six	1
counties.	1
It	1
may	1
readily	1
be	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
more	1
difficult	1
to	1
the	1
legislature	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
to	1
defeat	1
the	1
suffrages	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
by	1
confining	1
elections	1
to	1
particular	1
places,	1
than	1
for	1
the	1
legislature	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
to	1
defeat	1
the	1
suffrages	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
by	1
the	1
like	1
expedient.	1
Suppose,	1
for	1
instance,	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Albany	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
appointed	1
the	1
sole	1
place	1
of	1
election	1
for	1
the	1
county	1
and	1
district	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
part,	1
would	1
not	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
that	1
city	1
speedily	1
become	1
the	1
only	1
electors	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
and	1
Assembly	1
for	1
that	1
county	1
and	1
district?	1
Can	1
we	1
imagine	1
that	1
the	1
electors	1
who	1
reside	1
in	1
the	1
remote	1
subdivisions	1
of	1
the	1
counties	1
of	1
Albany,	1
Saratoga,	1
Cambridge,	1
etc.,	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
county	1
of	1
Montgomery,	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Albany,	1
to	1
give	1
their	1
votes	1
for	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Assembly	1
or	1
Senate,	1
sooner	1
than	1
they	1
would	1
repair	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
to	1
participate	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives?	1
The	1
alarming	1
indifference	1
discoverable	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
so	1
invaluable	1
a	1
privilege	1
under	1
the	1
existing	1
laws,	1
which	1
afford	1
every	1
facility	1
to	1
it,	1
furnishes	1
a	1
ready	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
question.	1
And,	1
abstracted	1
from	1
any	1
experience	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
we	1
can	1
be	1
at	1
no	1
loss	1
to	1
determine,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
election	1
is	1
at	1
an	1
INCONVENIENT	1
DISTANCE	1
from	1
the	1
elector,	1
the	1
effect	1
upon	1
his	1
conduct	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
whether	1
that	1
distance	1
be	1
twenty	1
miles	1
or	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
miles.	1
Hence	1
it	1
must	1
appear,	1
that	1
objections	1
to	1
the	1
particular	1
modification	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
power	1
of	1
regulating	1
elections	1
will,	1
in	1
substance,	1
apply	1
with	1
equal	1
force	1
to	1
the	1
modification	1
of	1
the	1
like	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
this	1
State;	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
reason	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
acquit	1
the	1
one,	1
and	1
to	1
condemn	1
the	1
other.	1
A	1
similar	1
comparison	1
would	1
lead	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
conclusion	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
constitutions	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
States.	1
If	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
defects	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
furnish	1
no	1
apology	1
for	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
proposed,	1
I	1
answer,	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
former	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
thought	1
chargeable	1
with	1
inattention	1
to	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
liberty,	1
where	1
the	1
imputations	1
thrown	1
on	1
the	1
latter	1
can	1
be	1
shown	1
to	1
be	1
applicable	1
to	1
them	1
also,	1
the	1
presumption	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
rather	1
the	1
cavilling	1
refinements	1
of	1
a	1
predetermined	1
opposition,	1
than	1
the	1
well-founded	1
inferences	1
of	1
a	1
candid	1
research	1
after	1
truth.	1
To	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
disposed	1
to	1
consider,	1
as	1
innocent	1
omissions	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
what	1
they	1
regard	1
as	1
unpardonable	1
blemishes	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
said;	1
or	1
at	1
most,	1
they	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
asked	1
to	1
assign	1
some	1
substantial	1
reason	1
why	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
State	1
should	1
be	1
more	1
impregnable	1
to	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
power,	1
or	1
other	1
sinister	1
motives,	1
than	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States?	1
If	1
they	1
cannot	1
do	1
this,	1
they	1
ought	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
prove	1
to	1
us	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
to	1
subvert	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
three	1
millions	1
of	1
people,	1
with	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
local	1
governments	1
to	1
head	1
their	1
opposition,	1
than	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
destitute	1
of	1
that	1
advantage.	1
And	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
immediately	1
under	1
consideration,	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
convince	1
us	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
less	1
probable	1
that	1
a	1
predominant	1
faction	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
State	1
should,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
maintain	1
its	1
superiority,	1
incline	1
to	1
a	1
preference	1
of	1
a	1
particular	1
class	1
of	1
electors,	1
than	1
that	1
a	1
similar	1
spirit	1
should	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
thirteen	1
States,	1
spread	1
over	1
a	1
vast	1
region,	1
and	1
in	1
several	1
respects	1
distinguishable	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
by	1
a	1
diversity	1
of	1
local	1
circumstances,	1
prejudices,	1
and	1
interests.	1
Hitherto	1
my	1
observations	1
have	1
only	1
aimed	1
at	1
a	1
vindication	1
of	1
the	1
provision	1
in	1
question,	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
theoretic	1
propriety,	1
on	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
placing	1
the	1
power	1
elsewhere,	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
placing	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
proposed.	1
But	1
there	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
mentioned	1
a	1
positive	1
advantage	1
which	1
will	1
result	1
from	1
this	1
disposition,	1
and	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
as	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
obtained	1
from	1
any	1
other:	1
I	1
allude	1
to	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
uniformity	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
elections	1
for	1
the	1
federal	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives.	1
It	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
possible	1
that	1
this	1
uniformity	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
by	1
experience	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
welfare,	1
both	1
as	1
a	1
security	1
against	1
the	1
perpetuation	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
cure	1
for	1
the	1
diseases	1
of	1
faction.	1
If	1
each	1
State	1
may	1
choose	1
its	1
own	1
time	1
of	1
election,	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
many	1
different	1
periods	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
months	1
in	1
the	1
year.	1
The	1
times	1
of	1
election	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
now	1
established	1
for	1
local	1
purposes,	1
vary	1
between	1
extremes	1
as	1
wide	1
as	1
March	1
and	1
November.	1
The	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
diversity	1
would	1
be	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
never	1
happen	1
a	1
total	1
dissolution	1
or	1
renovation	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
at	1
one	1
time.	1
If	1
an	1
improper	1
spirit	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
prevail	1
in	1
it,	1
that	1
spirit	1
would	1
be	1
apt	1
to	1
infuse	1
itself	1
into	1
the	1
new	1
members,	1
as	1
they	1
come	1
forward	1
in	1
succession.	1
The	1
mass	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
remain	1
nearly	1
the	1
same,	1
assimilating	1
constantly	1
to	1
itself	1
its	1
gradual	1
accretions.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
contagion	1
in	1
example	1
which	1
few	1
men	1
have	1
sufficient	1
force	1
of	1
mind	1
to	1
resist.	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
treble	1
the	1
duration	1
in	1
office,	1
with	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
a	1
total	1
dissolution	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
might	1
be	1
less	1
formidable	1
to	1
liberty	1
than	1
one	1
third	1
of	1
that	1
duration	1
subject	1
to	1
gradual	1
and	1
successive	1
alterations.	1
Uniformity	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
elections	1
seems	1
not	1
less	1
requisite	1
for	1
executing	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
regular	1
rotation	1
in	1
the	1
Senate,	1
and	1
for	1
conveniently	1
assembling	1
the	1
legislature	1
at	1
a	1
stated	1
period	1
in	1
each	1
year.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
asked,	1
Why,	1
then,	1
could	1
not	1
a	1
time	1
have	1
been	1
fixed	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution?	1
As	1
the	1
most	1
zealous	1
adversaries	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
in	1
this	1
State	1
are,	1
in	1
general,	1
not	1
less	1
zealous	1
admirers	1
of	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
State,	1
the	1
question	1
may	1
be	1
retorted,	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
asked,	1
Why	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
like	1
purpose	1
fixed	1
in	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
this	1
State?	1
No	1
better	1
answer	1
can	1
be	1
given	1
than	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
which	1
might	1
safely	1
be	1
entrusted	1
to	1
legislative	1
discretion;	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
a	1
time	1
had	1
been	1
appointed,	1
it	1
might,	1
upon	1
experiment,	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
less	1
convenient	1
than	1
some	1
other	1
time.	1
The	1
same	1
answer	1
may	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side.	1
And	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
added	1
that	1
the	1
supposed	1
danger	1
of	1
a	1
gradual	1
change	1
being	1
merely	1
speculative,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
hardly	1
advisable	1
upon	1
that	1
speculation	1
to	1
establish,	1
as	1
a	1
fundamental	1
point,	1
what	1
would	1
deprive	1
several	1
States	1
of	1
the	1
convenience	1
of	1
having	1
the	1
elections	1
for	1
their	1
own	1
governments	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
epochs.	1

HAMILTON	1
OR	1
MADISON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
HAVING	1
examined	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
and	1
answered	1
such	1
of	1
the	1
objections	1
against	1
it	1
as	1
seemed	1
to	1
merit	1
notice,	1
I	1
enter	1
next	1
on	1
the	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
Senate.	1
The	1
heads	1
into	1
which	1
this	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
are:	1
I.	1
The	1
qualification	1
of	1
senators;	1
II.	1
The	1
appointment	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures;	1
III.	1
The	1
equality	1
of	1
representation	1
in	1
the	1
Senate;	1
IV.	1
The	1
number	1
of	1
senators,	1
and	1
the	1
term	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
elected;	1
V.	1
The	1
powers	1
vested	1
in	1
the	1
Senate.	1
I.	1
The	1
qualifications	1
proposed	1
for	1
senators,	1
as	1
distinguished	1
from	1
those	1
of	1
representatives,	1
consist	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
advanced	1
age	1
and	1
a	1
longer	1
period	1
of	1
citizenship.	1
A	1
senator	1
must	1
be	1
thirty	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
at	1
least;	1
as	1
a	1
representative	1
must	1
be	1
twenty-five.	1
And	1
the	1
former	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
citizen	1
nine	1
years;	1
as	1
seven	1
years	1
are	1
required	1
for	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
propriety	1
of	1
these	1
distinctions	1
is	1
explained	1
by	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
senatorial	1
trust,	1
which,	1
requiring	1
greater	1
extent	1
of	1
information	1
and	1
stability	1
of	1
character,	1
requires	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
senator	1
should	1
have	1
reached	1
a	1
period	1
of	1
life	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
supply	1
these	1
advantages;	1
and	1
which,	1
participating	1
immediately	1
in	1
transactions	1
with	1
foreign	1
nations,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
exercised	1
by	1
none	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
thoroughly	1
weaned	1
from	1
the	1
prepossessions	1
and	1
habits	1
incident	1
to	1
foreign	1
birth	1
and	1
education.	1
The	1
term	1
of	1
nine	1
years	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
prudent	1
mediocrity	1
between	1
a	1
total	1
exclusion	1
of	1
adopted	1
citizens,	1
whose	1
merits	1
and	1
talents	1
may	1
claim	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
confidence,	1
and	1
an	1
indiscriminate	1
and	1
hasty	1
admission	1
of	1
them,	1
which	1
might	1
create	1
a	1
channel	1
for	1
foreign	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
national	1
councils.	1
II.	1
It	1
is	1
equally	1
unnecessary	1
to	1
dilate	1
on	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
senators	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures.	1
Among	1
the	1
various	1
modes	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
devised	1
for	1
constituting	1
this	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
that	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
proposed	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
is	1
probably	1
the	1
most	1
congenial	1
with	1
the	1
public	1
opinion.	1
It	1
is	1
recommended	1
by	1
the	1
double	1
advantage	1
of	1
favoring	1
a	1
select	1
appointment,	1
and	1
of	1
giving	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
such	1
an	1
agency	1
in	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
as	1
must	1
secure	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
former,	1
and	1
may	1
form	1
a	1
convenient	1
link	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
systems.	1
III.	1
The	1
equality	1
of	1
representation	1
in	1
the	1
Senate	1
is	1
another	1
point,	1
which,	1
being	1
evidently	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
compromise	1
between	1
the	1
opposite	1
pretensions	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
and	1
the	1
small	1
States,	1
does	1
not	1
call	1
for	1
much	1
discussion.	1
If	1
indeed	1
it	1
be	1
right,	1
that	1
among	1
a	1
people	1
thoroughly	1
incorporated	1
into	1
one	1
nation,	1
every	1
district	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
PROPORTIONAL	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
that	1
among	1
independent	1
and	1
sovereign	1
States,	1
bound	1
together	1
by	1
a	1
simple	1
league,	1
the	1
parties,	1
however	1
unequal	1
in	1
size,	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
EQUAL	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
councils,	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
without	1
some	1
reason	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
compound	1
republic,	1
partaking	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
and	1
federal	1
character,	1
the	1
government	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
founded	1
on	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
proportional	1
and	1
equal	1
representation.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
superfluous	1
to	1
try,	1
by	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
theory,	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
which	1
is	1
allowed	1
on	1
all	1
hands	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
result,	1
not	1
of	1
theory,	1
but	1
"of	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
amity,	1
and	1
that	1
mutual	1
deference	1
and	1
concession	1
which	1
the	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
our	1
political	1
situation	1
rendered	1
indispensable."	1
A	1
common	1
government,	1
with	1
powers	1
equal	1
to	1
its	1
objects,	1
is	1
called	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
voice,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
loudly	1
by	1
the	1
political	1
situation,	1
of	1
America.	1
A	1
government	1
founded	1
on	1
principles	1
more	1
consonant	1
to	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
the	1
larger	1
States,	1
is	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
obtained	1
from	1
the	1
smaller	1
States.	1
The	1
only	1
option,	1
then,	1
for	1
the	1
former,	1
lies	1
between	1
the	1
proposed	1
government	1
and	1
a	1
government	1
still	1
more	1
objectionable.	1
Under	1
this	1
alternative,	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
prudence	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
embrace	1
the	1
lesser	1
evil;	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
indulging	1
a	1
fruitless	1
anticipation	1
of	1
the	1
possible	1
mischiefs	1
which	1
may	1
ensue,	1
to	1
contemplate	1
rather	1
the	1
advantageous	1
consequences	1
which	1
may	1
qualify	1
the	1
sacrifice.	1
In	1
this	1
spirit	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
remarked,	1
that	1
the	1
equal	1
vote	1
allowed	1
to	1
each	1
State	1
is	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
constitutional	1
recognition	1
of	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
sovereignty	1
remaining	1
in	1
the	1
individual	1
States,	1
and	1
an	1
instrument	1
for	1
preserving	1
that	1
residuary	1
sovereignty.	1
So	1
far	1
the	1
equality	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
less	1
acceptable	1
to	1
the	1
large	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
small	1
States;	1
since	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
less	1
solicitous	1
to	1
guard,	1
by	1
every	1
possible	1
expedient,	1
against	1
an	1
improper	1
consolidation	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
into	1
one	1
simple	1
republic.	1
Another	1
advantage	1
accruing	1
from	1
this	1
ingredient	1
in	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
is,	1
the	1
additional	1
impediment	1
it	1
must	1
prove	1
against	1
improper	1
acts	1
of	1
legislation.	1
No	1
law	1
or	1
resolution	1
can	1
now	1
be	1
passed	1
without	1
the	1
concurrence,	1
first,	1
of	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
then,	1
of	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
acknowledged	1
that	1
this	1
complicated	1
check	1
on	1
legislation	1
may	1
in	1
some	1
instances	1
be	1
injurious	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
beneficial;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
peculiar	1
defense	1
which	1
it	1
involves	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
smaller	1
States,	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
rational,	1
if	1
any	1
interests	1
common	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
distinct	1
from	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
States,	1
would	1
otherwise	1
be	1
exposed	1
to	1
peculiar	1
danger.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
larger	1
States	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
able,	1
by	1
their	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
supplies,	1
to	1
defeat	1
unreasonable	1
exertions	1
of	1
this	1
prerogative	1
of	1
the	1
lesser	1
States,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
faculty	1
and	1
excess	1
of	1
law-making	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
diseases	1
to	1
which	1
our	1
governments	1
are	1
most	1
liable,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
impossible	1
that	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
convenient	1
in	1
practice	1
than	1
it	1
appears	1
to	1
many	1
in	1
contemplation.	1
IV.	1
The	1
number	1
of	1
senators,	1
and	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
their	1
appointment,	1
come	1
next	1
to	1
be	1
considered.	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
form	1
an	1
accurate	1
judgment	1
on	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
points,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
proper	1
to	1
inquire	1
into	1
the	1
purposes	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
answered	1
by	1
a	1
senate;	1
and	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
ascertain	1
these,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
review	1
the	1
inconveniences	1
which	1
a	1
republic	1
must	1
suffer	1
from	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
institution.	1
First.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
misfortune	1
incident	1
to	1
republican	1
government,	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
less	1
degree	1
than	1
to	1
other	1
governments,	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
administer	1
it	1
may	1
forget	1
their	1
obligations	1
to	1
their	1
constituents,	1
and	1
prove	1
unfaithful	1
to	1
their	1
important	1
trust.	1
In	1
this	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
a	1
senate,	1
as	1
a	1
second	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
assembly,	1
distinct	1
from,	1
and	1
dividing	1
the	1
power	1
with,	1
a	1
first,	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
a	1
salutary	1
check	1
on	1
the	1
government.	1
It	1
doubles	1
the	1
security	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
by	1
requiring	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
two	1
distinct	1
bodies	1
in	1
schemes	1
of	1
usurpation	1
or	1
perfidy,	1
where	1
the	1
ambition	1
or	1
corruption	1
of	1
one	1
would	1
otherwise	1
be	1
sufficient.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
precaution	1
founded	1
on	1
such	1
clear	1
principles,	1
and	1
now	1
so	1
well	1
understood	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
superfluous	1
to	1
enlarge	1
on	1
it.	1
I	1
will	1
barely	1
remark,	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
improbability	1
of	1
sinister	1
combinations	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
dissimilarity	1
in	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
bodies,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
politic	1
to	1
distinguish	1
them	1
from	1
each	1
other	1
by	1
every	1
circumstance	1
which	1
will	1
consist	1
with	1
a	1
due	1
harmony	1
in	1
all	1
proper	1
measures,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
genuine	1
principles	1
of	1
republican	1
government.	1
Secondly.	1
The	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
senate	1
is	1
not	1
less	1
indicated	1
by	1
the	1
propensity	1
of	1
all	1
single	1
and	1
numerous	1
assemblies	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
the	1
impulse	1
of	1
sudden	1
and	1
violent	1
passions,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
seduced	1
by	1
factious	1
leaders	1
into	1
intemperate	1
and	1
pernicious	1
resolutions.	1
Examples	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
might	1
be	1
cited	1
without	1
number;	1
and	1
from	1
proceedings	1
within	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
other	1
nations.	1
But	1
a	1
position	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
contradicted,	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
proved.	1
All	1
that	1
need	1
be	1
remarked	1
is,	1
that	1
a	1
body	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
correct	1
this	1
infirmity	1
ought	1
itself	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
consequently	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
less	1
numerous.	1
It	1
ought,	1
moreover,	1
to	1
possess	1
great	1
firmness,	1
and	1
consequently	1
ought	1
to	1
hold	1
its	1
authority	1
by	1
a	1
tenure	1
of	1
considerable	1
duration.	1
Thirdly.	1
Another	1
defect	1
to	1
be	1
supplied	1
by	1
a	1
senate	1
lies	1
in	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
due	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
the	1
objects	1
and	1
principles	1
of	1
legislation.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
an	1
assembly	1
of	1
men	1
called	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
from	1
pursuits	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
nature,	1
continued	1
in	1
appointment	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time,	1
and	1
led	1
by	1
no	1
permanent	1
motive	1
to	1
devote	1
the	1
intervals	1
of	1
public	1
occupation	1
to	1
a	1
study	1
of	1
the	1
laws,	1
the	1
affairs,	1
and	1
the	1
comprehensive	1
interests	1
of	1
their	1
country,	1
should,	1
if	1
left	1
wholly	1
to	1
themselves,	1
escape	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
important	1
errors	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
their	1
legislative	1
trust.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
affirmed,	1
on	1
the	1
best	1
grounds,	1
that	1
no	1
small	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
embarrassments	1
of	1
America	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
charged	1
on	1
the	1
blunders	1
of	1
our	1
governments;	1
and	1
that	1
these	1
have	1
proceeded	1
from	1
the	1
heads	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
them.	1
What	1
indeed	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
repealing,	1
explaining,	1
and	1
amending	1
laws,	1
which	1
fill	1
and	1
disgrace	1
our	1
voluminous	1
codes,	1
but	1
so	1
many	1
monuments	1
of	1
deficient	1
wisdom;	1
so	1
many	1
impeachments	1
exhibited	1
by	1
each	1
succeeding	1
against	1
each	1
preceding	1
session;	1
so	1
many	1
admonitions	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
of	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
those	1
aids	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
expected	1
from	1
a	1
well-constituted	1
senate?	1
A	1
good	1
government	1
implies	1
two	1
things:	1
first,	1
fidelity	1
to	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
government,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
secondly,	1
a	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
by	1
which	1
that	1
object	1
can	1
be	1
best	1
attained.	1
Some	1
governments	1
are	1
deficient	1
in	1
both	1
these	1
qualities;	1
most	1
governments	1
are	1
deficient	1
in	1
the	1
first.	1
I	1
scruple	1
not	1
to	1
assert,	1
that	1
in	1
American	1
governments	1
too	1
little	1
attention	1
has	1
been	1
paid	1
to	1
the	1
last.	1
The	1
federal	1
Constitution	1
avoids	1
this	1
error;	1
and	1
what	1
merits	1
particular	1
notice,	1
it	1
provides	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
in	1
a	1
mode	1
which	1
increases	1
the	1
security	1
for	1
the	1
first.	1
Fourthly.	1
The	1
mutability	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
councils	1
arising	1
from	1
a	1
rapid	1
succession	1
of	1
new	1
members,	1
however	1
qualified	1
they	1
may	1
be,	1
points	1
out,	1
in	1
the	1
strongest	1
manner,	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
some	1
stable	1
institution	1
in	1
the	1
government.	1
Every	1
new	1
election	1
in	1
the	1
States	1
is	1
found	1
to	1
change	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
the	1
representatives.	1
From	1
this	1
change	1
of	1
men	1
must	1
proceed	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
opinions;	1
and	1
from	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
opinions,	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
measures.	1
But	1
a	1
continual	1
change	1
even	1
of	1
good	1
measures	1
is	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
every	1
rule	1
of	1
prudence	1
and	1
every	1
prospect	1
of	1
success.	1
The	1
remark	1
is	1
verified	1
in	1
private	1
life,	1
and	1
becomes	1
more	1
just,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
more	1
important,	1
in	1
national	1
transactions.	1
To	1
trace	1
the	1
mischievous	1
effects	1
of	1
a	1
mutable	1
government	1
would	1
fill	1
a	1
volume.	1
I	1
will	1
hint	1
a	1
few	1
only,	1
each	1
of	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
perceived	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
innumerable	1
others.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
it	1
forfeits	1
the	1
respect	1
and	1
confidence	1
of	1
other	1
nations,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
advantages	1
connected	1
with	1
national	1
character.	1
An	1
individual	1
who	1
is	1
observed	1
to	1
be	1
inconstant	1
to	1
his	1
plans,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
to	1
carry	1
on	1
his	1
affairs	1
without	1
any	1
plan	1
at	1
all,	1
is	1
marked	1
at	1
once,	1
by	1
all	1
prudent	1
people,	1
as	1
a	1
speedy	1
victim	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
unsteadiness	1
and	1
folly.	1
His	1
more	1
friendly	1
neighbors	1
may	1
pity	1
him,	1
but	1
all	1
will	1
decline	1
to	1
connect	1
their	1
fortunes	1
with	1
his;	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
few	1
will	1
seize	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
making	1
their	1
fortunes	1
out	1
of	1
his.	1
One	1
nation	1
is	1
to	1
another	1
what	1
one	1
individual	1
is	1
to	1
another;	1
with	1
this	1
melancholy	1
distinction	1
perhaps,	1
that	1
the	1
former,	1
with	1
fewer	1
of	1
the	1
benevolent	1
emotions	1
than	1
the	1
latter,	1
are	1
under	1
fewer	1
restraints	1
also	1
from	1
taking	1
undue	1
advantage	1
from	1
the	1
indiscretions	1
of	1
each	1
other.	1
Every	1
nation,	1
consequently,	1
whose	1
affairs	1
betray	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
wisdom	1
and	1
stability,	1
may	1
calculate	1
on	1
every	1
loss	1
which	1
can	1
be	1
sustained	1
from	1
the	1
more	1
systematic	1
policy	1
of	1
their	1
wiser	1
neighbors.	1
But	1
the	1
best	1
instruction	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
is	1
unhappily	1
conveyed	1
to	1
America	1
by	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
situation.	1
She	1
finds	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
held	1
in	1
no	1
respect	1
by	1
her	1
friends;	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
derision	1
of	1
her	1
enemies;	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
prey	1
to	1
every	1
nation	1
which	1
has	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
speculating	1
on	1
her	1
fluctuating	1
councils	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
affairs.	1
The	1
internal	1
effects	1
of	1
a	1
mutable	1
policy	1
are	1
still	1
more	1
calamitous.	1
It	1
poisons	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
liberty	1
itself.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
little	1
avail	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
that	1
the	1
laws	1
are	1
made	1
by	1
men	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
choice,	1
if	1
the	1
laws	1
be	1
so	1
voluminous	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
read,	1
or	1
so	1
incoherent	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
understood;	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
repealed	1
or	1
revised	1
before	1
they	1
are	1
promulgated,	1
or	1
undergo	1
such	1
incessant	1
changes	1
that	1
no	1
man,	1
who	1
knows	1
what	1
the	1
law	1
is	1
to-day,	1
can	1
guess	1
what	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
to-morrow.	1
Law	1
is	1
defined	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
rule	1
of	1
action;	1
but	1
how	1
can	1
that	1
be	1
a	1
rule,	1
which	1
is	1
little	1
known,	1
and	1
less	1
fixed?	1
Another	1
effect	1
of	1
public	1
instability	1
is	1
the	1
unreasonable	1
advantage	1
it	1
gives	1
to	1
the	1
sagacious,	1
the	1
enterprising,	1
and	1
the	1
moneyed	1
few	1
over	1
the	1
industrious	1
and	1
uniformed	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
Every	1
new	1
regulation	1
concerning	1
commerce	1
or	1
revenue,	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
affecting	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
different	1
species	1
of	1
property,	1
presents	1
a	1
new	1
harvest	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
watch	1
the	1
change,	1
and	1
can	1
trace	1
its	1
consequences;	1
a	1
harvest,	1
reared	1
not	1
by	1
themselves,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
toils	1
and	1
cares	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
their	1
fellow-citizens.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
with	1
some	1
truth	1
that	1
laws	1
are	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
FEW,	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
MANY.	1
In	1
another	1
point	1
of	1
view,	1
great	1
injury	1
results	1
from	1
an	1
unstable	1
government.	1
The	1
want	1
of	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
councils	1
damps	1
every	1
useful	1
undertaking,	1
the	1
success	1
and	1
profit	1
of	1
which	1
may	1
depend	1
on	1
a	1
continuance	1
of	1
existing	1
arrangements.	1
What	1
prudent	1
merchant	1
will	1
hazard	1
his	1
fortunes	1
in	1
any	1
new	1
branch	1
of	1
commerce	1
when	1
he	1
knows	1
not	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
plans	1
may	1
be	1
rendered	1
unlawful	1
before	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
executed?	1
What	1
farmer	1
or	1
manufacturer	1
will	1
lay	1
himself	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
encouragement	1
given	1
to	1
any	1
particular	1
cultivation	1
or	1
establishment,	1
when	1
he	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
assurance	1
that	1
his	1
preparatory	1
labors	1
and	1
advances	1
will	1
not	1
render	1
him	1
a	1
victim	1
to	1
an	1
inconstant	1
government?	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
no	1
great	1
improvement	1
or	1
laudable	1
enterprise	1
can	1
go	1
forward	1
which	1
requires	1
the	1
auspices	1
of	1
a	1
steady	1
system	1
of	1
national	1
policy.	1
But	1
the	1
most	1
deplorable	1
effect	1
of	1
all	1
is	1
that	1
diminution	1
of	1
attachment	1
and	1
reverence	1
which	1
steals	1
into	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
towards	1
a	1
political	1
system	1
which	1
betrays	1
so	1
many	1
marks	1
of	1
infirmity,	1
and	1
disappoints	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
flattering	1
hopes.	1
No	1
government,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
individual,	1
will	1
long	1
be	1
respected	1
without	1
being	1
truly	1
respectable;	1
nor	1
be	1
truly	1
respectable,	1
without	1
possessing	1
a	1
certain	1
portion	1
of	1
order	1
and	1
stability.	1

A	1
FIFTH	1
desideratum,	1
illustrating	1
the	1
utility	1
of	1
a	1
senate,	1
is	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
due	1
sense	1
of	1
national	1
character.	1
Without	1
a	1
select	1
and	1
stable	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
the	1
esteem	1
of	1
foreign	1
powers	1
will	1
not	1
only	1
be	1
forfeited	1
by	1
an	1
unenlightened	1
and	1
variable	1
policy,	1
proceeding	1
from	1
the	1
causes	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
but	1
the	1
national	1
councils	1
will	1
not	1
possess	1
that	1
sensibility	1
to	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
which	1
is	1
perhaps	1
not	1
less	1
necessary	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
merit,	1
than	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
obtain,	1
its	1
respect	1
and	1
confidence.	1
An	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
other	1
nations	1
is	1
important	1
to	1
every	1
government	1
for	1
two	1
reasons:	1
the	1
one	1
is,	1
that,	1
independently	1
of	1
the	1
merits	1
of	1
any	1
particular	1
plan	1
or	1
measure,	1
it	1
is	1
desirable,	1
on	1
various	1
accounts,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
appear	1
to	1
other	1
nations	1
as	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
honorable	1
policy;	1
the	1
second	1
is,	1
that	1
in	1
doubtful	1
cases,	1
particularly	1
where	1
the	1
national	1
councils	1
may	1
be	1
warped	1
by	1
some	1
strong	1
passion	1
or	1
momentary	1
interest,	1
the	1
presumed	1
or	1
known	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
impartial	1
world	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
guide	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
followed.	1
What	1
has	1
not	1
America	1
lost	1
by	1
her	1
want	1
of	1
character	1
with	1
foreign	1
nations;	1
and	1
how	1
many	1
errors	1
and	1
follies	1
would	1
she	1
not	1
have	1
avoided,	1
if	1
the	1
justice	1
and	1
propriety	1
of	1
her	1
measures	1
had,	1
in	1
every	1
instance,	1
been	1
previously	1
tried	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
would	1
probably	1
appear	1
to	1
the	1
unbiased	1
part	1
of	1
mankind?	1
Yet	1
however	1
requisite	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
national	1
character	1
may	1
be,	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
sufficiently	1
possessed	1
by	1
a	1
numerous	1
and	1
changeable	1
body.	1
It	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
a	1
number	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
a	1
sensible	1
degree	1
of	1
the	1
praise	1
and	1
blame	1
of	1
public	1
measures	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
portion	1
of	1
each	1
individual;	1
or	1
in	1
an	1
assembly	1
so	1
durably	1
invested	1
with	1
public	1
trust,	1
that	1
the	1
pride	1
and	1
consequence	1
of	1
its	1
members	1
may	1
be	1
sensibly	1
incorporated	1
with	1
the	1
reputation	1
and	1
prosperity	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
The	1
half-yearly	1
representatives	1
of	1
Rhode	1
Island	1
would	1
probably	1
have	1
been	1
little	1
affected	1
in	1
their	1
deliberations	1
on	1
the	1
iniquitous	1
measures	1
of	1
that	1
State,	1
by	1
arguments	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
light	1
in	1
which	1
such	1
measures	1
would	1
be	1
viewed	1
by	1
foreign	1
nations,	1
or	1
even	1
by	1
the	1
sister	1
States;	1
whilst	1
it	1
can	1
scarcely	1
be	1
doubted	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
a	1
select	1
and	1
stable	1
body	1
had	1
been	1
necessary,	1
a	1
regard	1
to	1
national	1
character	1
alone	1
would	1
have	1
prevented	1
the	1
calamities	1
under	1
which	1
that	1
misguided	1
people	1
is	1
now	1
laboring.	1
I	1
add,	1
as	1
a	1
SIXTH	1
defect	1
the	1
want,	1
in	1
some	1
important	1
cases,	1
of	1
a	1
due	1
responsibility	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
arising	1
from	1
that	1
frequency	1
of	1
elections	1
which	1
in	1
other	1
cases	1
produces	1
this	1
responsibility.	1
This	1
remark	1
will,	1
perhaps,	1
appear	1
not	1
only	1
new,	1
but	1
paradoxical.	1
It	1
must	1
nevertheless	1
be	1
acknowledged,	1
when	1
explained,	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
undeniable	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
important.	1
Responsibility,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
reasonable,	1
must	1
be	1
limited	1
to	1
objects	1
within	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
responsible	1
party,	1
and	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
effectual,	1
must	1
relate	1
to	1
operations	1
of	1
that	1
power,	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
ready	1
and	1
proper	1
judgment	1
can	1
be	1
formed	1
by	1
the	1
constituents.	1
The	1
objects	1
of	1
government	1
may	1
be	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
general	1
classes:	1
the	1
one	1
depending	1
on	1
measures	1
which	1
have	1
singly	1
an	1
immediate	1
and	1
sensible	1
operation;	1
the	1
other	1
depending	1
on	1
a	1
succession	1
of	1
well-chosen	1
and	1
well-connected	1
measures,	1
which	1
have	1
a	1
gradual	1
and	1
perhaps	1
unobserved	1
operation.	1
The	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
description	1
to	1
the	1
collective	1
and	1
permanent	1
welfare	1
of	1
every	1
country,	1
needs	1
no	1
explanation.	1
And	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
an	1
assembly	1
elected	1
for	1
so	1
short	1
a	1
term	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
provide	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
links	1
in	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
measures,	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
general	1
welfare	1
may	1
essentially	1
depend,	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
answerable	1
for	1
the	1
final	1
result,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
steward	1
or	1
tenant,	1
engaged	1
for	1
one	1
year,	1
could	1
be	1
justly	1
made	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
places	1
or	1
improvements	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
accomplished	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
years.	1
Nor	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
for	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
estimate	1
the	1
SHARE	1
of	1
influence	1
which	1
their	1
annual	1
assemblies	1
may	1
respectively	1
have	1
on	1
events	1
resulting	1
from	1
the	1
mixed	1
transactions	1
of	1
several	1
years.	1
It	1
is	1
sufficiently	1
difficult	1
to	1
preserve	1
a	1
personal	1
responsibility	1
in	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
a	1
NUMEROUS	1
body,	1
for	1
such	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
as	1
have	1
an	1
immediate,	1
detached,	1
and	1
palpable	1
operation	1
on	1
its	1
constituents.	1
The	1
proper	1
remedy	1
for	1
this	1
defect	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
additional	1
body	1
in	1
the	1
legislative	1
department,	1
which,	1
having	1
sufficient	1
permanency	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
such	1
objects	1
as	1
require	1
a	1
continued	1
attention,	1
and	1
a	1
train	1
of	1
measures,	1
may	1
be	1
justly	1
and	1
effectually	1
answerable	1
for	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
those	1
objects.	1
Thus	1
far	1
I	1
have	1
considered	1
the	1
circumstances	1
which	1
point	1
out	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
well-constructed	1
Senate	1
only	1
as	1
they	1
relate	1
to	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
To	1
a	1
people	1
as	1
little	1
blinded	1
by	1
prejudice	1
or	1
corrupted	1
by	1
flattery	1
as	1
those	1
whom	1
I	1
address,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
scruple	1
to	1
add,	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
institution	1
may	1
be	1
sometimes	1
necessary	1
as	1
a	1
defense	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
against	1
their	1
own	1
temporary	1
errors	1
and	1
delusions.	1
As	1
the	1
cool	1
and	1
deliberate	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
ought,	1
in	1
all	1
governments,	1
and	1
actually	1
will,	1
in	1
all	1
free	1
governments,	1
ultimately	1
prevail	1
over	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
its	1
rulers;	1
so	1
there	1
are	1
particular	1
moments	1
in	1
public	1
affairs	1
when	1
the	1
people,	1
stimulated	1
by	1
some	1
irregular	1
passion,	1
or	1
some	1
illicit	1
advantage,	1
or	1
misled	1
by	1
the	1
artful	1
misrepresentations	1
of	1
interested	1
men,	1
may	1
call	1
for	1
measures	1
which	1
they	1
themselves	1
will	1
afterwards	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
ready	1
to	1
lament	1
and	1
condemn.	1
In	1
these	1
critical	1
moments,	1
how	1
salutary	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
interference	1
of	1
some	1
temperate	1
and	1
respectable	1
body	1
of	1
citizens,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
misguided	1
career,	1
and	1
to	1
suspend	1
the	1
blow	1
meditated	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
against	1
themselves,	1
until	1
reason,	1
justice,	1
and	1
truth	1
can	1
regain	1
their	1
authority	1
over	1
the	1
public	1
mind?	1
What	1
bitter	1
anguish	1
would	1
not	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
Athens	1
have	1
often	1
escaped	1
if	1
their	1
government	1
had	1
contained	1
so	1
provident	1
a	1
safeguard	1
against	1
the	1
tyranny	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
passions?	1
Popular	1
liberty	1
might	1
then	1
have	1
escaped	1
the	1
indelible	1
reproach	1
of	1
decreeing	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
citizens	1
the	1
hemlock	1
on	1
one	1
day	1
and	1
statues	1
on	1
the	1
next.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
suggested,	1
that	1
a	1
people	1
spread	1
over	1
an	1
extensive	1
region	1
cannot,	1
like	1
the	1
crowded	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
district,	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
infection	1
of	1
violent	1
passions,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
combining	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
unjust	1
measures.	1
I	1
am	1
far	1
from	1
denying	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
distinction	1
of	1
peculiar	1
importance.	1
I	1
have,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
endeavored	1
in	1
a	1
former	1
paper	1
to	1
show,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
recommendations	1
of	1
a	1
confederated	1
republic.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
this	1
advantage	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
superseding	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
auxiliary	1
precautions.	1
It	1
may	1
even	1
be	1
remarked,	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
extended	1
situation,	1
which	1
will	1
exempt	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
from	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
dangers	1
incident	1
to	1
lesser	1
republics,	1
will	1
expose	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
inconveniency	1
of	1
remaining	1
for	1
a	1
longer	1
time	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
those	1
misrepresentations	1
which	1
the	1
combined	1
industry	1
of	1
interested	1
men	1
may	1
succeed	1
in	1
distributing	1
among	1
them.	1
It	1
adds	1
no	1
small	1
weight	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
considerations,	1
to	1
recollect	1
that	1
history	1
informs	1
us	1
of	1
no	1
long-lived	1
republic	1
which	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
senate.	1
Sparta,	1
Rome,	1
and	1
Carthage	1
are,	1
in	1
fact,	1
the	1
only	1
states	1
to	1
whom	1
that	1
character	1
can	1
be	1
applied.	1
In	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
first	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
senate	1
for	1
life.	1
The	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
senate	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
is	1
less	1
known.	1
Circumstantial	1
evidence	1
makes	1
it	1
probable	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
different	1
in	1
this	1
particular	1
from	1
the	1
two	1
others.	1
It	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
certain,	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
some	1
quality	1
or	1
other	1
which	1
rendered	1
it	1
an	1
anchor	1
against	1
popular	1
fluctuations;	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
smaller	1
council,	1
drawn	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
senate,	1
was	1
appointed	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
life,	1
but	1
filled	1
up	1
vacancies	1
itself.	1
These	1
examples,	1
though	1
as	1
unfit	1
for	1
the	1
imitation,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
repugnant	1
to	1
the	1
genius,	1
of	1
America,	1
are,	1
notwithstanding,	1
when	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
fugitive	1
and	1
turbulent	1
existence	1
of	1
other	1
ancient	1
republics,	1
very	1
instructive	1
proofs	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
some	1
institution	1
that	1
will	1
blend	1
stability	1
with	1
liberty.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
unaware	1
of	1
the	1
circumstances	1
which	1
distinguish	1
the	1
American	1
from	1
other	1
popular	1
governments,	1
as	1
well	1
ancient	1
as	1
modern;	1
and	1
which	1
render	1
extreme	1
circumspection	1
necessary,	1
in	1
reasoning	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
case	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
But	1
after	1
allowing	1
due	1
weight	1
to	1
this	1
consideration,	1
it	1
may	1
still	1
be	1
maintained,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
points	1
of	1
similitude	1
which	1
render	1
these	1
examples	1
not	1
unworthy	1
of	1
our	1
attention.	1
Many	1
of	1
the	1
defects,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
which	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
supplied	1
by	1
a	1
senatorial	1
institution,	1
are	1
common	1
to	1
a	1
numerous	1
assembly	1
frequently	1
elected	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
themselves.	1
There	1
are	1
others	1
peculiar	1
to	1
the	1
former,	1
which	1
require	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
institution.	1
The	1
people	1
can	1
never	1
wilfully	1
betray	1
their	1
own	1
interests;	1
but	1
they	1
may	1
possibly	1
be	1
betrayed	1
by	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
and	1
the	1
danger	1
will	1
be	1
evidently	1
greater	1
where	1
the	1
whole	1
legislative	1
trust	1
is	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
one	1
body	1
of	1
men,	1
than	1
where	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
separate	1
and	1
dissimilar	1
bodies	1
is	1
required	1
in	1
every	1
public	1
act.	1
The	1
difference	1
most	1
relied	1
on,	1
between	1
the	1
American	1
and	1
other	1
republics,	1
consists	1
in	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
representation;	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
pivot	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
former	1
move,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
latter,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
the	1
ancient	1
part	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
use	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
of	1
this	1
difference,	1
in	1
reasonings	1
contained	1
in	1
former	1
papers,	1
will	1
have	1
shown	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
disposed	1
neither	1
to	1
deny	1
its	1
existence	1
nor	1
to	1
undervalue	1
its	1
importance.	1
I	1
feel	1
the	1
less	1
restraint,	1
therefore,	1
in	1
observing,	1
that	1
the	1
position	1
concerning	1
the	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
governments	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
representation,	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
precisely	1
true	1
in	1
the	1
latitude	1
commonly	1
given	1
to	1
it.	1
Without	1
entering	1
into	1
a	1
disquisition	1
which	1
here	1
would	1
be	1
misplaced,	1
I	1
will	1
refer	1
to	1
a	1
few	1
known	1
facts,	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
advance.	1
In	1
the	1
most	1
pure	1
democracies	1
of	1
Greece,	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
functions	1
were	1
performed,	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
themselves,	1
but	1
by	1
officers	1
elected	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
REPRESENTING	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
EXECUTIVE	1
capacity.	1
Prior	1
to	1
the	1
reform	1
of	1
Solon,	1
Athens	1
was	1
governed	1
by	1
nine	1
Archons,	1
annually	1
ELECTED	1
BY	1
THE	1
PEOPLE	1
AT	1
LARGE.	1
The	1
degree	1
of	1
power	1
delegated	1
to	1
them	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
great	1
obscurity.	1
Subsequent	1
to	1
that	1
period,	1
we	1
find	1
an	1
assembly,	1
first	1
of	1
four,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
of	1
six	1
hundred	1
members,	1
annually	1
ELECTED	1
BY	1
THE	1
PEOPLE;	1
and	1
PARTIALLY	1
representing	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
LEGISLATIVE	1
capacity,	1
since	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
only	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
function	1
of	1
making	1
laws,	1
but	1
had	1
the	1
exclusive	1
right	1
of	1
originating	1
legislative	1
propositions	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
The	1
senate	1
of	1
Carthage,	1
also,	1
whatever	1
might	1
be	1
its	1
power,	1
or	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
its	1
appointment,	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
ELECTIVE	1
by	1
the	1
suffrages	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
Similar	1
instances	1
might	1
be	1
traced	1
in	1
most,	1
if	1
not	1
all	1
the	1
popular	1
governments	1
of	1
antiquity.	1
Lastly,	1
in	1
Sparta	1
we	1
meet	1
with	1
the	1
Ephori,	1
and	1
in	1
Rome	1
with	1
the	1
Tribunes;	1
two	1
bodies,	1
small	1
indeed	1
in	1
numbers,	1
but	1
annually	1
ELECTED	1
BY	1
THE	1
WHOLE	1
BODY	1
OF	1
THE	1
PEOPLE,	1
and	1
considered	1
as	1
the	1
REPRESENTATIVES	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
almost	1
in	1
their	1
PLENIPOTENTIARY	1
capacity.	1
The	1
Cosmi	1
of	1
Crete	1
were	1
also	1
annually	1
ELECTED	1
BY	1
THE	1
PEOPLE,	1
and	1
have	1
been	1
considered	1
by	1
some	1
authors	1
as	1
an	1
institution	1
analogous	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
Sparta	1
and	1
Rome,	1
with	1
this	1
difference	1
only,	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
that	1
representative	1
body	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
suffrage	1
was	1
communicated	1
to	1
a	1
part	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
From	1
these	1
facts,	1
to	1
which	1
many	1
others	1
might	1
be	1
added,	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
representation	1
was	1
neither	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
ancients	1
nor	1
wholly	1
overlooked	1
in	1
their	1
political	1
constitutions.	1
The	1
true	1
distinction	1
between	1
these	1
and	1
the	1
American	1
governments,	1
lies	1
IN	1
THE	1
TOTAL	1
EXCLUSION	1
OF	1
THE	1
PEOPLE,	1
IN	1
THEIR	1
COLLECTIVE	1
CAPACITY,	1
from	1
any	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
LATTER,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
TOTAL	1
EXCLUSION	1
OF	1
THE	1
REPRESENTATIVES	1
OF	1
THE	1
PEOPLE	1
from	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
FORMER.	1
The	1
distinction,	1
however,	1
thus	1
qualified,	1
must	1
be	1
admitted	1
to	1
leave	1
a	1
most	1
advantageous	1
superiority	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
But	1
to	1
insure	1
to	1
this	1
advantage	1
its	1
full	1
effect,	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
careful	1
not	1
to	1
separate	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
advantage,	1
of	1
an	1
extensive	1
territory.	1
For	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
believed,	1
that	1
any	1
form	1
of	1
representative	1
government	1
could	1
have	1
succeeded	1
within	1
the	1
narrow	1
limits	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
democracies	1
of	1
Greece.	1
In	1
answer	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
arguments,	1
suggested	1
by	1
reason,	1
illustrated	1
by	1
examples,	1
and	1
enforced	1
by	1
our	1
own	1
experience,	1
the	1
jealous	1
adversary	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
will	1
probably	1
content	1
himself	1
with	1
repeating,	1
that	1
a	1
senate	1
appointed	1
not	1
immediately	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
term	1
of	1
six	1
years,	1
must	1
gradually	1
acquire	1
a	1
dangerous	1
pre-eminence	1
in	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
finally	1
transform	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
tyrannical	1
aristocracy.	1
To	1
this	1
general	1
answer,	1
the	1
general	1
reply	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
sufficient,	1
that	1
liberty	1
may	1
be	1
endangered	1
by	1
the	1
abuses	1
of	1
liberty	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
abuses	1
of	1
power;	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
numerous	1
instances	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
latter;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
former,	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
latter,	1
are	1
apparently	1
most	1
to	1
be	1
apprehended	1
by	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
But	1
a	1
more	1
particular	1
reply	1
may	1
be	1
given.	1
Before	1
such	1
a	1
revolution	1
can	1
be	1
effected,	1
the	1
Senate,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
observed,	1
must	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
corrupt	1
itself;	1
must	1
next	1
corrupt	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures;	1
must	1
then	1
corrupt	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives;	1
and	1
must	1
finally	1
corrupt	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large.	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
Senate	1
must	1
be	1
first	1
corrupted	1
before	1
it	1
can	1
attempt	1
an	1
establishment	1
of	1
tyranny.	1
Without	1
corrupting	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
it	1
cannot	1
prosecute	1
the	1
attempt,	1
because	1
the	1
periodical	1
change	1
of	1
members	1
would	1
otherwise	1
regenerate	1
the	1
whole	1
body.	1
Without	1
exerting	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
corruption	1
with	1
equal	1
success	1
on	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
the	1
opposition	1
of	1
that	1
coequal	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
would	1
inevitably	1
defeat	1
the	1
attempt;	1
and	1
without	1
corrupting	1
the	1
people	1
themselves,	1
a	1
succession	1
of	1
new	1
representatives	1
would	1
speedily	1
restore	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
their	1
pristine	1
order.	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
man	1
who	1
can	1
seriously	1
persuade	1
himself	1
that	1
the	1
proposed	1
Senate	1
can,	1
by	1
any	1
possible	1
means	1
within	1
the	1
compass	1
of	1
human	1
address,	1
arrive	1
at	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
a	1
lawless	1
ambition,	1
through	1
all	1
these	1
obstructions?	1
If	1
reason	1
condemns	1
the	1
suspicion,	1
the	1
same	1
sentence	1
is	1
pronounced	1
by	1
experience.	1
The	1
constitution	1
of	1
Maryland	1
furnishes	1
the	1
most	1
apposite	1
example.	1
The	1
Senate	1
of	1
that	1
State	1
is	1
elected,	1
as	1
the	1
federal	1
Senate	1
will	1
be,	1
indirectly	1
by	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
term	1
less	1
by	1
one	1
year	1
only	1
than	1
the	1
federal	1
Senate.	1
It	1
is	1
distinguished,	1
also,	1
by	1
the	1
remarkable	1
prerogative	1
of	1
filling	1
up	1
its	1
own	1
vacancies	1
within	1
the	1
term	1
of	1
its	1
appointment,	1
and,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
is	1
not	1
under	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
any	1
such	1
rotation	1
as	1
is	1
provided	1
for	1
the	1
federal	1
Senate.	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
other	1
lesser	1
distinctions,	1
which	1
would	1
expose	1
the	1
former	1
to	1
colorable	1
objections,	1
that	1
do	1
not	1
lie	1
against	1
the	1
latter.	1
If	1
the	1
federal	1
Senate,	1
therefore,	1
really	1
contained	1
the	1
danger	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
loudly	1
proclaimed,	1
some	1
symptoms	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
a	1
like	1
danger	1
ought	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
betrayed	1
by	1
the	1
Senate	1
of	1
Maryland,	1
but	1
no	1
such	1
symptoms	1
have	1
appeared.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
the	1
jealousies	1
at	1
first	1
entertained	1
by	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
description	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
view	1
with	1
terror	1
the	1
correspondent	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
Constitution,	1
have	1
been	1
gradually	1
extinguished	1
by	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
experiment;	1
and	1
the	1
Maryland	1
constitution	1
is	1
daily	1
deriving,	1
from	1
the	1
salutary	1
operation	1
of	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
it,	1
a	1
reputation	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
will	1
probably	1
not	1
be	1
rivalled	1
by	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
State	1
in	1
the	1
Union.	1
But	1
if	1
any	1
thing	1
could	1
silence	1
the	1
jealousies	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
British	1
example.	1
The	1
Senate	1
there	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
elected	1
for	1
a	1
term	1
of	1
six	1
years,	1
and	1
of	1
being	1
unconfined	1
to	1
particular	1
families	1
or	1
fortunes,	1
is	1
an	1
hereditary	1
assembly	1
of	1
opulent	1
nobles.	1
The	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
elected	1
for	1
two	1
years,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
is	1
elected	1
for	1
seven	1
years,	1
and,	1
in	1
very	1
great	1
proportion,	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
Here,	1
unquestionably,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
full	1
display	1
the	1
aristocratic	1
usurpations	1
and	1
tyranny	1
which	1
are	1
at	1
some	1
future	1
period	1
to	1
be	1
exemplified	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
Unfortunately,	1
however,	1
for	1
the	1
anti-federal	1
argument,	1
the	1
British	1
history	1
informs	1
us	1
that	1
this	1
hereditary	1
assembly	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
defend	1
itself	1
against	1
the	1
continual	1
encroachments	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives;	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
no	1
sooner	1
lost	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
monarch,	1
than	1
it	1
was	1
actually	1
crushed	1
by	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
popular	1
branch.	1
As	1
far	1
as	1
antiquity	1
can	1
instruct	1
us	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
its	1
examples	1
support	1
the	1
reasoning	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
employed.	1
In	1
Sparta,	1
the	1
Ephori,	1
the	1
annual	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
were	1
found	1
an	1
overmatch	1
for	1
the	1
senate	1
for	1
life,	1
continually	1
gained	1
on	1
its	1
authority	1
and	1
finally	1
drew	1
all	1
power	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
hands.	1
The	1
Tribunes	1
of	1
Rome,	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
prevailed,	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
known,	1
in	1
almost	1
every	1
contest	1
with	1
the	1
senate	1
for	1
life,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
gained	1
the	1
most	1
complete	1
triumph	1
over	1
it.	1
The	1
fact	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
remarkable,	1
as	1
unanimity	1
was	1
required	1
in	1
every	1
act	1
of	1
the	1
Tribunes,	1
even	1
after	1
their	1
number	1
was	1
augmented	1
to	1
ten.	1
It	1
proves	1
the	1
irresistible	1
force	1
possessed	1
by	1
that	1
branch	1
of	1
a	1
free	1
government,	1
which	1
has	1
the	1
people	1
on	1
its	1
side.	1
To	1
these	1
examples	1
might	1
be	1
added	1
that	1
of	1
Carthage,	1
whose	1
senate,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Polybius,	1
instead	1
of	1
drawing	1
all	1
power	1
into	1
its	1
vortex,	1
had,	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
Punic	1
War,	1
lost	1
almost	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
its	1
original	1
portion.	1
Besides	1
the	1
conclusive	1
evidence	1
resulting	1
from	1
this	1
assemblage	1
of	1
facts,	1
that	1
the	1
federal	1
Senate	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
transform	1
itself,	1
by	1
gradual	1
usurpations,	1
into	1
an	1
independent	1
and	1
aristocratic	1
body,	1
we	1
are	1
warranted	1
in	1
believing,	1
that	1
if	1
such	1
a	1
revolution	1
should	1
ever	1
happen	1
from	1
causes	1
which	1
the	1
foresight	1
of	1
man	1
cannot	1
guard	1
against,	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
with	1
the	1
people	1
on	1
their	1
side,	1
will	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
bring	1
back	1
the	1
Constitution	1
to	1
its	1
primitive	1
form	1
and	1
principles.	1
Against	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
immediate	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
nothing	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
maintain	1
even	1
the	1
constitutional	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
but	1
such	1
a	1
display	1
of	1
enlightened	1
policy,	1
and	1
attachment	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
good,	1
as	1
will	1
divide	1
with	1
that	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
the	1
affections	1
and	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
entire	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
themselves.	1

From	1

Packet.	1
Friday,	1

JAY	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
IT	1
IS	1
a	1
just	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
new	1
observation,	1
that	1
enemies	1
to	1
particular	1
persons,	1
and	1
opponents	1
to	1
particular	1
measures,	1
seldom	1
confine	1
their	1
censures	1
to	1
such	1
things	1
only	1
in	1
either	1
as	1
are	1
worthy	1
of	1
blame.	1
Unless	1
on	1
this	1
principle,	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
motives	1
of	1
their	1
conduct,	1
who	1
condemn	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
in	1
the	1
aggregate,	1
and	1
treat	1
with	1
severity	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
unexceptionable	1
articles	1
in	1
it.	1
The	1
second	1
section	1
gives	1
power	1
to	1
the	1
President,	1
"BY	1
AND	1
WITH	1
THE	1
ADVICE	1
AND	1
CONSENT	1
OF	1
THE	1
SENATE,	1
TO	1
MAKE	1
TREATIES,	1
PROVIDED	1
TWO	1
THIRDS	1
OF	1
THE	1
SENATORS	1
PRESENT	1
CONCUR."	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties	1
is	1
an	1
important	1
one,	1
especially	1
as	1
it	1
relates	1
to	1
war,	1
peace,	1
and	1
commerce;	1
and	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
delegated	1
but	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
mode,	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
precautions,	1
as	1
will	1
afford	1
the	1
highest	1
security	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
exercised	1
by	1
men	1
the	1
best	1
qualified	1
for	1
the	1
purpose,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
most	1
conducive	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
good.	1
The	1
convention	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
attentive	1
to	1
both	1
these	1
points:	1
they	1
have	1
directed	1
the	1
President	1
to	1
be	1
chosen	1
by	1
select	1
bodies	1
of	1
electors,	1
to	1
be	1
deputed	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
that	1
express	1
purpose;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
committed	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
senators	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures.	1
This	1
mode	1
has,	1
in	1
such	1
cases,	1
vastly	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
elections	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
their	1
collective	1
capacity,	1
where	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
party	1
zeal,	1
taking	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
supineness,	1
the	1
ignorance,	1
and	1
the	1
hopes	1
and	1
fears	1
of	1
the	1
unwary	1
and	1
interested,	1
often	1
places	1
men	1
in	1
office	1
by	1
the	1
votes	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
electors.	1
As	1
the	1
select	1
assemblies	1
for	1
choosing	1
the	1
President,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
who	1
appoint	1
the	1
senators,	1
will	1
in	1
general	1
be	1
composed	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
enlightened	1
and	1
respectable	1
citizens,	1
there	1
is	1
reason	1
to	1
presume	1
that	1
their	1
attention	1
and	1
their	1
votes	1
will	1
be	1
directed	1
to	1
those	1
men	1
only	1
who	1
have	1
become	1
the	1
most	1
distinguished	1
by	1
their	1
abilities	1
and	1
virtue,	1
and	1
in	1
whom	1
the	1
people	1
perceive	1
just	1
grounds	1
for	1
confidence.	1
The	1
Constitution	1
manifests	1
very	1
particular	1
attention	1
to	1
this	1
object.	1
By	1
excluding	1
men	1
under	1
thirty-five	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
office,	1
and	1
those	1
under	1
thirty	1
from	1
the	1
second,	1
it	1
confines	1
the	1
electors	1
to	1
men	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
people	1
have	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
judgment,	1
and	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
deceived	1
by	1
those	1
brilliant	1
appearances	1
of	1
genius	1
and	1
patriotism,	1
which,	1
like	1
transient	1
meteors,	1
sometimes	1
mislead	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
dazzle.	1
If	1
the	1
observation	1
be	1
well	1
founded,	1
that	1
wise	1
kings	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
served	1
by	1
able	1
ministers,	1
it	1
is	1
fair	1
to	1
argue,	1
that	1
as	1
an	1
assembly	1
of	1
select	1
electors	1
possess,	1
in	1
a	1
greater	1
degree	1
than	1
kings,	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
extensive	1
and	1
accurate	1
information	1
relative	1
to	1
men	1
and	1
characters,	1
so	1
will	1
their	1
appointments	1
bear	1
at	1
least	1
equal	1
marks	1
of	1
discretion	1
and	1
discernment.	1
The	1
inference	1
which	1
naturally	1
results	1
from	1
these	1
considerations	1
is	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
President	1
and	1
senators	1
so	1
chosen	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
best	1
understand	1
our	1
national	1
interests,	1
whether	1
considered	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
several	1
States	1
or	1
to	1
foreign	1
nations,	1
who	1
are	1
best	1
able	1
to	1
promote	1
those	1
interests,	1
and	1
whose	1
reputation	1
for	1
integrity	1
inspires	1
and	1
merits	1
confidence.	1
With	1
such	1
men	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties	1
may	1
be	1
safely	1
lodged.	1
Although	1
the	1
absolute	1
necessity	1
of	1
system,	1
in	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
any	1
business,	1
is	1
universally	1
known	1
and	1
acknowledged,	1
yet	1
the	1
high	1
importance	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
national	1
affairs	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
become	1
sufficiently	1
impressed	1
on	1
the	1
public	1
mind.	1
They	1
who	1
wish	1
to	1
commit	1
the	1
power	1
under	1
consideration	1
to	1
a	1
popular	1
assembly,	1
composed	1
of	1
members	1
constantly	1
coming	1
and	1
going	1
in	1
quick	1
succession,	1
seem	1
not	1
to	1
recollect	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
body	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
inadequate	1
to	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
those	1
great	1
objects,	1
which	1
require	1
to	1
be	1
steadily	1
contemplated	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
relations	1
and	1
circumstances,	1
and	1
which	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
approached	1
and	1
achieved	1
by	1
measures	1
which	1
not	1
only	1
talents,	1
but	1
also	1
exact	1
information,	1
and	1
often	1
much	1
time,	1
are	1
necessary	1
to	1
concert	1
and	1
to	1
execute.	1
It	1
was	1
wise,	1
therefore,	1
in	1
the	1
convention	1
to	1
provide,	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties	1
should	1
be	1
committed	1
to	1
able	1
and	1
honest	1
men,	1
but	1
also	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
continue	1
in	1
place	1
a	1
sufficient	1
time	1
to	1
become	1
perfectly	1
acquainted	1
with	1
our	1
national	1
concerns,	1
and	1
to	1
form	1
and	1
introduce	1
a	1
a	1
system	1
for	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
duration	1
prescribed	1
is	1
such	1
as	1
will	1
give	1
them	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
greatly	1
extending	1
their	1
political	1
information,	1
and	1
of	1
rendering	1
their	1
accumulating	1
experience	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
beneficial	1
to	1
their	1
country.	1
Nor	1
has	1
the	1
convention	1
discovered	1
less	1
prudence	1
in	1
providing	1
for	1
the	1
frequent	1
elections	1
of	1
senators	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
as	1
to	1
obviate	1
the	1
inconvenience	1
of	1
periodically	1
transferring	1
those	1
great	1
affairs	1
entirely	1
to	1
new	1
men;	1
for	1
by	1
leaving	1
a	1
considerable	1
residue	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
ones	1
in	1
place,	1
uniformity	1
and	1
order,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
constant	1
succession	1
of	1
official	1
information	1
will	1
be	1
preserved.	1
There	1
are	1
a	1
few	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
admit	1
that	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
trade	1
and	1
navigation	1
should	1
be	1
regulated	1
by	1
a	1
system	1
cautiously	1
formed	1
and	1
steadily	1
pursued;	1
and	1
that	1
both	1
our	1
treaties	1
and	1
our	1
laws	1
should	1
correspond	1
with	1
and	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
promote	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
of	1
much	1
consequence	1
that	1
this	1
correspondence	1
and	1
conformity	1
be	1
carefully	1
maintained;	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
assent	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
this	1
position	1
will	1
see	1
and	1
confess	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
provided	1
for	1
by	1
making	1
concurrence	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
necessary	1
both	1
to	1
treaties	1
and	1
to	1
laws.	1
It	1
seldom	1
happens	1
in	1
the	1
negotiation	1
of	1
treaties,	1
of	1
whatever	1
nature,	1
but	1
that	1
perfect	1
SECRECY	1
and	1
immediate	1
DESPATCH	1
are	1
sometimes	1
requisite.	1
These	1
are	1
cases	1
where	1
the	1
most	1
useful	1
intelligence	1
may	1
be	1
obtained,	1
if	1
the	1
persons	1
possessing	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
relieved	1
from	1
apprehensions	1
of	1
discovery.	1
Those	1
apprehensions	1
will	1
operate	1
on	1
those	1
persons	1
whether	1
they	1
are	1
actuated	1
by	1
mercenary	1
or	1
friendly	1
motives;	1
and	1
there	1
doubtless	1
are	1
many	1
of	1
both	1
descriptions,	1
who	1
would	1
rely	1
on	1
the	1
secrecy	1
of	1
the	1
President,	1
but	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
confide	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
popular	1
Assembly.	1
The	1
convention	1
have	1
done	1
well,	1
therefore,	1
in	1
so	1
disposing	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties,	1
that	1
although	1
the	1
President	1
must,	1
in	1
forming	1
them,	1
act	1
by	1
the	1
advice	1
and	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
yet	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
manage	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
intelligence	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
prudence	1
may	1
suggest.	1
They	1
who	1
have	1
turned	1
their	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
men,	1
must	1
have	1
perceived	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
tides	1
in	1
them;	1
tides	1
very	1
irregular	1
in	1
their	1
duration,	1
strength,	1
and	1
direction,	1
and	1
seldom	1
found	1
to	1
run	1
twice	1
exactly	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
or	1
measure.	1
To	1
discern	1
and	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
these	1
tides	1
in	1
national	1
affairs	1
is	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
preside	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
have	1
had	1
much	1
experience	1
on	1
this	1
head	1
inform	1
us,	1
that	1
there	1
frequently	1
are	1
occasions	1
when	1
days,	1
nay,	1
even	1
when	1
hours,	1
are	1
precious.	1
The	1
loss	1
of	1
a	1
battle,	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
a	1
prince,	1
the	1
removal	1
of	1
a	1
minister,	1
or	1
other	1
circumstances	1
intervening	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
present	1
posture	1
and	1
aspect	1
of	1
affairs,	1
may	1
turn	1
the	1
most	1
favorable	1
tide	1
into	1
a	1
course	1
opposite	1
to	1
our	1
wishes.	1
As	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
cabinet,	1
there	1
are	1
moments	1
to	1
be	1
seized	1
as	1
they	1
pass,	1
and	1
they	1
who	1
preside	1
in	1
either	1
should	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
capacity	1
to	1
improve	1
them.	1
So	1
often	1
and	1
so	1
essentially	1
have	1
we	1
heretofore	1
suffered	1
from	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
secrecy	1
and	1
despatch,	1
that	1
the	1
Constitution	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
inexcusably	1
defective,	1
if	1
no	1
attention	1
had	1
been	1
paid	1
to	1
those	1
objects.	1
Those	1
matters	1
which	1
in	1
negotiations	1
usually	1
require	1
the	1
most	1
secrecy	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
despatch,	1
are	1
those	1
preparatory	1
and	1
auxiliary	1
measures	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
otherwise	1
important	1
in	1
a	1
national	1
view,	1
than	1
as	1
they	1
tend	1
to	1
facilitate	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
the	1
negotiation.	1
For	1
these,	1
the	1
President	1
will	1
find	1
no	1
difficulty	1
to	1
provide;	1
and	1
should	1
any	1
circumstance	1
occur	1
which	1
requires	1
the	1
advice	1
and	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
he	1
may	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
convene	1
them.	1
Thus	1
we	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
Constitution	1
provides	1
that	1
our	1
negotiations	1
for	1
treaties	1
shall	1
have	1
every	1
advantage	1
which	1
can	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
talents,	1
information,	1
integrity,	1
and	1
deliberate	1
investigations,	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
and	1
from	1
secrecy	1
and	1
despatch	1
on	1
the	1
other.	1
But	1
to	1
this	1
plan,	1
as	1
to	1
most	1
others	1
that	1
have	1
ever	1
appeared,	1
objections	1
are	1
contrived	1
and	1
urged.	1
Some	1
are	1
displeased	1
with	1
it,	1
not	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
any	1
errors	1
or	1
defects	1
in	1
it,	1
but	1
because,	1
as	1
the	1
treaties,	1
when	1
made,	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
laws,	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
only	1
by	1
men	1
invested	1
with	1
legislative	1
authority.	1
These	1
gentlemen	1
seem	1
not	1
to	1
consider	1
that	1
the	1
judgments	1
of	1
our	1
courts,	1
and	1
the	1
commissions	1
constitutionally	1
given	1
by	1
our	1
governor,	1
are	1
as	1
valid	1
and	1
as	1
binding	1
on	1
all	1
persons	1
whom	1
they	1
concern,	1
as	1
the	1
laws	1
passed	1
by	1
our	1
legislature.	1
All	1
constitutional	1
acts	1
of	1
power,	1
whether	1
in	1
the	1
executive	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
judicial	1
department,	1
have	1
as	1
much	1
legal	1
validity	1
and	1
obligation	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
proceeded	1
from	1
the	1
legislature;	1
and	1
therefore,	1
whatever	1
name	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties,	1
or	1
however	1
obligatory	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
when	1
made,	1
certain	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
may,	1
with	1
much	1
propriety,	1
commit	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
a	1
distinct	1
body	1
from	1
the	1
legislature,	1
the	1
executive,	1
or	1
the	1
judicial.	1
It	1
surely	1
does	1
not	1
follow,	1
that	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
laws	1
to	1
the	1
legislature,	1
that	1
therefore	1
they	1
should	1
likewise	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
every	1
other	1
act	1
of	1
sovereignty	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
citizens	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
and	1
affected.	1
Others,	1
though	1
content	1
that	1
treaties	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
mode	1
proposed,	1
are	1
averse	1
to	1
their	1
being	1
the	1
SUPREME	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
land.	1
They	1
insist,	1
and	1
profess	1
to	1
believe,	1
that	1
treaties	1
like	1
acts	1
of	1
assembly,	1
should	1
be	1
repealable	1
at	1
pleasure.	1
This	1
idea	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
new	1
and	1
peculiar	1
to	1
this	1
country,	1
but	1
new	1
errors,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
new	1
truths,	1
often	1
appear.	1
These	1
gentlemen	1
would	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
reflect	1
that	1
a	1
treaty	1
is	1
only	1
another	1
name	1
for	1
a	1
bargain,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
nation	1
who	1
would	1
make	1
any	1
bargain	1
with	1
us,	1
which	1
should	1
be	1
binding	1
on	1
them	1
ABSOLUTELY,	1
but	1
on	1
us	1
only	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
we	1
may	1
think	1
proper	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
by	1
it.	1
They	1
who	1
make	1
laws	1
may,	1
without	1
doubt,	1
amend	1
or	1
repeal	1
them;	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
disputed	1
that	1
they	1
who	1
make	1
treaties	1
may	1
alter	1
or	1
cancel	1
them;	1
but	1
still	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
forget	1
that	1
treaties	1
are	1
made,	1
not	1
by	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
contracting	1
parties,	1
but	1
by	1
both;	1
and	1
consequently,	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
both	1
was	1
essential	1
to	1
their	1
formation	1
at	1
first,	1
so	1
must	1
it	1
ever	1
afterwards	1
be	1
to	1
alter	1
or	1
cancel	1
them.	1
The	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
therefore,	1
has	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
extended	1
the	1
obligation	1
of	1
treaties.	1
They	1
are	1
just	1
as	1
binding,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
far	1
beyond	1
the	1
lawful	1
reach	1
of	1
legislative	1
acts	1
now,	1
as	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
at	1
any	1
future	1
period,	1
or	1
under	1
any	1
form	1
of	1
government.	1
However	1
useful	1
jealousy	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
republics,	1
yet	1
when	1
like	1
bile	1
in	1
the	1
natural,	1
it	1
abounds	1
too	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
politic,	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
both	1
become	1
very	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
deceived	1
by	1
the	1
delusive	1
appearances	1
which	1
that	1
malady	1
casts	1
on	1
surrounding	1
objects.	1
From	1
this	1
cause,	1
probably,	1
proceed	1
the	1
fears	1
and	1
apprehensions	1
of	1
some,	1
that	1
the	1
President	1
and	1
Senate	1
may	1
make	1
treaties	1
without	1
an	1
equal	1
eye	1
to	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
States.	1
Others	1
suspect	1
that	1
two	1
thirds	1
will	1
oppress	1
the	1
remaining	1
third,	1
and	1
ask	1
whether	1
those	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
made	1
sufficiently	1
responsible	1
for	1
their	1
conduct;	1
whether,	1
if	1
they	1
act	1
corruptly,	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
punished;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
make	1
disadvantageous	1
treaties,	1
how	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
those	1
treaties?	1
As	1
all	1
the	1
States	1
are	1
equally	1
represented	1
in	1
the	1
Senate,	1
and	1
by	1
men	1
the	1
most	1
able	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
willing	1
to	1
promote	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
their	1
constituents,	1
they	1
will	1
all	1
have	1
an	1
equal	1
degree	1
of	1
influence	1
in	1
that	1
body,	1
especially	1
while	1
they	1
continue	1
to	1
be	1
careful	1
in	1
appointing	1
proper	1
persons,	1
and	1
to	1
insist	1
on	1
their	1
punctual	1
attendance.	1
In	1
proportion	1
as	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
assume	1
a	1
national	1
form	1
and	1
a	1
national	1
character,	1
so	1
will	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
be	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
attention,	1
and	1
the	1
government	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
weak	1
one	1
indeed,	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
forget	1
that	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
promoted	1
by	1
advancing	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
parts	1
or	1
members	1
which	1
compose	1
the	1
whole.	1
It	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
and	1
Senate	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
treaties	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
and	1
their	1
families	1
and	1
estates	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
equally	1
bound	1
and	1
affected	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
community;	1
and,	1
having	1
no	1
private	1
interests	1
distinct	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
under	1
no	1
temptations	1
to	1
neglect	1
the	1
latter.	1
As	1
to	1
corruption,	1
the	1
case	1
is	1
not	1
supposable.	1
He	1
must	1
either	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
unfortunate	1
in	1
his	1
intercourse	1
with	1
the	1
world,	1
or	1
possess	1
a	1
heart	1
very	1
susceptible	1
of	1
such	1
impressions,	1
who	1
can	1
think	1
it	1
probable	1
that	1
the	1
President	1
and	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
will	1
ever	1
be	1
capable	1
of	1
such	1
unworthy	1
conduct.	1
The	1
idea	1
is	1
too	1
gross	1
and	1
too	1
invidious	1
to	1
be	1
entertained.	1
But	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case,	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
ever	1
happen,	1
the	1
treaty	1
so	1
obtained	1
from	1
us	1
would,	1
like	1
all	1
other	1
fraudulent	1
contracts,	1
be	1
null	1
and	1
void	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
nations.	1
With	1
respect	1
to	1
their	1
responsibility,	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
conceive	1
how	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
increased.	1
Every	1
consideration	1
that	1
can	1
influence	1
the	1
human	1
mind,	1
such	1
as	1
honor,	1
oaths,	1
reputations,	1
conscience,	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
country,	1
and	1
family	1
affections	1
and	1
attachments,	1
afford	1
security	1
for	1
their	1
fidelity.	1
In	1
short,	1
as	1
the	1
Constitution	1
has	1
taken	1
the	1
utmost	1
care	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
men	1
of	1
talents	1
and	1
integrity,	1
we	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
the	1
treaties	1
they	1
make	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
advantageous	1
as,	1
all	1
circumstances	1
considered,	1
could	1
be	1
made;	1
and	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
punishment	1
and	1
disgrace	1
can	1
operate,	1
that	1
motive	1
to	1
good	1
behavior	1
is	1
amply	1
afforded	1
by	1
the	1
article	1

To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
remaining	1
powers	1
which	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
allots	1
to	1
the	1
Senate,	1
in	1
a	1
distinct	1
capacity,	1
are	1
comprised	1
in	1
their	1
participation	1
with	1
the	1
executive	1
in	1
the	1
appointment	1
to	1
offices,	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
judicial	1
character	1
as	1
a	1
court	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
impeachments.	1
As	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
appointments	1
the	1
executive	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
principal	1
agent,	1
the	1
provisions	1
relating	1
to	1
it	1
will	1
most	1
properly	1
be	1
discussed	1
in	1
the	1
examination	1
of	1
that	1
department.	1
We	1
will,	1
therefore,	1
conclude	1
this	1
head	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
Senate.	1
A	1
well-constituted	1
court	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
impeachments	1
is	1
an	1
object	1
not	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
desired	1
than	1
difficult	1
to	1
be	1
obtained	1
in	1
a	1
government	1
wholly	1
elective.	1
The	1
subjects	1
of	1
its	1
jurisdiction	1
are	1
those	1
offenses	1
which	1
proceed	1
from	1
the	1
misconduct	1
of	1
public	1
men,	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
from	1
the	1
abuse	1
or	1
violation	1
of	1
some	1
public	1
trust.	1
They	1
are	1
of	1
a	1
nature	1
which	1
may	1
with	1
peculiar	1
propriety	1
be	1
denominated	1
POLITICAL,	1
as	1
they	1
relate	1
chiefly	1
to	1
injuries	1
done	1
immediately	1
to	1
the	1
society	1
itself.	1
The	1
prosecution	1
of	1
them,	1
for	1
this	1
reason,	1
will	1
seldom	1
fail	1
to	1
agitate	1
the	1
passions	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
community,	1
and	1
to	1
divide	1
it	1
into	1
parties	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
friendly	1
or	1
inimical	1
to	1
the	1
accused.	1
In	1
many	1
cases	1
it	1
will	1
connect	1
itself	1
with	1
the	1
pre-existing	1
factions,	1
and	1
will	1
enlist	1
all	1
their	1
animosities,	1
partialities,	1
influence,	1
and	1
interest	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
other;	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
there	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
the	1
greatest	1
danger	1
that	1
the	1
decision	1
will	1
be	1
regulated	1
more	1
by	1
the	1
comparative	1
strength	1
of	1
parties,	1
than	1
by	1
the	1
real	1
demonstrations	1
of	1
innocence	1
or	1
guilt.	1
The	1
delicacy	1
and	1
magnitude	1
of	1
a	1
trust	1
which	1
so	1
deeply	1
concerns	1
the	1
political	1
reputation	1
and	1
existence	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
public	1
affairs,	1
speak	1
for	1
themselves.	1
The	1
difficulty	1
of	1
placing	1
it	1
rightly,	1
in	1
a	1
government	1
resting	1
entirely	1
on	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
periodical	1
elections,	1
will	1
as	1
readily	1
be	1
perceived,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
considered	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
conspicuous	1
characters	1
in	1
it	1
will,	1
from	1
that	1
circumstance,	1
be	1
too	1
often	1
the	1
leaders	1
or	1
the	1
tools	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
cunning	1
or	1
the	1
most	1
numerous	1
faction,	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
account,	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
requisite	1
neutrality	1
towards	1
those	1
whose	1
conduct	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
scrutiny.	1
The	1
convention,	1
it	1
appears,	1
thought	1
the	1
Senate	1
the	1
most	1
fit	1
depositary	1
of	1
this	1
important	1
trust.	1
Those	1
who	1
can	1
best	1
discern	1
the	1
intrinsic	1
difficulty	1
of	1
the	1
thing,	1
will	1
be	1
least	1
hasty	1
in	1
condemning	1
that	1
opinion,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
inclined	1
to	1
allow	1
due	1
weight	1
to	1
the	1
arguments	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
have	1
produced	1
it.	1
What,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
asked,	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
institution	1
itself?	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
designed	1
as	1
a	1
method	1
of	1
NATIONAL	1
INQUEST	1
into	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
public	1
men?	1
If	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
it,	1
who	1
can	1
so	1
properly	1
be	1
the	1
inquisitors	1
for	1
the	1
nation	1
as	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
themselves?	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
disputed	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
originating	1
the	1
inquiry,	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
of	1
preferring	1
the	1
impeachment,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
one	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
Will	1
not	1
the	1
reasons	1
which	1
indicate	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
this	1
arrangement	1
strongly	1
plead	1
for	1
an	1
admission	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
branch	1
of	1
that	1
body	1
to	1
a	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
inquiry?	1
The	1
model	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
this	1
institution	1
has	1
been	1
borrowed,	1
pointed	1
out	1
that	1
course	1
to	1
the	1
convention.	1
In	1
Great	1
Britain	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Commons	1
to	1
prefer	1
the	1
impeachment,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Lords	1
to	1
decide	1
upon	1
it.	1
Several	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
have	1
followed	1
the	1
example.	1
As	1
well	1
the	1
latter,	1
as	1
the	1
former,	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
regarded	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
impeachments	1
as	1
a	1
bridle	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body	1
upon	1
the	1
executive	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
the	1
true	1
light	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
regarded?	1
Where	1
else	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
Senate	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
a	1
tribunal	1
sufficiently	1
dignified,	1
or	1
sufficiently	1
independent?	1
What	1
other	1
body	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
feel	1
CONFIDENCE	1
ENOUGH	1
IN	1
ITS	1
OWN	1
SITUATION,	1
to	1
preserve,	1
unawed	1
and	1
uninfluenced,	1
the	1
necessary	1
impartiality	1
between	1
an	1
INDIVIDUAL	1
accused,	1
and	1
the	1
REPRESENTATIVES	1
OF	1
THE	1
PEOPLE,	1
HIS	1
ACCUSERS?	1
Could	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
have	1
been	1
relied	1
upon	1
as	1
answering	1
this	1
description?	1
It	1
is	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
doubted,	1
whether	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
that	1
tribunal	1
would	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
be	1
endowed	1
with	1
so	1
eminent	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
fortitude,	1
as	1
would	1
be	1
called	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
so	1
difficult	1
a	1
task;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
doubted,	1
whether	1
they	1
would	1
possess	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
credit	1
and	1
authority,	1
which	1
might,	1
on	1
certain	1
occasions,	1
be	1
indispensable	1
towards	1
reconciling	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
a	1
decision	1
that	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
clash	1
with	1
an	1
accusation	1
brought	1
by	1
their	1
immediate	1
representatives.	1
A	1
deficiency	1
in	1
the	1
first,	1
would	1
be	1
fatal	1
to	1
the	1
accused;	1
in	1
the	1
last,	1
dangerous	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
tranquillity.	1
The	1
hazard	1
in	1
both	1
these	1
respects,	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
avoided,	1
if	1
at	1
all,	1
by	1
rendering	1
that	1
tribunal	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
would	1
consist	1
with	1
a	1
reasonable	1
attention	1
to	1
economy.	1
The	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
numerous	1
court	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
impeachments,	1
is	1
equally	1
dictated	1
by	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
proceeding.	1
This	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
tied	1
down	1
by	1
such	1
strict	1
rules,	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
delineation	1
of	1
the	1
offense	1
by	1
the	1
prosecutors,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
judges,	1
as	1
in	1
common	1
cases	1
serve	1
to	1
limit	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
courts	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
personal	1
security.	1
There	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
jury	1
to	1
stand	1
between	1
the	1
judges	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
pronounce	1
the	1
sentence	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
party	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
receive	1
or	1
suffer	1
it.	1
The	1
awful	1
discretion	1
which	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
impeachments	1
must	1
necessarily	1
have,	1
to	1
doom	1
to	1
honor	1
or	1
to	1
infamy	1
the	1
most	1
confidential	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
distinguished	1
characters	1
of	1
the	1
community,	1
forbids	1
the	1
commitment	1
of	1
the	1
trust	1
to	1
a	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
persons.	1
These	1
considerations	1
seem	1
alone	1
sufficient	1
to	1
authorize	1
a	1
conclusion,	1
that	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
improper	1
substitute	1
for	1
the	1
Senate,	1
as	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
impeachments.	1
There	1
remains	1
a	1
further	1
consideration,	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
strengthen	1
this	1
conclusion.	1
It	1
is	1
this:	1
The	1
punishment	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
conviction	1
upon	1
impeachment,	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
terminate	1
the	1
chastisement	1
of	1
the	1
offender.	1
After	1
having	1
been	1
sentenced	1
to	1
a	1
perpetual	1
ostracism	1
from	1
the	1
esteem	1
and	1
confidence,	1
and	1
honors	1
and	1
emoluments	1
of	1
his	1
country,	1
he	1
will	1
still	1
be	1
liable	1
to	1
prosecution	1
and	1
punishment	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
course	1
of	1
law.	1
Would	1
it	1
be	1
proper	1
that	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
had	1
disposed	1
of	1
his	1
fame,	1
and	1
his	1
most	1
valuable	1
rights	1
as	1
a	1
citizen	1
in	1
one	1
trial,	1
should,	1
in	1
another	1
trial,	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
offense,	1
be	1
also	1
the	1
disposers	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
his	1
fortune?	1
Would	1
there	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
greatest	1
reason	1
to	1
apprehend,	1
that	1
error,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
sentence,	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
parent	1
of	1
error	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
sentence?	1
That	1
the	1
strong	1
bias	1
of	1
one	1
decision	1
would	1
be	1
apt	1
to	1
overrule	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
any	1
new	1
lights	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
vary	1
the	1
complexion	1
of	1
another	1
decision?	1
Those	1
who	1
know	1
anything	1
of	1
human	1
nature,	1
will	1
not	1
hesitate	1
to	1
answer	1
these	1
questions	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative;	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
at	1
no	1
loss	1
to	1
perceive,	1
that	1
by	1
making	1
the	1
same	1
persons	1
judges	1
in	1
both	1
cases,	1
those	1
who	1
might	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
prosecution	1
would,	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure,	1
be	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
double	1
security	1
intended	1
them	1
by	1
a	1
double	1
trial.	1
The	1
loss	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
estate	1
would	1
often	1
be	1
virtually	1
included	1
in	1
a	1
sentence	1
which,	1
in	1
its	1
terms,	1
imported	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
dismission	1
from	1
a	1
present,	1
and	1
disqualification	1
for	1
a	1
future,	1
office.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
said,	1
that	1
the	1
intervention	1
of	1
a	1
jury,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
instance,	1
would	1
obviate	1
the	1
danger.	1
But	1
juries	1
are	1
frequently	1
influenced	1
by	1
the	1
opinions	1
of	1
judges.	1
They	1
are	1
sometimes	1
induced	1
to	1
find	1
special	1
verdicts,	1
which	1
refer	1
the	1
main	1
question	1
to	1
the	1
decision	1
of	1
the	1
court.	1
Who	1
would	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
stake	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
his	1
estate	1
upon	1
the	1
verdict	1
of	1
a	1
jury	1
acting	1
under	1
the	1
auspices	1
of	1
judges	1
who	1
had	1
predetermined	1
his	1
guilt?	1
Would	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
improvement	1
of	1
the	1
plan,	1
to	1
have	1
united	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
with	1
the	1
Senate,	1
in	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
impeachments?	1
This	1
union	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
been	1
attended	1
with	1
several	1
advantages;	1
but	1
would	1
they	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
overbalanced	1
by	1
the	1
signal	1
disadvantage,	1
already	1
stated,	1
arising	1
from	1
the	1
agency	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
judges	1
in	1
the	1
double	1
prosecution	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
offender	1
would	1
be	1
liable?	1
To	1
a	1
certain	1
extent,	1
the	1
benefits	1
of	1
that	1
union	1
will	1
be	1
obtained	1
from	1
making	1
the	1
chief	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
the	1
president	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
impeachments,	1
as	1
is	1
proposed	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention;	1
while	1
the	1
inconveniences	1
of	1
an	1
entire	1
incorporation	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
into	1
the	1
latter	1
will	1
be	1
substantially	1
avoided.	1
This	1
was	1
perhaps	1
the	1
prudent	1
mean.	1
I	1
forbear	1
to	1
remark	1
upon	1
the	1
additional	1
pretext	1
for	1
clamor	1
against	1
the	1
judiciary,	1
which	1
so	1
considerable	1
an	1
augmentation	1
of	1
its	1
authority	1
would	1
have	1
afforded.	1
Would	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
desirable	1
to	1
have	1
composed	1
the	1
court	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
impeachments,	1
of	1
persons	1
wholly	1
distinct	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
departments	1
of	1
the	1
government?	1
There	1
are	1
weighty	1
arguments,	1
as	1
well	1
against,	1
as	1
in	1
favor	1
of,	1
such	1
a	1
plan.	1
To	1
some	1
minds	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
appear	1
a	1
trivial	1
objection,	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
tend	1
to	1
increase	1
the	1
complexity	1
of	1
the	1
political	1
machine,	1
and	1
to	1
add	1
a	1
new	1
spring	1
to	1
the	1
government,	1
the	1
utility	1
of	1
which	1
would	1
at	1
best	1
be	1
questionable.	1
But	1
an	1
objection	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
thought	1
by	1
any	1
unworthy	1
of	1
attention,	1
is	1
this:	1
a	1
court	1
formed	1
upon	1
such	1
a	1
plan,	1
would	1
either	1
be	1
attended	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
expense,	1
or	1
might	1
in	1
practice	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
casualties	1
and	1
inconveniences.	1
It	1
must	1
either	1
consist	1
of	1
permanent	1
officers,	1
stationary	1
at	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
government,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
entitled	1
to	1
fixed	1
and	1
regular	1
stipends,	1
or	1
of	1
certain	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
upon	1
whenever	1
an	1
impeachment	1
was	1
actually	1
depending.	1
It	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
easy	1
to	1
imagine	1
any	1
third	1
mode	1
materially	1
different,	1
which	1
could	1
rationally	1
be	1
proposed.	1
As	1
the	1
court,	1
for	1
reasons	1
already	1
given,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
numerous,	1
the	1
first	1
scheme	1
will	1
be	1
reprobated	1
by	1
every	1
man	1
who	1
can	1
compare	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
wants	1
with	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
supplying	1
them.	1
The	1
second	1
will	1
be	1
espoused	1
with	1
caution	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
will	1
seriously	1
consider	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
collecting	1
men	1
dispersed	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
Union;	1
the	1
injury	1
to	1
the	1
innocent,	1
from	1
the	1
procrastinated	1
determination	1
of	1
the	1
charges	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
brought	1
against	1
them;	1
the	1
advantage	1
to	1
the	1
guilty,	1
from	1
the	1
opportunities	1
which	1
delay	1
would	1
afford	1
to	1
intrigue	1
and	1
corruption;	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
the	1
detriment	1
to	1
the	1
State,	1
from	1
the	1
prolonged	1
inaction	1
of	1
men	1
whose	1
firm	1
and	1
faithful	1
execution	1
of	1
their	1
duty	1
might	1
have	1
exposed	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
persecution	1
of	1
an	1
intemperate	1
or	1
designing	1
majority	1
in	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives.	1
Though	1
this	1
latter	1
supposition	1
may	1
seem	1
harsh,	1
and	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
likely	1
often	1
to	1
be	1
verified,	1
yet	1
it	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
forgotten	1
that	1
the	1
demon	1
of	1
faction	1
will,	1
at	1
certain	1
seasons,	1
extend	1
his	1
sceptre	1
over	1
all	1
numerous	1
bodies	1
of	1
men.	1
But	1
though	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
substitutes	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
examined,	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
devised,	1
should	1
be	1
thought	1
preferable	1
to	1
the	1
plan	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
reported	1
by	1
the	1
convention,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
follow	1
that	1
the	1
Constitution	1
ought	1
for	1
this	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
rejected.	1
If	1
mankind	1
were	1
to	1
resolve	1
to	1
agree	1
in	1
no	1
institution	1
of	1
government,	1
until	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
adjusted	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
exact	1
standard	1
of	1
perfection,	1
society	1
would	1
soon	1
become	1
a	1
general	1
scene	1
of	1
anarchy,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
a	1
desert.	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
perfection	1
to	1
be	1
found?	1
Who	1
will	1
undertake	1
to	1
unite	1
the	1
discordant	1
opinions	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
community,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
judgment	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
to	1
prevail	1
upon	1
one	1
conceited	1
projector	1
to	1
renounce	1
his	1
INFALLIBLE	1
criterion	1

To	1

the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
A	1
REVIEW	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
objections	1
that	1
have	1
appeared	1
against	1
the	1
proposed	1
court	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
impeachments,	1
will	1
not	1
improbably	1
eradicate	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
any	1
unfavorable	1
impressions	1
which	1
may	1
still	1
exist	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
matter.	1
The	1
FIRST	1
of	1
these	1
objections	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
provision	1
in	1
question	1
confounds	1
legislative	1
and	1
judiciary	1
authorities	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
body,	1
in	1
violation	1
of	1
that	1
important	1
and	1
wellestablished	1
maxim	1
which	1
requires	1
a	1
separation	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
departments	1
of	1
power.	1
The	1
true	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
maxim	1
has	1
been	1
discussed	1
and	1
ascertained	1
in	1
another	1
place,	1
and	1
has	1
been	1
shown	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
compatible	1
with	1
a	1
partial	1
intermixture	1
of	1
those	1
departments	1
for	1
special	1
purposes,	1
preserving	1
them,	1
in	1
the	1
main,	1
distinct	1
and	1
unconnected.	1
This	1
partial	1
intermixture	1
is	1
even,	1
in	1
some	1
cases,	1
not	1
only	1
proper	1
but	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
mutual	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
against	1
each	1
other.	1
An	1
absolute	1
or	1
qualified	1
negative	1
in	1
the	1
executive	1
upon	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body,	1
is	1
admitted,	1
by	1
the	1
ablest	1
adepts	1
in	1
political	1
science,	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
indispensable	1
barrier	1
against	1
the	1
encroachments	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
upon	1
the	1
former.	1
And	1
it	1
may,	1
perhaps,	1
with	1
no	1
less	1
reason	1
be	1
contended,	1
that	1
the	1
powers	1
relating	1
to	1
impeachments	1
are,	1
as	1
before	1
intimated,	1
an	1
essential	1
check	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
that	1
body	1
upon	1
the	1
encroachments	1
of	1
the	1
executive.	1
The	1
division	1
of	1
them	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
assigning	1
to	1
one	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
accusing,	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
judging,	1
avoids	1
the	1
inconvenience	1
of	1
making	1
the	1
same	1
persons	1
both	1
accusers	1
and	1
judges;	1
and	1
guards	1
against	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
persecution,	1
from	1
the	1
prevalency	1
of	1
a	1
factious	1
spirit	1
in	1
either	1
of	1
those	1
branches.	1
As	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
will	1
be	1
requisite	1
to	1
a	1
condemnation,	1
the	1
security	1
to	1
innocence,	1
from	1
this	1
additional	1
circumstance,	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
complete	1
as	1
itself	1
can	1
desire.	1
It	1
is	1
curious	1
to	1
observe,	1
with	1
what	1
vehemence	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
is	1
assailed,	1
on	1
the	1
principle	1
here	1
taken	1
notice	1
of,	1
by	1
men	1
who	1
profess	1
to	1
admire,	1
without	1
exception,	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
this	1
State;	1
while	1
that	1
constitution	1
makes	1
the	1
Senate,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
chancellor	1
and	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court,	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
impeachments,	1
but	1
the	1
highest	1
judicatory	1
in	1
the	1
State,	1
in	1
all	1
causes,	1
civil	1
and	1
criminal.	1
The	1
proportion,	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
numbers,	1
of	1
the	1
chancellor	1
and	1
judges	1
to	1
the	1
senators,	1
is	1
so	1
inconsiderable,	1
that	1
the	1
judiciary	1
authority	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
resort,	1
may,	1
with	1
truth,	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
reside	1
in	1
its	1
Senate.	1
If	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
be,	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
chargeable	1
with	1
a	1
departure	1
from	1
the	1
celebrated	1
maxim	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
often	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
little	1
understood,	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
culpable	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
New	1
York?1	1
A	1
SECOND	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
Senate,	1
as	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
impeachments,	1
is,	1
that	1
it	1
contributes	1
to	1
an	1
undue	1
accumulation	1
of	1
power	1
in	1
that	1
body,	1
tending	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
a	1
countenance	1
too	1
aristocratic.	1
The	1
Senate,	1
it	1
is	1
observed,	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
concurrent	1
authority	1
with	1
the	1
Executive	1
in	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
treaties	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
appointment	1
to	1
offices:	1
if,	1
say	1
the	1
objectors,	1
to	1
these	1
prerogatives	1
is	1
added	1
that	1
of	1
deciding	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
of	1
impeachment,	1
it	1
will	1
give	1
a	1
decided	1
predominancy	1
to	1
senatorial	1
influence.	1
To	1
an	1
objection	1
so	1
little	1
precise	1
in	1
itself,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
very	1
precise	1
answer.	1
Where	1
is	1
the	1
measure	1
or	1
criterion	1
to	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
appeal,	1
for	1
determining	1
what	1
will	1
give	1
the	1
Senate	1
too	1
much,	1
too	1
little,	1
or	1
barely	1
the	1
proper	1
degree	1
of	1
influence?	1
Will	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
more	1
safe,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
more	1
simple,	1
to	1
dismiss	1
such	1
vague	1
and	1
uncertain	1
calculations,	1
to	1
examine	1
each	1
power	1
by	1
itself,	1
and	1
to	1
decide,	1
on	1
general	1
principles,	1
where	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
deposited	1
with	1
most	1
advantage	1
and	1
least	1
inconvenience?	1
If	1
we	1
take	1
this	1
course,	1
it	1
will	1
lead	1
to	1
a	1
more	1
intelligible,	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
a	1
more	1
certain	1
result.	1
The	1
disposition	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties,	1
which	1
has	1
obtained	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
will,	1
then,	1
if	1
I	1
mistake	1
not,	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
fully	1
justified	1
by	1
the	1
considerations	1
stated	1
in	1
a	1
former	1
number,	1
and	1
by	1
others	1
which	1
will	1
occur	1
under	1
the	1
next	1
head	1
of	1
our	1
inquiries.	1
The	1
expediency	1
of	1
the	1
junction	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
with	1
the	1
Executive,	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
appointing	1
to	1
offices,	1
will,	1
I	1
trust,	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
a	1
light	1
not	1
less	1
satisfactory,	1
in	1
the	1
disquisitions	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
head.	1
And	1
I	1
flatter	1
myself	1
the	1
observations	1
in	1
my	1
last	1
paper	1
must	1
have	1
gone	1
no	1
inconsiderable	1
way	1
towards	1
proving	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
easy,	1
if	1
practicable,	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
more	1
fit	1
receptacle	1
for	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
determining	1
impeachments,	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
chosen.	1
If	1
this	1
be	1
truly	1
the	1
case,	1
the	1
hypothetical	1
dread	1
of	1
the	1
too	1
great	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
discarded	1
from	1
our	1
reasonings.	1
But	1
this	1
hypothesis,	1
such	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
has	1
already	1
been	1
refuted	1
in	1
the	1
remarks	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
duration	1
in	1
office	1
prescribed	1
for	1
the	1
senators.	1
It	1
was	1
by	1
them	1
shown,	1
as	1
well	1
on	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
historical	1
examples,	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
thing,	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
POPULAR	1
branch	1
of	1
every	1
government,	1
partaking	1
of	1
the	1
republican	1
genius,	1
by	1
being	1
generally	1
the	1
favorite	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
generally	1
a	1
full	1
match,	1
if	1
not	1
an	1
overmatch,	1
for	1
every	1
other	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Government.	1
But	1
independent	1
of	1
this	1
most	1
active	1
and	1
operative	1
principle,	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
equilibrium	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
has	1
provided	1
in	1
its	1
favor	1
several	1
important	1
counterpoises	1
to	1
the	1
additional	1
authorities	1
to	1
be	1
conferred	1
upon	1
the	1
Senate.	1
The	1
exclusive	1
privilege	1
of	1
originating	1
money	1
bills	1
will	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives.	1
The	1
same	1
house	1
will	1
possess	1
the	1
sole	1
right	1
of	1
instituting	1
impeachments:	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
a	1
complete	1
counterbalance	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
determining	1
them?	1
The	1
same	1
house	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
umpire	1
in	1
all	1
elections	1
of	1
the	1
President,	1
which	1
do	1
not	1
unite	1
the	1
suffrages	1
of	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
number	1
of	1
electors;	1
a	1
case	1
which	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
doubted	1
will	1
sometimes,	1
if	1
not	1
frequently,	1
happen.	1
The	1
constant	1
possibility	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
fruitful	1
source	1
of	1
influence	1
to	1
that	1
body.	1
The	1
more	1
it	1
is	1
contemplated,	1
the	1
more	1
important	1
will	1
appear	1
this	1
ultimate	1
though	1
contingent	1
power,	1
of	1
deciding	1
the	1
competitions	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
illustrious	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
office	1
in	1
it.	1
It	1
would	1
not	1
perhaps	1
be	1
rash	1
to	1
predict,	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
mean	1
of	1
influence	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
to	1
outweigh	1
all	1
the	1
peculiar	1
attributes	1
of	1
the	1
Senate.	1
A	1
THIRD	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
Senate	1
as	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
impeachments,	1
is	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
agency	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
appointments	1
to	1
office.	1
It	1
is	1
imagined	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
indulgent	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
men,	1
in	1
whose	1
official	1
creation	1
they	1
had	1
participated.	1
The	1
principle	1
of	1
this	1
objection	1
would	1
condemn	1
a	1
practice,	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
if	1
not	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
governments	1
with	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
acquainted:	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
of	1
rendering	1
those	1
who	1
hold	1
offices	1
during	1
pleasure,	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
appoint	1
them.	1
With	1
equal	1
plausibility	1
might	1
it	1
be	1
alleged	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
that	1
the	1
favoritism	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
an	1
asylum	1
for	1
the	1
misbehavior	1
of	1
the	1
former.	1
But	1
that	1
practice,	1
in	1
contradiction	1
to	1
this	1
principle,	1
proceeds	1
upon	1
the	1
presumption,	1
that	1
the	1
responsibility	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
appoint,	1
for	1
the	1
fitness	1
and	1
competency	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
on	1
whom	1
they	1
bestow	1
their	1
choice,	1
and	1
the	1
interest	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
respectable	1
and	1
prosperous	1
administration	1
of	1
affairs,	1
will	1
inspire	1
a	1
sufficient	1
disposition	1
to	1
dismiss	1
from	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
it	1
all	1
such	1
who,	1
by	1
their	1
conduct,	1
shall	1
have	1
proved	1
themselves	1
unworthy	1
of	1
the	1
confidence	1
reposed	1
in	1
them.	1
Though	1
facts	1
may	1
not	1
always	1
correspond	1
with	1
this	1
presumption,	1
yet	1
if	1
it	1
be,	1
in	1
the	1
main,	1
just,	1
it	1
must	1
destroy	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
the	1
Senate,	1
who	1
will	1
merely	1
sanction	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
Executive,	1
should	1
feel	1
a	1
bias,	1
towards	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
that	1
choice,	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
blind	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
evidences	1
of	1
guilt	1
so	1
extraordinary,	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
induced	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
to	1
become	1
its	1
accusers.	1
If	1
any	1
further	1
arguments	1
were	1
necessary	1
to	1
evince	1
the	1
improbability	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
bias,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
agency	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
appointments.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
to	1
NOMINATE,	1
and,	1
with	1
the	1
advice	1
and	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
to	1
APPOINT.	1
There	1
will,	1
of	1
course,	1
be	1
no	1
exertion	1
of	1
CHOICE	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Senate.	1
They	1
may	1
defeat	1
one	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
Executive,	1
and	1
oblige	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
another;	1
but	1
they	1
cannot	1
themselves	1
CHOOSE,	1
they	1
can	1
only	1
ratify	1
or	1
reject	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
President.	1
They	1
might	1
even	1
entertain	1
a	1
preference	1
to	1
some	1
other	1
person,	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
they	1
were	1
assenting	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
proposed,	1
because	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
no	1
positive	1
ground	1
of	1
opposition	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
sure,	1
if	1
they	1
withheld	1
their	1
assent,	1
that	1
the	1
subsequent	1
nomination	1
would	1
fall	1
upon	1
their	1
own	1
favorite,	1
or	1
upon	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
in	1
their	1
estimation	1
more	1
meritorious	1
than	1
the	1
one	1
rejected.	1
Thus	1
it	1
could	1
hardly	1
happen,	1
that	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
would	1
feel	1
any	1
other	1
complacency	1
towards	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
an	1
appointment	1
than	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
appearances	1
of	1
merit	1
might	1
inspire,	1
and	1
the	1
proofs	1
of	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
it	1
destroy.	1
A	1
FOURTH	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
Senate	1
in	1
the	1
capacity	1
of	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
impeachments,	1
is	1
derived	1
from	1
its	1
union	1
with	1
the	1
Executive	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties.	1
This,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
would	1
constitute	1
the	1
senators	1
their	1
own	1
judges,	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
of	1
a	1
corrupt	1
or	1
perfidious	1
execution	1
of	1
that	1
trust.	1
After	1
having	1
combined	1
with	1
the	1
Executive	1
in	1
betraying	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
in	1
a	1
ruinous	1
treaty,	1
what	1
prospect,	1
it	1
is	1
asked,	1
would	1
there	1
be	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
made	1
to	1
suffer	1
the	1
punishment	1
they	1
would	1
deserve,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
themselves	1
to	1
decide	1
upon	1
the	1
accusation	1
brought	1
against	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
treachery	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
guilty?	1
This	1
objection	1
has	1
been	1
circulated	1
with	1
more	1
earnestness	1
and	1
with	1
greater	1
show	1
of	1
reason	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
which	1
has	1
appeared	1
against	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
plan;	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
deceived	1
if	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
rest	1
upon	1
an	1
erroneous	1
foundation.	1
The	1
security	1
essentially	1
intended	1
by	1
the	1
Constitution	1
against	1
corruption	1
and	1
treachery	1
in	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
treaties,	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
sought	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
numbers	1
and	1
characters	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
make	1
them.	1
The	1
JOINT	1
AGENCY	1
of	1
the	1
Chief	1
Magistrate	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
of	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
a	1
body	1
selected	1
by	1
the	1
collective	1
wisdom	1
of	1
the	1
legislatures	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
is	1
designed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
pledge	1
for	1
the	1
fidelity	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
councils	1
in	1
this	1
particular.	1
The	1
convention	1
might	1
with	1
propriety	1
have	1
meditated	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
the	1
Executive,	1
for	1
a	1
deviation	1
from	1
the	1
instructions	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
or	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
integrity	1
in	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
negotiations	1
committed	1
to	1
him;	1
they	1
might	1
also	1
have	1
had	1
in	1
view	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
leading	1
individuals	1
in	1
the	1
Senate,	1
who	1
should	1
have	1
prostituted	1
their	1
influence	1
in	1
that	1
body	1
as	1
the	1
mercenary	1
instruments	1
of	1
foreign	1
corruption:	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not,	1
with	1
more	1
or	1
with	1
equal	1
propriety,	1
have	1
contemplated	1
the	1
impeachment	1
and	1
punishment	1
of	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
consenting	1
to	1
an	1
improper	1
treaty,	1
than	1
of	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
that	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
legislature,	1
consenting	1
to	1
a	1
pernicious	1
or	1
unconstitutional	1
law,	1
a	1
principle	1
which,	1
I	1
believe,	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
admitted	1
into	1
any	1
government.	1
How,	1
in	1
fact,	1
could	1
a	1
majority	1
in	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
impeach	1
themselves?	1
Not	1
better,	1
it	1
is	1
evident,	1
than	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
might	1
try	1
themselves.	1
And	1
yet	1
what	1
reason	1
is	1
there,	1
that	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
sacrificing	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
by	1
an	1
unjust	1
and	1
tyrannical	1
act	1
of	1
legislation,	1
should	1
escape	1
with	1
impunity,	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
sacrificing	1
the	1
same	1
interests	1
in	1
an	1
injurious	1
treaty	1
with	1
a	1
foreign	1
power?	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
such	1
cases	1
it	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
freedom	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
necessary	1
independence	1
of	1
the	1
deliberations	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
that	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
exempt	1
from	1
punishment	1
for	1
acts	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
collective	1
capacity;	1
and	1
the	1
security	1
to	1
the	1
society	1
must	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
care	1
which	1
is	1
taken	1
to	1
confide	1
the	1
trust	1
to	1
proper	1
hands,	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
their	1
interest	1
to	1
execute	1
it	1
with	1
fidelity,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
as	1
difficult	1
as	1
possible	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
combine	1
in	1
any	1
interest	1
opposite	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
good.	1
So	1
far	1
as	1
might	1
concern	1
the	1
misbehavior	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
in	1
perverting	1
the	1
instructions	1
or	1
contravening	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
apprehensive	1
of	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
disposition	1
in	1
that	1
body	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
abuse	1
of	1
their	1
confidence	1
or	1
to	1
vindicate	1
their	1
own	1
authority.	1
We	1
may	1
thus	1
far	1
count	1
upon	1
their	1
pride,	1
if	1
not	1
upon	1
their	1
virtue.	1
And	1
so	1
far	1
even	1
as	1
might	1
concern	1
the	1
corruption	1
of	1
leading	1
members,	1
by	1
whose	1
arts	1
and	1
influence	1
the	1
majority	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
inveigled	1
into	1
measures	1
odious	1
to	1
the	1
community,	1
if	1
the	1
proofs	1
of	1
that	1
corruption	1
should	1
be	1
satisfactory,	1
the	1
usual	1
propensity	1
of	1
human	1
nature	1
will	1
warrant	1
us	1
in	1
concluding	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
commonly	1
no	1
defect	1
of	1
inclination	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
divert	1
the	1
public	1
resentment	1
from	1
themselves	1
by	1
a	1
ready	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
their	1
mismanagement	1
and	1
disgrace.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
department	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
government,	1
claims	1
next	1
our	1
attention.	1
There	1
is	1
hardly	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
system	1
which	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
attended	1
with	1
greater	1
difficulty	1
in	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
it	1
than	1
this;	1
and	1
there	1
is,	1
perhaps,	1
none	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
inveighed	1
against	1
with	1
less	1
candor	1
or	1
criticised	1
with	1
less	1
judgment.	1
Here	1
the	1
writers	1
against	1
the	1
Constitution	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
pains	1
to	1
signalize	1
their	1
talent	1
of	1
misrepresentation.	1
Calculating	1
upon	1
the	1
aversion	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
monarchy,	1
they	1
have	1
endeavored	1
to	1
enlist	1
all	1
their	1
jealousies	1
and	1
apprehensions	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
intended	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States;	1
not	1
merely	1
as	1
the	1
embryo,	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
full-grown	1
progeny,	1
of	1
that	1
detested	1
parent.	1
To	1
establish	1
the	1
pretended	1
affinity,	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
scrupled	1
to	1
draw	1
resources	1
even	1
from	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
fiction.	1
The	1
authorities	1
of	1
a	1
magistrate,	1
in	1
few	1
instances	1
greater,	1
in	1
some	1
instances	1
less,	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
governor	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
have	1
been	1
magnified	1
into	1
more	1
than	1
royal	1
prerogatives.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
decorated	1
with	1
attributes	1
superior	1
in	1
dignity	1
and	1
splendor	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
shown	1
to	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
diadem	1
sparkling	1
on	1
his	1
brow	1
and	1
the	1
imperial	1
purple	1
flowing	1
in	1
his	1
train.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
seated	1
on	1
a	1
throne	1
surrounded	1
with	1
minions	1
and	1
mistresses,	1
giving	1
audience	1
to	1
the	1
envoys	1
of	1
foreign	1
potentates,	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
supercilious	1
pomp	1
of	1
majesty.	1
The	1
images	1
of	1
Asiatic	1
despotism	1
and	1
voluptuousness	1
have	1
scarcely	1
been	1
wanting	1
to	1
crown	1
the	1
exaggerated	1
scene.	1
We	1
have	1
been	1
taught	1
to	1
tremble	1
at	1
the	1
terrific	1
visages	1
of	1
murdering	1
janizaries,	1
and	1
to	1
blush	1
at	1
the	1
unveiled	1
mysteries	1
of	1
a	1
future	1
seraglio.	1
Attempts	1
so	1
extravagant	1
as	1
these	1
to	1
disfigure	1
or,	1
it	1
might	1
rather	1
be	1
said,	1
to	1
metamorphose	1
the	1
object,	1
render	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
take	1
an	1
accurate	1
view	1
of	1
its	1
real	1
nature	1
and	1
form:	1
in	1
order	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
ascertain	1
its	1
true	1
aspect	1
and	1
genuine	1
appearance,	1
as	1
to	1
unmask	1
the	1
disingenuity	1
and	1
expose	1
the	1
fallacy	1
of	1
the	1
counterfeit	1
resemblances	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
insidiously,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
industriously,	1
propagated.	1
In	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
this	1
task,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
man	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
find	1
it	1
an	1
arduous	1
effort	1
either	1
to	1
behold	1
with	1
moderation,	1
or	1
to	1
treat	1
with	1
seriousness,	1
the	1
devices,	1
not	1
less	1
weak	1
than	1
wicked,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
contrived	1
to	1
pervert	1
the	1
public	1
opinion	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
subject.	1
They	1
so	1
far	1
exceed	1
the	1
usual	1
though	1
unjustifiable	1
licenses	1
of	1
party	1
artifice,	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
a	1
disposition	1
the	1
most	1
candid	1
and	1
tolerant,	1
they	1
must	1
force	1
the	1
sentiments	1
which	1
favor	1
an	1
indulgent	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
political	1
adversaries	1
to	1
give	1
place	1
to	1
a	1
voluntary	1
and	1
unreserved	1
indignation.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
bestow	1
the	1
imputation	1
of	1
deliberate	1
imposture	1
and	1
deception	1
upon	1
the	1
gross	1
pretense	1
of	1
a	1
similitude	1
between	1
a	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
and	1
a	1
magistrate	1
of	1
the	1
character	1
marked	1
out	1
for	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
It	1
is	1
still	1
more	1
impossible	1
to	1
withhold	1
that	1
imputation	1
from	1
the	1
rash	1
and	1
barefaced	1
expedients	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
employed	1
to	1
give	1
success	1
to	1
the	1
attempted	1
imposition.	1
In	1
one	1
instance,	1
which	1
I	1
cite	1
as	1
a	1
sample	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
spirit,	1
the	1
temerity	1
has	1
proceeded	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
ascribe	1
to	1
the	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
a	1
power	1
which	1
by	1
the	1
instrument	1
reported	1
is	1
EXPRESSLY	1
allotted	1
to	1
the	1
Executives	1
of	1
the	1
individual	1
States.	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
filling	1
casual	1
vacancies	1
in	1
the	1
Senate.	1
This	1
bold	1
experiment	1
upon	1
the	1
discernment	1
of	1
his	1
countrymen	1
has	1
been	1
hazarded	1
by	1
a	1
writer	1
who	1
(whatever	1
may	1
be	1
his	1
real	1
merit)	1
has	1
had	1
no	1
inconsiderable	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
applauses	1
of	1
his	1
party1;	1
and	1
who,	1
upon	1
this	1
false	1
and	1
unfounded	1
suggestion,	1
has	1
built	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
observations	1
equally	1
false	1
and	1
unfounded.	1
Let	1
him	1
now	1
be	1
confronted	1
with	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
fact,	1
and	1
let	1
him,	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
able,	1
justify	1
or	1
extenuate	1
the	1
shameful	1
outrage	1
he	1
has	1
offered	1
to	1
the	1
dictates	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
fair	1
dealing.	1
The	1
second	1
clause	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
article	1
empowers	1
the	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
"to	1
nominate,	1
and	1
by	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
advice	1
and	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
to	1
appoint	1
ambassadors,	1
other	1
public	1
ministers	1
and	1
consuls,	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court,	1
and	1
all	1
other	1
OFFICERS	1
of	1
United	1
States	1
whose	1
appointments	1
are	1
NOT	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution	1
OTHERWISE	1
PROVIDED	1
FOR,	1
and	1
WHICH	1
SHALL	1
BE	1
ESTABLISHED	1
BY	1
LAW."	1
Immediately	1
after	1
this	1
clause	1
follows	1
another	1
in	1
these	1
words:	1
"The	1
President	1
shall	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
fill	1
up	1
??	1
VACANCIES	1
that	1
may	1
happen	1
DURING	1
THE	1
RECESS	1
OF	1
THE	1
SENATE,	1
by	1
granting	1
commissions	1
which	1
shall	1
EXPIRE	1
AT	1
THE	1
END	1
OF	1
THEIR	1
NEXT	1
SESSION."	1
It	1
is	1
from	1
this	1
last	1
provision	1
that	1
the	1
pretended	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
to	1
fill	1
vacancies	1
in	1
the	1
Senate	1
has	1
been	1
deduced.	1
A	1
slight	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
connection	1
of	1
the	1
clauses,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
obvious	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
terms,	1
will	1
satisfy	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
deduction	1
is	1
not	1
even	1
colorable.	1
The	1
first	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
clauses,	1
it	1
is	1
clear,	1
only	1
provides	1
a	1
mode	1
for	1
appointing	1
such	1
officers,	1
"whose	1
appointments	1
are	1
NOT	1
OTHERWISE	1
PROVIDED	1
FOR	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
and	1
which	1
SHALL	1
BE	1
ESTABLISHED	1
BY	1
LAW";	1
of	1
course	1
it	1
cannot	1
extend	1
to	1
the	1
appointments	1
of	1
senators,	1
whose	1
appointments	1
are	1
OTHERWISE	1
PROVIDED	1
FOR	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution2,	1
and	1
who	1
are	1
ESTABLISHED	1
BY	1
THE	1
CONSTITUTION,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
require	1
a	1
future	1
establishment	1
by	1
law.	1
This	1
position	1
will	1
hardly	1
be	1
contested.	1
The	1
last	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
clauses,	1
it	1
is	1
equally	1
clear,	1
cannot	1
be	1
understood	1
to	1
comprehend	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
filling	1
vacancies	1
in	1
the	1
Senate,	1
for	1
the	1
following	1
reasons:	1
First.	1
The	1
relation	1
in	1
which	1
that	1
clause	1
stands	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
which	1
declares	1
the	1
general	1
mode	1
of	1
appointing	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
denotes	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
supplement	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
establishing	1
an	1
auxiliary	1
method	1
of	1
appointment,	1
in	1
cases	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
general	1
method	1
was	1
inadequate.	1
The	1
ordinary	1
power	1
of	1
appointment	1
is	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
President	1
and	1
Senate	1
JOINTLY,	1
and	1
can	1
therefore	1
only	1
be	1
exercised	1
during	1
the	1
session	1
of	1
the	1
Senate;	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
improper	1
to	1
oblige	1
this	1
body	1
to	1
be	1
continually	1
in	1
session	1
for	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
officers	1
and	1
as	1
vacancies	1
might	1
happen	1
IN	1
THEIR	1
RECESS,	1
which	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
service	1
to	1
fill	1
without	1
delay,	1
the	1
succeeding	1
clause	1
is	1
evidently	1
intended	1
to	1
authorize	1
the	1
President,	1
SINGLY,	1
to	1
make	1
temporary	1
appointments	1
"during	1
the	1
recess	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
by	1
granting	1
commissions	1
which	1
shall	1
expire	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
next	1
session."	1
Secondly.	1
If	1
this	1
clause	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
supplementary	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
which	1
precedes,	1
the	1
VACANCIES	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
speaks	1
must	1
be	1
construed	1
to	1
relate	1
to	1
the	1
"officers"	1
described	1
in	1
the	1
preceding	1
one;	1
and	1
this,	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
excludes	1
from	1
its	1
description	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Senate.	1
Thirdly.	1
The	1
time	1
within	1
which	1
the	1
power	1
is	1
to	1
operate,	1
"during	1
the	1
recess	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,"	1
and	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
the	1
appointments,	1
"to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
session"	1
of	1
that	1
body,	1
conspire	1
to	1
elucidate	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
provision,	1
which,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
intended	1
to	1
comprehend	1
senators,	1
would	1
naturally	1
have	1
referred	1
the	1
temporary	1
power	1
of	1
filling	1
vacancies	1
to	1
the	1
recess	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
permanent	1
appointments,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
recess	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
Senate,	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
concern	1
in	1
those	1
appointments;	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
extended	1
the	1
duration	1
in	1
office	1
of	1
the	1
temporary	1
senators	1
to	1
the	1
next	1
session	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
of	1
the	1
State,	1
in	1
whose	1
representation	1
the	1
vacancies	1
had	1
happened,	1
instead	1
of	1
making	1
it	1
to	1
expire	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
ensuing	1
session	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
Senate.	1
The	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
authorized	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
permanent	1
appointments	1
would,	1
of	1
course,	1
have	1
governed	1
the	1
modification	1
of	1
a	1
power	1
which	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
temporary	1
appointments;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
national	1
Senate	1
is	1
the	1
body,	1
whose	1
situation	1
is	1
alone	1
contemplated	1
in	1
the	1
clause	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
suggestion	1
under	1
examination	1
has	1
been	1
founded,	1
the	1
vacancies	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
alludes	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
deemed	1
to	1
respect	1
those	1
officers	1
in	1
whose	1
appointment	1
that	1
body	1
has	1
a	1
concurrent	1
agency	1
with	1
the	1
President.	1
But	1
lastly,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
second	1
clauses	1
of	1
the	1
third	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
article,	1
not	1
only	1
obviate	1
all	1
possibility	1
of	1
doubt,	1
but	1
destroy	1
the	1
pretext	1
of	1
misconception.	1
The	1
former	1
provides,	1
that	1
"the	1
Senate	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
shall	1
be	1
composed	1
of	1
two	1
Senators	1
from	1
each	1
State,	1
chosen	1
BY	1
THE	1
LEGISLATURE	1
THEREOF	1
for	1
six	1
years";	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
directs,	1
that,	1
"if	1
vacancies	1
in	1
that	1
body	1
should	1
happen	1
by	1
resignation	1
or	1
otherwise,	1
DURING	1
THE	1
RECESS	1
OF	1
THE	1
LEGISLATURE	1
OF	1
ANY	1
STATE,	1
the	1
Executive	1
THEREOF	1
may	1
make	1
temporary	1
appointments	1
until	1
the	1
NEXT	1
MEETING	1
OF	1
THE	1
LEGISLATURE,	1
which	1
shall	1
then	1
fill	1
such	1
vacancies."	1
Here	1
is	1
an	1
express	1
power	1
given,	1
in	1
clear	1
and	1
unambiguous	1
terms,	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
Executives,	1
to	1
fill	1
casual	1
vacancies	1
in	1
the	1
Senate,	1
by	1
temporary	1
appointments;	1
which	1
not	1
only	1
invalidates	1
the	1
supposition,	1
that	1
the	1
clause	1
before	1
considered	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
intended	1
to	1
confer	1
that	1
power	1
upon	1
the	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
but	1
proves	1
that	1
this	1
supposition,	1
destitute	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
plausibility,	1
must	1
have	1
originated	1
in	1
an	1
intention	1
to	1
deceive	1
the	1
people,	1
too	1
palpable	1
to	1
be	1
obscured	1
by	1
sophistry,	1
too	1
atrocious	1
to	1
be	1
palliated	1
by	1
hypocrisy.	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
pains	1
to	1
select	1
this	1
instance	1
of	1
misrepresentation,	1
and	1
to	1
place	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
clear	1
and	1
strong	1
light,	1
as	1
an	1
unequivocal	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
unwarrantable	1
arts	1
which	1
are	1
practiced	1
to	1
prevent	1
a	1
fair	1
and	1
impartial	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
merits	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
Nor	1
have	1
I	1
scrupled,	1
in	1
so	1
flagrant	1
a	1
case,	1
to	1
allow	1
myself	1
a	1
severity	1
of	1
animadversion	1
little	1
congenial	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
spirit	1
of	1
these	1
papers.	1
I	1
hesitate	1
not	1
to	1
submit	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
decision	1
of	1
any	1
candid	1
and	1
honest	1
adversary	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
government,	1
whether	1
language	1
can	1
furnish	1
epithets	1
of	1
too	1
much	1
asperity,	1
for	1
so	1
shameless	1
and	1
so	1
prostitute	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
impose	1
on	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
America.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
mode	1
of	1
appointment	1
of	1
the	1
Chief	1
Magistrate	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
is	1
almost	1
the	1
only	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
system,	1
of	1
any	1
consequence,	1
which	1
has	1
escaped	1
without	1
severe	1
censure,	1
or	1
which	1
has	1
received	1
the	1
slightest	1
mark	1
of	1
approbation	1
from	1
its	1
opponents.	1
The	1
most	1
plausible	1
of	1
these,	1
who	1
has	1
appeared	1
in	1
print,	1
has	1
even	1
deigned	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
is	1
pretty	1
well	1
guarded.1	1
I	1
venture	1
somewhat	1
further,	1
and	1
hesitate	1
not	1
to	1
affirm,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
perfect,	1
it	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
excellent.	1
It	1
unites	1
in	1
an	1
eminent	1
degree	1
all	1
the	1
advantages,	1
the	1
union	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
wished	1
for.	1
It	1
was	1
desirable	1
that	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
should	1
operate	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
to	1
whom	1
so	1
important	1
a	1
trust	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
confided.	1
This	1
end	1
will	1
be	1
answered	1
by	1
committing	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
making	1
it,	1
not	1
to	1
any	1
preestablished	1
body,	1
but	1
to	1
men	1
chosen	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
the	1
special	1
purpose,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
particular	1
conjuncture.	1
It	1
was	1
equally	1
desirable,	1
that	1
the	1
immediate	1
election	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
by	1
men	1
most	1
capable	1
of	1
analyzing	1
the	1
qualities	1
adapted	1
to	1
the	1
station,	1
and	1
acting	1
under	1
circumstances	1
favorable	1
to	1
deliberation,	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
judicious	1
combination	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
reasons	1
and	1
inducements	1
which	1
were	1
proper	1
to	1
govern	1
their	1
choice.	1
A	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
persons,	1
selected	1
by	1
their	1
fellow-citizens	1
from	1
the	1
general	1
mass,	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
likely	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
information	1
and	1
discernment	1
requisite	1
to	1
such	1
complicated	1
investigations.	1
It	1
was	1
also	1
peculiarly	1
desirable	1
to	1
afford	1
as	1
little	1
opportunity	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
tumult	1
and	1
disorder.	1
This	1
evil	1
was	1
not	1
least	1
to	1
be	1
dreaded	1
in	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
a	1
magistrate,	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
so	1
important	1
an	1
agency	1
in	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
as	1
the	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
But	1
the	1
precautions	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
happily	1
concerted	1
in	1
the	1
system	1
under	1
consideration,	1
promise	1
an	1
effectual	1
security	1
against	1
this	1
mischief.	1
The	1
choice	1
of	1
SEVERAL,	1
to	1
form	1
an	1
intermediate	1
body	1
of	1
electors,	1
will	1
be	1
much	1
less	1
apt	1
to	1
convulse	1
the	1
community	1
with	1
any	1
extraordinary	1
or	1
violent	1
movements,	1
than	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
ONE	1
who	1
was	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
final	1
object	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
wishes.	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
electors,	1
chosen	1
in	1
each	1
State,	1
are	1
to	1
assemble	1
and	1
vote	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
chosen,	1
this	1
detached	1
and	1
divided	1
situation	1
will	1
expose	1
them	1
much	1
less	1
to	1
heats	1
and	1
ferments,	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
communicated	1
from	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
than	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
convened	1
at	1
one	1
time,	1
in	1
one	1
place.	1
Nothing	1
was	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
desired	1
than	1
that	1
every	1
practicable	1
obstacle	1
should	1
be	1
opposed	1
to	1
cabal,	1
intrigue,	1
and	1
corruption.	1
These	1
most	1
deadly	1
adversaries	1
of	1
republican	1
government	1
might	1
naturally	1
have	1
been	1
expected	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
approaches	1
from	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
quarter,	1
but	1
chiefly	1
from	1
the	1
desire	1
in	1
foreign	1
powers	1
to	1
gain	1
an	1
improper	1
ascendant	1
in	1
our	1
councils.	1
How	1
could	1
they	1
better	1
gratify	1
this,	1
than	1
by	1
raising	1
a	1
creature	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
to	1
the	1
chief	1
magistracy	1
of	1
the	1
Union?	1
But	1
the	1
convention	1
have	1
guarded	1
against	1
all	1
danger	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
provident	1
and	1
judicious	1
attention.	1
They	1
have	1
not	1
made	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
to	1
depend	1
on	1
any	1
preexisting	1
bodies	1
of	1
men,	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
tampered	1
with	1
beforehand	1
to	1
prostitute	1
their	1
votes;	1
but	1
they	1
have	1
referred	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance	1
to	1
an	1
immediate	1
act	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America,	1
to	1
be	1
exerted	1
in	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
persons	1
for	1
the	1
temporary	1
and	1
sole	1
purpose	1
of	1
making	1
the	1
appointment.	1
And	1
they	1
have	1
excluded	1
from	1
eligibility	1
to	1
this	1
trust,	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
from	1
situation	1
might	1
be	1
suspected	1
of	1
too	1
great	1
devotion	1
to	1
the	1
President	1
in	1
office.	1
No	1
senator,	1
representative,	1
or	1
other	1
person	1
holding	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
trust	1
or	1
profit	1
under	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
numbers	1
of	1
the	1
electors.	1
Thus	1
without	1
corrupting	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
the	1
immediate	1
agents	1
in	1
the	1
election	1
will	1
at	1
least	1
enter	1
upon	1
the	1
task	1
free	1
from	1
any	1
sinister	1
bias.	1
Their	1
transient	1
existence,	1
and	1
their	1
detached	1
situation,	1
already	1
taken	1
notice	1
of,	1
afford	1
a	1
satisfactory	1
prospect	1
of	1
their	1
continuing	1
so,	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
business	1
of	1
corruption,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
embrace	1
so	1
considerable	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men,	1
requires	1
time	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
means.	1
Nor	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
found	1
easy	1
suddenly	1
to	1
embark	1
them,	1
dispersed	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
over	1
thirteen	1
States,	1
in	1
any	1
combinations	1
founded	1
upon	1
motives,	1
which	1
though	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
properly	1
be	1
denominated	1
corrupt,	1
might	1
yet	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
nature	1
to	1
mislead	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
duty.	1
Another	1
and	1
no	1
less	1
important	1
desideratum	1
was,	1
that	1
the	1
Executive	1
should	1
be	1
independent	1
for	1
his	1
continuance	1
in	1
office	1
on	1
all	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
themselves.	1
He	1
might	1
otherwise	1
be	1
tempted	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
his	1
complaisance	1
for	1
those	1
whose	1
favor	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
his	1
official	1
consequence.	1
This	1
advantage	1
will	1
also	1
be	1
secured,	1
by	1
making	1
his	1
re-election	1
to	1
depend	1
on	1
a	1
special	1
body	1
of	1
representatives,	1
deputed	1
by	1
the	1
society	1
for	1
the	1
single	1
purpose	1
of	1
making	1
the	1
important	1
choice.	1
All	1
these	1
advantages	1
will	1
happily	1
combine	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
devised	1
by	1
the	1
convention;	1
which	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
each	1
State	1
shall	1
choose	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
persons	1
as	1
electors,	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
senators	1
and	1
representatives	1
of	1
such	1
State	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
who	1
shall	1
assemble	1
within	1
the	1
State,	1
and	1
vote	1
for	1
some	1
fit	1
person	1
as	1
President.	1
Their	1
votes,	1
thus	1
given,	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
transmitted	1
to	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
and	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
number	1
of	1
votes	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
President.	1
But	1
as	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
votes	1
might	1
not	1
always	1
happen	1
to	1
centre	1
in	1
one	1
man,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
unsafe	1
to	1
permit	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
majority	1
to	1
be	1
conclusive,	1
it	1
is	1
provided	1
that,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
contingency,	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
shall	1
select	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
candidates	1
who	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
five	1
highest	1
number	1
of	1
votes,	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
in	1
their	1
opinion	1
may	1
be	1
best	1
qualified	1
for	1
the	1
office.	1
The	1
process	1
of	1
election	1
affords	1
a	1
moral	1
certainty,	1
that	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
President	1
will	1
never	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
an	1
eminent	1
degree	1
endowed	1
with	1
the	1
requisite	1
qualifications.	1
Talents	1
for	1
low	1
intrigue,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
arts	1
of	1
popularity,	1
may	1
alone	1
suffice	1
to	1
elevate	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
honors	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
State;	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
require	1
other	1
talents,	1
and	1
a	1
different	1
kind	1
of	1
merit,	1
to	1
establish	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
esteem	1
and	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
Union,	1
or	1
of	1
so	1
considerable	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
successful	1
candidate	1
for	1
the	1
distinguished	1
office	1
of	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
It	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
strong	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
constant	1
probability	1
of	1
seeing	1
the	1
station	1
filled	1
by	1
characters	1
pre-eminent	1
for	1
ability	1
and	1
virtue.	1
And	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
thought	1
no	1
inconsiderable	1
recommendation	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
able	1
to	1
estimate	1
the	1
share	1
which	1
the	1
executive	1
in	1
every	1
government	1
must	1
necessarily	1
have	1
in	1
its	1
good	1
or	1
ill	1
administration.	1
Though	1
we	1
cannot	1
acquiesce	1
in	1
the	1
political	1
heresy	1
of	1
the	1
poet	1
who	1
says:	1
"For	1
forms	1
of	1
government	1
let	1
fools	1
contest	1
That	1
which	1
is	1
best	1
administered	1
is	1
best,"	1
yet	1
we	1
may	1
safely	1
pronounce,	1
that	1
the	1
true	1
test	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
government	1
is	1
its	1
aptitude	1
and	1
tendency	1
to	1
produce	1
a	1
good	1
administration.	1
The	1
Vice-President	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
chosen	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
with	1
the	1
President;	1
with	1
this	1
difference,	1
that	1
the	1
Senate	1
is	1
to	1
do,	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
former,	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
appointment	1
of	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
person,	1
as	1
Vice-President,	1
has	1
been	1
objected	1
to	1
as	1
superfluous,	1
if	1
not	1
mischievous.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
alleged,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
preferable	1
to	1
have	1
authorized	1
the	1
Senate	1
to	1
elect	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
body	1
an	1
officer	1
answering	1
that	1
description.	1
But	1
two	1
considerations	1
seem	1
to	1
justify	1
the	1
ideas	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
in	1
this	1
respect.	1
One	1
is,	1
that	1
to	1
secure	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
a	1
definite	1
resolution	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
President	1
should	1
have	1
only	1
a	1
casting	1
vote.	1
And	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
senator	1
of	1
any	1
State	1
from	1
his	1
seat	1
as	1
senator,	1
to	1
place	1
him	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
exchange,	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
came,	1
a	1
constant	1
for	1
a	1
contingent	1
vote.	1
The	1
other	1
consideration	1
is,	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
Vice-President	1
may	1
occasionally	1
become	1
a	1
substitute	1
for	1
the	1
President,	1
in	1
the	1
supreme	1
executive	1
magistracy,	1
all	1
the	1
reasons	1
which	1
recommend	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
election	1
prescribed	1
for	1
the	1
one,	1
apply	1
with	1
great	1
if	1
not	1
with	1
equal	1
force	1
to	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
appointing	1
the	1
other.	1
It	1
is	1
remarkable	1
that	1
in	1
this,	1
as	1
in	1
most	1
other	1
instances,	1
the	1
objection	1
which	1
is	1
made	1
would	1
lie	1
against	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
this	1
State.	1
We	1
have	1
a	1
Lieutenant-Governor,	1
chosen	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large,	1
who	1
presides	1
in	1
the	1
Senate,	1
and	1
is	1
the	1
constitutional	1
substitute	1
for	1
the	1
Governor,	1
in	1
casualties	1
similar	1
to	1
those	1
which	1
would	1
authorize	1
the	1
Vice-President	1
to	1
exercise	1
the	1
authorities	1
and	1
discharge	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
the	1
President.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
I	1
PROCEED	1
now	1
to	1
trace	1
the	1
real	1
characters	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
Executive,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
marked	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention.	1
This	1
will	1
serve	1
to	1
place	1
in	1
a	1
strong	1
light	1
the	1
unfairness	1
of	1
the	1
representations	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
it.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
which	1
strikes	1
our	1
attention	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
executive	1
authority,	1
with	1
few	1
exceptions,	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
vested	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
magistrate.	1
This	1
will	1
scarcely,	1
however,	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
point	1
upon	1
which	1
any	1
comparison	1
can	1
be	1
grounded;	1
for	1
if,	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
less	1
a	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
Grand	1
Seignior,	1
to	1
the	1
khan	1
of	1
Tartary,	1
to	1
the	1
Man	1
of	1
the	1
Seven	1
Mountains,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
New	1
York.	1
That	1
magistrate	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
elected	1
for	1
FOUR	1
years;	1
and	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
re-eligible	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
shall	1
think	1
him	1
worthy	1
of	1
their	1
confidence.	1
In	1
these	1
circumstances	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
total	1
dissimilitude	1
between	1
HIM	1
and	1
a	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
who	1
is	1
an	1
HEREDITARY	1
monarch,	1
possessing	1
the	1
crown	1
as	1
a	1
patrimony	1
descendible	1
to	1
his	1
heirs	1
forever;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
close	1
analogy	1
between	1
HIM	1
and	1
a	1
governor	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
who	1
is	1
elected	1
for	1
THREE	1
years,	1
and	1
is	1
re-eligible	1
without	1
limitation	1
or	1
intermission.	1
If	1
we	1
consider	1
how	1
much	1
less	1
time	1
would	1
be	1
requisite	1
for	1
establishing	1
a	1
dangerous	1
influence	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
State,	1
than	1
for	1
establishing	1
a	1
like	1
influence	1
throughout	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
we	1
must	1
conclude	1
that	1
a	1
duration	1
of	1
FOUR	1
years	1
for	1
the	1
Chief	1
Magistrate	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
is	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
permanency	1
far	1
less	1
to	1
be	1
dreaded	1
in	1
that	1
office,	1
than	1
a	1
duration	1
of	1
THREE	1
years	1
for	1
a	1
corresponding	1
office	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
State.	1
The	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
would	1
be	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
impeached,	1
tried,	1
and,	1
upon	1
conviction	1
of	1
treason,	1
bribery,	1
or	1
other	1
high	1
crimes	1
or	1
misdemeanors,	1
removed	1
from	1
office;	1
and	1
would	1
afterwards	1
be	1
liable	1
to	1
prosecution	1
and	1
punishment	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
course	1
of	1
law.	1
The	1
person	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
is	1
sacred	1
and	1
inviolable;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
constitutional	1
tribunal	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
amenable;	1
no	1
punishment	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
can	1
be	1
subjected	1
without	1
involving	1
the	1
crisis	1
of	1
a	1
national	1
revolution.	1
In	1
this	1
delicate	1
and	1
important	1
circumstance	1
of	1
personal	1
responsibility,	1
the	1
President	1
of	1
Confederated	1
America	1
would	1
stand	1
upon	1
no	1
better	1
ground	1
than	1
a	1
governor	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
and	1
upon	1
worse	1
ground	1
than	1
the	1
governors	1
of	1
Maryland	1
and	1
Delaware.	1
The	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
return	1
a	1
bill,	1
which	1
shall	1
have	1
passed	1
the	1
two	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
for	1
reconsideration;	1
and	1
the	1
bill	1
so	1
returned	1
is	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
law,	1
if,	1
upon	1
that	1
reconsideration,	1
it	1
be	1
approved	1
by	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
both	1
houses.	1
The	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
on	1
his	1
part,	1
has	1
an	1
absolute	1
negative	1
upon	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
houses	1
of	1
Parliament.	1
The	1
disuse	1
of	1
that	1
power	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
past	1
does	1
not	1
affect	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
its	1
existence;	1
and	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
ascribed	1
wholly	1
to	1
the	1
crown's	1
having	1
found	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
substituting	1
influence	1
to	1
authority,	1
or	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
gaining	1
a	1
majority	1
in	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
houses,	1
to	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
exerting	1
a	1
prerogative	1
which	1
could	1
seldom	1
be	1
exerted	1
without	1
hazarding	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
national	1
agitation.	1
The	1
qualified	1
negative	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
differs	1
widely	1
from	1
this	1
absolute	1
negative	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
sovereign;	1
and	1
tallies	1
exactly	1
with	1
the	1
revisionary	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
of	1
revision	1
of	1
this	1
State,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
governor	1
is	1
a	1
constituent	1
part.	1
In	1
this	1
respect	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
would	1
exceed	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
because	1
the	1
former	1
would	1
possess,	1
singly,	1
what	1
the	1
latter	1
shares	1
with	1
the	1
chancellor	1
and	1
judges;	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
precisely	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
Massachusetts,	1
whose	1
constitution,	1
as	1
to	1
this	1
article,	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
original	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
convention	1
have	1
copied.	1
The	1
President	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
"commander-in-chief	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
navy	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
when	1
called	1
into	1
the	1
actual	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
He	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
grant	1
reprieves	1
and	1
pardons	1
for	1
offenses	1
against	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
EXCEPT	1
IN	1
CASES	1
OF	1
IMPEACHMENT;	1
to	1
recommend	1
to	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
Congress	1
such	1
measures	1
as	1
he	1
shall	1
judge	1
necessary	1
and	1
expedient;	1
to	1
convene,	1
on	1
extraordinary	1
occasions,	1
both	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
or	1
either	1
of	1
them,	1
and,	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
disagreement	1
between	1
them	1
WITH	1
RESPECT	1
TO	1
THE	1
TIME	1
OF	1
ADJOURNMENT,	1
to	1
adjourn	1
them	1
to	1
such	1
time	1
as	1
he	1
shall	1
think	1
proper;	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
the	1
laws	1
be	1
faithfully	1
executed;	1
and	1
to	1
commission	1
all	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States."	1
In	1
most	1
of	1
these	1
particulars,	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
will	1
resemble	1
equally	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
New	1
York.	1
The	1
most	1
material	1
points	1
of	1
difference	1
are	1
these:	1
First.	1
The	1
President	1
will	1
have	1
only	1
the	1
occasional	1
command	1
of	1
such	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
as	1
by	1
legislative	1
provision	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
into	1
the	1
actual	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
The	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
and	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
have	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
the	1
entire	1
command	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
militia	1
within	1
their	1
several	1
jurisdictions.	1
In	1
this	1
article,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
would	1
be	1
inferior	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
either	1
the	1
monarch	1
or	1
the	1
governor.	1
Secondly.	1
The	1
President	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
commander-in-chief	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
navy	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
In	1
this	1
respect	1
his	1
authority	1
would	1
be	1
nominally	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
but	1
in	1
substance	1
much	1
inferior	1
to	1
it.	1
It	1
would	1
amount	1
to	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
supreme	1
command	1
and	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
military	1
and	1
naval	1
forces,	1
as	1
first	1
General	1
and	1
admiral	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy;	1
while	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
king	1
extends	1
to	1
the	1
DECLARING	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
RAISING	1
and	1
REGULATING	1
of	1
fleets	1
and	1
armies,	1
all	1
which,	1
by	1
the	1
Constitution	1
under	1
consideration,	1
would	1
appertain	1
to	1
the	1
legislature.1	1
The	1
governor	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
vested	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
its	1
militia	1
and	1
navy.	1
But	1
the	1
constitutions	1
of	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
expressly	1
declare	1
their	1
governors	1
to	1
be	1
commanders-in-chief,	1
as	1
well	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
as	1
navy;	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
a	1
question,	1
whether	1
those	1
of	1
New	1
Hampshire	1
and	1
Massachusetts,	1
in	1
particular,	1
do	1
not,	1
in	1
this	1
instance,	1
confer	1
larger	1
powers	1
upon	1
their	1
respective	1
governors,	1
than	1
could	1
be	1
claimed	1
by	1
a	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
Thirdly.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
President,	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
pardons,	1
would	1
extend	1
to	1
all	1
cases,	1
EXCEPT	1
THOSE	1
OF	1
IMPEACHMENT.	1
The	1
governor	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
may	1
pardon	1
in	1
all	1
cases,	1
even	1
in	1
those	1
of	1
impeachment,	1
except	1
for	1
treason	1
and	1
murder.	1
Is	1
not	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
governor,	1
in	1
this	1
article,	1
on	1
a	1
calculation	1
of	1
political	1
consequences,	1
greater	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
President?	1
All	1
conspiracies	1
and	1
plots	1
against	1
the	1
government,	1
which	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
matured	1
into	1
actual	1
treason,	1
may	1
be	1
screened	1
from	1
punishment	1
of	1
every	1
kind,	1
by	1
the	1
interposition	1
of	1
the	1
prerogative	1
of	1
pardoning.	1
If	1
a	1
governor	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
therefore,	1
should	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
any	1
such	1
conspiracy,	1
until	1
the	1
design	1
had	1
been	1
ripened	1
into	1
actual	1
hostility	1
he	1
could	1
insure	1
his	1
accomplices	1
and	1
adherents	1
an	1
entire	1
impunity.	1
A	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
even	1
pardon	1
treason,	1
when	1
prosecuted	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
course	1
of	1
law,	1
could	1
shelter	1
no	1
offender,	1
in	1
any	1
degree,	1
from	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
impeachment	1
and	1
conviction.	1
Would	1
not	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
a	1
total	1
indemnity	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
preliminary	1
steps	1
be	1
a	1
greater	1
temptation	1
to	1
undertake	1
and	1
persevere	1
in	1
an	1
enterprise	1
against	1
the	1
public	1
liberty,	1
than	1
the	1
mere	1
prospect	1
of	1
an	1
exemption	1
from	1
death	1
and	1
confiscation,	1
if	1
the	1
final	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
design,	1
upon	1
an	1
actual	1
appeal	1
to	1
arms,	1
should	1
miscarry?	1
Would	1
this	1
last	1
expectation	1
have	1
any	1
influence	1
at	1
all,	1
when	1
the	1
probability	1
was	1
computed,	1
that	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
afford	1
that	1
exemption	1
might	1
himself	1
be	1
involved	1
in	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
the	1
measure,	1
and	1
might	1
be	1
incapacitated	1
by	1
his	1
agency	1
in	1
it	1
from	1
affording	1
the	1
desired	1
impunity?	1
The	1
better	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
this	1
matter,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
recollect,	1
that,	1
by	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
the	1
offense	1
of	1
treason	1
is	1
limited	1
"to	1
levying	1
war	1
upon	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
and	1
adhering	1
to	1
their	1
enemies,	1
giving	1
them	1
aid	1
and	1
comfort";	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
it	1
is	1
confined	1
within	1
similar	1
bounds.	1
Fourthly.	1
The	1
President	1
can	1
only	1
adjourn	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
in	1
the	1
single	1
case	1
of	1
disagreement	1
about	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
adjournment.	1
The	1
British	1
monarch	1
may	1
prorogue	1
or	1
even	1
dissolve	1
the	1
Parliament.	1
The	1
governor	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
may	1
also	1
prorogue	1
the	1
legislature	1
of	1
this	1
State	1
for	1
a	1
limited	1
time;	1
a	1
power	1
which,	1
in	1
certain	1
situations,	1
may	1
be	1
employed	1
to	1
very	1
important	1
purposes.	1
The	1
President	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
power,	1
with	1
the	1
advice	1
and	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
to	1
make	1
treaties,	1
provided	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
senators	1
present	1
concur.	1
The	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
is	1
the	1
sole	1
and	1
absolute	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
in	1
all	1
foreign	1
transactions.	1
He	1
can	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
make	1
treaties	1
of	1
peace,	1
commerce,	1
alliance,	1
and	1
of	1
every	1
other	1
description.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
insinuated,	1
that	1
his	1
authority	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
is	1
not	1
conclusive,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
conventions	1
with	1
foreign	1
powers	1
are	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
revision,	1
and	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
ratification,	1
of	1
Parliament.	1
But	1
I	1
believe	1
this	1
doctrine	1
was	1
never	1
heard	1
of,	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
broached	1
upon	1
the	1
present	1
occasion.	1
Every	1
jurist2	1
of	1
that	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
every	1
other	1
man	1
acquainted	1
with	1
its	1
Constitution,	1
knows,	1
as	1
an	1
established	1
fact,	1
that	1
the	1
prerogative	1
of	1
making	1
treaties	1
exists	1
in	1
the	1
crown	1
in	1
its	1
utmost	1
plentitude;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
compacts	1
entered	1
into	1
by	1
the	1
royal	1
authority	1
have	1
the	1
most	1
complete	1
legal	1
validity	1
and	1
perfection,	1
independent	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
sanction.	1
The	1
Parliament,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
is	1
sometimes	1
seen	1
employing	1
itself	1
in	1
altering	1
the	1
existing	1
laws	1
to	1
conform	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
stipulations	1
in	1
a	1
new	1
treaty;	1
and	1
this	1
may	1
have	1
possibly	1
given	1
birth	1
to	1
the	1
imagination,	1
that	1
its	1
co-operation	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
obligatory	1
efficacy	1
of	1
the	1
treaty.	1
But	1
this	1
parliamentary	1
interposition	1
proceeds	1
from	1
a	1
different	1
cause:	1
from	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
adjusting	1
a	1
most	1
artificial	1
and	1
intricate	1
system	1
of	1
revenue	1
and	1
commercial	1
laws,	1
to	1
the	1
changes	1
made	1
in	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
the	1
treaty;	1
and	1
of	1
adapting	1
new	1
provisions	1
and	1
precautions	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
state	1
of	1
things,	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
machine	1
from	1
running	1
into	1
disorder.	1
In	1
this	1
respect,	1
therefore,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
comparison	1
between	1
the	1
intended	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
and	1
the	1
actual	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
sovereign.	1
The	1
one	1
can	1
perform	1
alone	1
what	1
the	1
other	1
can	1
do	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
admitted,	1
that,	1
in	1
this	1
instance,	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
Executive	1
would	1
exceed	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
State	1
Executive.	1
But	1
this	1
arises	1
naturally	1
from	1
the	1
sovereign	1
power	1
which	1
relates	1
to	1
treaties.	1
If	1
the	1
Confederacy	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
dissolved,	1
it	1
would	1
become	1
a	1
question,	1
whether	1
the	1
Executives	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States	1
were	1
not	1
solely	1
invested	1
with	1
that	1
delicate	1
and	1
important	1
prerogative.	1
The	1
President	1
is	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
authorized	1
to	1
receive	1
ambassadors	1
and	1
other	1
public	1
ministers.	1
This,	1
though	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
rich	1
theme	1
of	1
declamation,	1
is	1
more	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
dignity	1
than	1
of	1
authority.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
circumstance	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
without	1
consequence	1
in	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
government;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
far	1
more	1
convenient	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
arranged	1
in	1
this	1
manner,	1
than	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
necessity	1
of	1
convening	1
the	1
legislature,	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
branches,	1
upon	1
every	1
arrival	1
of	1
a	1
foreign	1
minister,	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
merely	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
a	1
departed	1
predecessor.	1
The	1
President	1
is	1
to	1
nominate,	1
and,	1
WITH	1
THE	1
ADVICE	1
AND	1
CONSENT	1
OF	1
THE	1
SENATE,	1
to	1
appoint	1
ambassadors	1
and	1
other	1
public	1
ministers,	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court,	1
and	1
in	1
general	1
all	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
established	1
by	1
law,	1
and	1
whose	1
appointments	1
are	1
not	1
otherwise	1
provided	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
The	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
is	1
emphatically	1
and	1
truly	1
styled	1
the	1
fountain	1
of	1
honor.	1
He	1
not	1
only	1
appoints	1
to	1
all	1
offices,	1
but	1
can	1
create	1
offices.	1
He	1
can	1
confer	1
titles	1
of	1
nobility	1
at	1
pleasure;	1
and	1
has	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
an	1
immense	1
number	1
of	1
church	1
preferments.	1
There	1
is	1
evidently	1
a	1
great	1
inferiority	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
President,	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
king;	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
equal	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
interpret	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
by	1
the	1
practice	1
which	1
has	1
obtained	1
under	1
it.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
appointment	1
is	1
with	1
us	1
lodged	1
in	1
a	1
council,	1
composed	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
and	1
four	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
chosen	1
by	1
the	1
Assembly.	1
The	1
governor	1
CLAIMS,	1
and	1
has	1
frequently	1
EXERCISED,	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
nomination,	1
and	1
is	1
ENTITLED	1
to	1
a	1
casting	1
vote	1
in	1
the	1
appointment.	1
If	1
he	1
really	1
has	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
nominating,	1
his	1
authority	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
equal	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
President,	1
and	1
exceeds	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
the	1
casting	1
vote.	1
In	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
if	1
the	1
Senate	1
should	1
be	1
divided,	1
no	1
appointment	1
could	1
be	1
made;	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
if	1
the	1
council	1
should	1
be	1
divided,	1
the	1
governor	1
can	1
turn	1
the	1
scale,	1
and	1
confirm	1
his	1
own	1
nomination.3	1
If	1
we	1
compare	1
the	1
publicity	1
which	1
must	1
necessarily	1
attend	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
appointment	1
by	1
the	1
President	1
and	1
an	1
entire	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
legislature,	1
with	1
the	1
privacy	1
in	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
appointment	1
by	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
closeted	1
in	1
a	1
secret	1
apartment	1
with	1
at	1
most	1
four,	1
and	1
frequently	1
with	1
only	1
two	1
persons;	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
consider	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
easy	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
influence	1
the	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
council	1
of	1
appointment	1
consists,	1
than	1
the	1
considerable	1
number	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
national	1
Senate	1
would	1
consist,	1
we	1
cannot	1
hesitate	1
to	1
pronounce	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate	1
of	1
this	1
State,	1
in	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
offices,	1
must,	1
in	1
practice,	1
be	1
greatly	1
superior	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Chief	1
Magistrate	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
Hence	1
it	1
appears	1
that,	1
except	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
concurrent	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
treaties,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
difficult	1
to	1
determine	1
whether	1
that	1
magistrate	1
would,	1
in	1
the	1
aggregate,	1
possess	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
power	1
than	1
the	1
Governor	1
of	1
New	1
York.	1
And	1
it	1
appears	1
yet	1
more	1
unequivocally,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
pretense	1
for	1
the	1
parallel	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
attempted	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain.	1
But	1
to	1
render	1
the	1
contrast	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
still	1
more	1
striking,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
throw	1
the	1
principal	1
circumstances	1
of	1
dissimilitude	1
into	1
a	1
closer	1
group.	1
The	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
officer	1
elected	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
FOUR	1
years;	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
is	1
a	1
perpetual	1
and	1
HEREDITARY	1
prince.	1
The	1
one	1
would	1
be	1
amenable	1
to	1
personal	1
punishment	1
and	1
disgrace;	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
sacred	1
and	1
inviolable.	1
The	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
QUALIFIED	1
negative	1
upon	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body;	1
the	1
other	1
has	1
an	1
ABSOLUTE	1
negative.	1
The	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
command	1
the	1
military	1
and	1
naval	1
forces	1
of	1
the	1
nation;	1
the	1
other,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
this	1
right,	1
possesses	1
that	1
of	1
DECLARING	1
war,	1
and	1
of	1
RAISING	1
and	1
REGULATING	1
fleets	1
and	1
armies	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
authority.	1
The	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
concurrent	1
power	1
with	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
in	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
treaties;	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
the	1
SOLE	1
POSSESSOR	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties.	1
The	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
like	1
concurrent	1
authority	1
in	1
appointing	1
to	1
offices;	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
the	1
sole	1
author	1
of	1
all	1
appointments.	1
The	1
one	1
can	1
confer	1
no	1
privileges	1
whatever;	1
the	1
other	1
can	1
make	1
denizens	1
of	1
aliens,	1
noblemen	1
of	1
commoners;	1
can	1
erect	1
corporations	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
rights	1
incident	1
to	1
corporate	1
bodies.	1
The	1
one	1
can	1
prescribe	1
no	1
rules	1
concerning	1
the	1
commerce	1
or	1
currency	1
of	1
the	1
nation;	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
in	1
several	1
respects	1
the	1
arbiter	1
of	1
commerce,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
capacity	1
can	1
establish	1
markets	1
and	1
fairs,	1
can	1
regulate	1
weights	1
and	1
measures,	1
can	1
lay	1
embargoes	1
for	1
a	1
limited	1
time,	1
can	1
coin	1
money,	1
can	1
authorize	1
or	1
prohibit	1
the	1
circulation	1
of	1
foreign	1
coin.	1
The	1
one	1
has	1
no	1
particle	1
of	1
spiritual	1
jurisdiction;	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
the	1
supreme	1
head	1
and	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
church!	1
What	1
answer	1
shall	1
we	1
give	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
persuade	1
us	1
that	1
things	1
so	1
unlike	1
resemble	1
each	1
other?	1
The	1
same	1
that	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
tell	1
us	1
that	1
a	1
government,	1
the	1
whole	1
power	1
of	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
elective	1
and	1
periodical	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
is	1
an	1
aristocracy,	1
a	1
monarchy,	1
and	1
a	1
despotism.	1
PUBLIUS.	1
1	1
A	1
writer	1
in	1
a	1
Pennsylvania	1
paper,	1
under	1
the	1
signature	1
of	1
TAMONY,	1
has	1
asserted	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
owes	1
his	1
prerogative	1
as	1
commander-in-chief	1
to	1
an	1
annual	1
mutiny	1
bill.	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
that	1
his	1
prerogative,	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
is	1
immemorial,	1
and	1
was	1
only	1
disputed,	1
"contrary	1
to	1
all	1
reason	1
and	1
precedent,"	1
as	1
Blackstone	1
vol.	1
i.,	1
page	1
262,	1
expresses	1
it,	1
by	1
the	1
Long	1
Parliament	1
of	1
Charles	1
I.	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
statute	1
the	1
13th	1
of	1
Charles	1
II.,	1
chap.	1
6,	1
it	1
was	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
king	1
alone,	1
for	1
that	1
the	1
sole	1
supreme	1
government	1
and	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
within	1
his	1
Majesty's	1
realms	1
and	1
dominions,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
forces	1
by	1
sea	1
and	1
land,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
forts	1
and	1
places	1
of	1
strength,	1
EVER	1
WAS	1
AND	1
IS	1
the	1
undoubted	1
right	1
of	1
his	1
Majesty	1
and	1
his	1
royal	1
predecessors,	1
kings	1
and	1
queens	1
of	1
England,	1
and	1
that	1
both	1
or	1
either	1
house	1
of	1
Parliament	1
cannot	1
nor	1
ought	1
to	1
pretend	1
to	1
the	1
same.	1

Vide	1
Blackstone's	1
"Commentaries,"	1

Candor,	1
however,	1
demands	1
an	1
acknowledgment	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
the	1
claim	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
to	1
a	1
right	1
of	1
nomination	1
well	1
founded.	1
Yet	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
justifiable	1
to	1
reason	1
from	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
a	1
government,	1
till	1
its	1
propriety	1
has	1
been	1
constitutionally	1
questioned.	1
And	1
independent	1
of	1
this	1
claim,	1
when	1
we	1
take	1
into	1
view	1
the	1
other	1
considerations,	1
and	1
pursue	1
them	1
through	1
all	1
their	1
consequences,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
inclined	1
to	1
draw	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
conclusion.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THERE	1
is	1
an	1
idea,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
its	1
advocates,	1
that	1
a	1
vigorous	1
Executive	1
is	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
republican	1
government.	1
The	1
enlightened	1
well-wishers	1
to	1
this	1
species	1
of	1
government	1
must	1
at	1
least	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
supposition	1
is	1
destitute	1
of	1
foundation;	1
since	1
they	1
can	1
never	1
admit	1
its	1
truth,	1
without	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
admitting	1
the	1
condemnation	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
principles.	1
Energy	1
in	1
the	1
Executive	1
is	1
a	1
leading	1
character	1
in	1
the	1
definition	1
of	1
good	1
government.	1
It	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
against	1
foreign	1
attacks;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
less	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
steady	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
laws;	1
to	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
property	1
against	1
those	1
irregular	1
and	1
high-handed	1
combinations	1
which	1
sometimes	1
interrupt	1
the	1
ordinary	1
course	1
of	1
justice;	1
to	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
liberty	1
against	1
the	1
enterprises	1
and	1
assaults	1
of	1
ambition,	1
of	1
faction,	1
and	1
of	1
anarchy.	1
Every	1
man	1
the	1
least	1
conversant	1
in	1
Roman	1
story,	1
knows	1
how	1
often	1
that	1
republic	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
absolute	1
power	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
man,	1
under	1
the	1
formidable	1
title	1
of	1
Dictator,	1
as	1
well	1
against	1
the	1
intrigues	1
of	1
ambitious	1
individuals	1
who	1
aspired	1
to	1
the	1
tyranny,	1
and	1
the	1
seditions	1
of	1
whole	1
classes	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
whose	1
conduct	1
threatened	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
all	1
government,	1
as	1
against	1
the	1
invasions	1
of	1
external	1
enemies	1
who	1
menaced	1
the	1
conquest	1
and	1
destruction	1
of	1
Rome.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
need,	1
however,	1
to	1
multiply	1
arguments	1
or	1
examples	1
on	1
this	1
head.	1
A	1
feeble	1
Executive	1
implies	1
a	1
feeble	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
A	1
feeble	1
execution	1
is	1
but	1
another	1
phrase	1
for	1
a	1
bad	1
execution;	1
and	1
a	1
government	1
ill	1
executed,	1
whatever	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
theory,	1
must	1
be,	1
in	1
practice,	1
a	1
bad	1
government.	1
Taking	1
it	1
for	1
granted,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
sense	1
will	1
agree	1
in	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
an	1
energetic	1
Executive,	1
it	1
will	1
only	1
remain	1
to	1
inquire,	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
ingredients	1
which	1
constitute	1
this	1
energy?	1
How	1
far	1
can	1
they	1
be	1
combined	1
with	1
those	1
other	1
ingredients	1
which	1
constitute	1
safety	1
in	1
the	1
republican	1
sense?	1
And	1
how	1
far	1
does	1
this	1
combination	1
characterize	1
the	1
plan	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
reported	1
by	1
the	1
convention?	1
The	1
ingredients	1
which	1
constitute	1
energy	1
in	1
the	1
Executive	1
are,	1
first,	1
unity;	1
secondly,	1
duration;	1
thirdly,	1
an	1
adequate	1
provision	1
for	1
its	1
support;	1
fourthly,	1
competent	1
powers.	1
The	1
ingredients	1
which	1
constitute	1
safety	1
in	1
the	1
repub	1
lican	1
sense	1
are,	1
first,	1
a	1
due	1
dependence	1
on	1
the	1
people,	1
secondly,	1
a	1
due	1
responsibility.	1
Those	1
politicians	1
and	1
statesmen	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
celebrated	1
for	1
the	1
soundness	1
of	1
their	1
principles	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
their	1
views,	1
have	1
declared	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
Executive	1
and	1
a	1
numerous	1
legislature.	1
They	1
have	1
with	1
great	1
propriety,	1
considered	1
energy	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
necessary	1
qualification	1
of	1
the	1
former,	1
and	1
have	1
regarded	1
this	1
as	1
most	1
applicable	1
to	1
power	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
hand,	1
while	1
they	1
have,	1
with	1
equal	1
propriety,	1
considered	1
the	1
latter	1
as	1
best	1
adapted	1
to	1
deliberation	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
best	1
calculated	1
to	1
conciliate	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
to	1
secure	1
their	1
privileges	1
and	1
interests.	1
That	1
unity	1
is	1
conducive	1
to	1
energy	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
disputed.	1
Decision,	1
activity,	1
secrecy,	1
and	1
despatch	1
will	1
generally	1
characterize	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
one	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
much	1
more	1
eminent	1
degree	1
than	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
any	1
greater	1
number;	1
and	1
in	1
proportion	1
as	1
the	1
number	1
is	1
increased,	1
these	1
qualities	1
will	1
be	1
diminished.	1
This	1
unity	1
may	1
be	1
destroyed	1
in	1
two	1
ways:	1
either	1
by	1
vesting	1
the	1
power	1
in	1
two	1
or	1
more	1
magistrates	1
of	1
equal	1
dignity	1
and	1
authority;	1
or	1
by	1
vesting	1
it	1
ostensibly	1
in	1
one	1
man,	1
subject,	1
in	1
whole	1
or	1
in	1
part,	1
to	1
the	1
control	1
and	1
co-operation	1
of	1
others,	1
in	1
the	1
capacity	1
of	1
counsellors	1
to	1
him.	1
Of	1
the	1
first,	1
the	1
two	1
Consuls	1
of	1
Rome	1
may	1
serve	1
as	1
an	1
example;	1
of	1
the	1
last,	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
examples	1
in	1
the	1
constitutions	1
of	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
New	1
York	1
and	1
New	1
Jersey,	1
if	1
I	1
recollect	1
right,	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
States	1
which	1
have	1
intrusted	1
the	1
executive	1
authority	1
wholly	1
to	1
single	1
men.1	1
Both	1
these	1
methods	1
of	1
destroying	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
have	1
their	1
partisans;	1
but	1
the	1
votaries	1
of	1
an	1
executive	1
council	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
numerous.	1
They	1
are	1
both	1
liable,	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
equal,	1
to	1
similar	1
objections,	1
and	1
may	1
in	1
most	1
lights	1
be	1
examined	1
in	1
conjunction.	1
The	1
experience	1
of	1
other	1
nations	1
will	1
afford	1
little	1
instruction	1
on	1
this	1
head.	1
As	1
far,	1
however,	1
as	1
it	1
teaches	1
any	1
thing,	1
it	1
teaches	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
enamoured	1
of	1
plurality	1
in	1
the	1
Executive.	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
the	1
Achaeans,	1
on	1
an	1
experiment	1
of	1
two	1
Praetors,	1
were	1
induced	1
to	1
abolish	1
one.	1
The	1
Roman	1
history	1
records	1
many	1
instances	1
of	1
mischiefs	1
to	1
the	1
republic	1
from	1
the	1
dissensions	1
between	1
the	1
Consuls,	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
military	1
Tribunes,	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
times	1
substituted	1
for	1
the	1
Consuls.	1
But	1
it	1
gives	1
us	1
no	1
specimens	1
of	1
any	1
peculiar	1
advantages	1
derived	1
to	1
the	1
state	1
from	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
the	1
plurality	1
of	1
those	1
magistrates.	1
That	1
the	1
dissensions	1
between	1
them	1
were	1
not	1
more	1
frequent	1
or	1
more	1
fatal,	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
astonishment,	1
until	1
we	1
advert	1
to	1
the	1
singular	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
republic	1
was	1
almost	1
continually	1
placed,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prudent	1
policy	1
pointed	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
state,	1
and	1
pursued	1
by	1
the	1
Consuls,	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
between	1
them.	1
The	1
patricians	1
engaged	1
in	1
a	1
perpetual	1
struggle	1
with	1
the	1
plebeians	1
for	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
their	1
ancient	1
authorities	1
and	1
dignities;	1
the	1
Consuls,	1
who	1
were	1
generally	1
chosen	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
body,	1
were	1
commonly	1
united	1
by	1
the	1
personal	1
interest	1
they	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
privileges	1
of	1
their	1
order.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
this	1
motive	1
of	1
union,	1
after	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
republic	1
had	1
considerably	1
expanded	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
its	1
empire,	1
it	1
became	1
an	1
established	1
custom	1
with	1
the	1
Consuls	1
to	1
divide	1
the	1
administration	1
between	1
themselves	1
by	1
lot	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
remaining	1
at	1
Rome	1
to	1
govern	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
its	1
environs,	1
the	1
other	1
taking	1
the	1
command	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
distant	1
provinces.	1
This	1
expedient	1
must,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
have	1
had	1
great	1
influence	1
in	1
preventing	1
those	1
collisions	1
and	1
rivalships	1
which	1
might	1
otherwise	1
have	1
embroiled	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
republic.	1
But	1
quitting	1
the	1
dim	1
light	1
of	1
historical	1
research,	1
attaching	1
ourselves	1
purely	1
to	1
the	1
dictates	1
of	1
reason	1
and	1
good	1
sense,	1
we	1
shall	1
discover	1
much	1
greater	1
cause	1
to	1
reject	1
than	1
to	1
approve	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
plurality	1
in	1
the	1
Executive,	1
under	1
any	1
modification	1
whatever.	1
Wherever	1
two	1
or	1
more	1
persons	1
are	1
engaged	1
in	1
any	1
common	1
enterprise	1
or	1
pursuit,	1
there	1
is	1
always	1
danger	1
of	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
public	1
trust	1
or	1
office,	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
clothed	1
with	1
equal	1
dignity	1
and	1
authority,	1
there	1
is	1
peculiar	1
danger	1
of	1
personal	1
emulation	1
and	1
even	1
animosity.	1
From	1
either,	1
and	1
especially	1
from	1
all	1
these	1
causes,	1
the	1
most	1
bitter	1
dissensions	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
spring.	1
Whenever	1
these	1
happen,	1
they	1
lessen	1
the	1
respectability,	1
weaken	1
the	1
authority,	1
and	1
distract	1
the	1
plans	1
and	1
operation	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
they	1
divide.	1
If	1
they	1
should	1
unfortunately	1
assail	1
the	1
supreme	1
executive	1
magistracy	1
of	1
a	1
country,	1
consisting	1
of	1
a	1
plurality	1
of	1
persons,	1
they	1
might	1
impede	1
or	1
frustrate	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
measures	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
critical	1
emergencies	1
of	1
the	1
state.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
still	1
worse,	1
they	1
might	1
split	1
the	1
community	1
into	1
the	1
most	1
violent	1
and	1
irreconcilable	1
factions,	1
adhering	1
differently	1
to	1
the	1
different	1
individuals	1
who	1
composed	1
the	1
magistracy.	1
Men	1
often	1
oppose	1
a	1
thing,	1
merely	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
agency	1
in	1
planning	1
it,	1
or	1
because	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
planned	1
by	1
those	1
whom	1
they	1
dislike.	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
consulted,	1
and	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
disapprove,	1
opposition	1
then	1
becomes,	1
in	1
their	1
estimation,	1
an	1
indispensable	1
duty	1
of	1
self-love.	1
They	1
seem	1
to	1
think	1
themselves	1
bound	1
in	1
honor,	1
and	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
motives	1
of	1
personal	1
infallibility,	1
to	1
defeat	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
resolved	1
upon	1
contrary	1
to	1
their	1
sentiments.	1
Men	1
of	1
upright,	1
benevolent	1
tempers	1
have	1
too	1
many	1
opportunities	1
of	1
remarking,	1
with	1
horror,	1
to	1
what	1
desperate	1
lengths	1
this	1
disposition	1
is	1
sometimes	1
carried,	1
and	1
how	1
often	1
the	1
great	1
interests	1
of	1
society	1
are	1
sacrificed	1
to	1
the	1
vanity,	1
to	1
the	1
conceit,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
obstinacy	1
of	1
individuals,	1
who	1
have	1
credit	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
passions	1
and	1
their	1
caprices	1
interesting	1
to	1
mankind.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
question	1
now	1
before	1
the	1
public	1
may,	1
in	1
its	1
consequences,	1
afford	1
melancholy	1
proofs	1
of	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
this	1
despicable	1
frailty,	1
or	1
rather	1
detestable	1
vice,	1
in	1
the	1
human	1
character.	1
Upon	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
a	1
free	1
government,	1
inconveniences	1
from	1
the	1
source	1
just	1
mentioned	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
submitted	1
to	1
in	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
the	1
legislature;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
unnecessary,	1
and	1
therefore	1
unwise,	1
to	1
introduce	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
Executive.	1
It	1
is	1
here	1
too	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
most	1
pernicious.	1
In	1
the	1
legislature,	1
promptitude	1
of	1
decision	1
is	1
oftener	1
an	1
evil	1
than	1
a	1
benefit.	1
The	1
differences	1
of	1
opinion,	1
and	1
the	1
jarrings	1
of	1
parties	1
in	1
that	1
department	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
though	1
they	1
may	1
sometimes	1
obstruct	1
salutary	1
plans,	1
yet	1
often	1
promote	1
deliberation	1
and	1
circumspection,	1
and	1
serve	1
to	1
check	1
excesses	1
in	1
the	1
majority.	1
When	1
a	1
resolution	1
too	1
is	1
once	1
taken,	1
the	1
opposition	1
must	1
be	1
at	1
an	1
end.	1
That	1
resolution	1
is	1
a	1
law,	1
and	1
resistance	1
to	1
it	1
punishable.	1
But	1
no	1
favorable	1
circumstances	1
palliate	1
or	1
atone	1
for	1
the	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
dissension	1
in	1
the	1
executive	1
department.	1
Here,	1
they	1
are	1
pure	1
and	1
unmixed.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
point	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
cease	1
to	1
operate.	1
They	1
serve	1
to	1
embarrass	1
and	1
weaken	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
or	1
measure	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
relate,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
to	1
the	1
final	1
conclusion	1
of	1
it.	1
They	1
constantly	1
counteract	1
those	1
qualities	1
in	1
the	1
Executive	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
necessary	1
ingredients	1
in	1
its	1
composition,	1
vigor	1
and	1
expedition,	1
and	1
this	1
without	1
anycounterbalancing	1
good.	1
In	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
war,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
is	1
the	1
bulwark	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
security,	1
every	1
thing	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
be	1
apprehended	1
from	1
its	1
plurality.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
confessed	1
that	1
these	1
observations	1
apply	1
with	1
principal	1
weight	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
case	1
supposed	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
a	1
plurality	1
of	1
magistrates	1
of	1
equal	1
dignity	1
and	1
authority	1
a	1
scheme,	1
the	1
advocates	1
for	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
numerous	1
sect;	1
but	1
they	1
apply,	1
though	1
not	1
with	1
equal,	1
yet	1
with	1
considerable	1
weight	1
to	1
the	1
project	1
of	1
a	1
council,	1
whose	1
concurrence	1
is	1
made	1
constitutionally	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
the	1
ostensible	1
Executive.	1
An	1
artful	1
cabal	1
in	1
that	1
council	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
distract	1
and	1
to	1
enervate	1
the	1
whole	1
system	1
of	1
administration.	1
If	1
no	1
such	1
cabal	1
should	1
exist,	1
the	1
mere	1
diversity	1
of	1
views	1
and	1
opinions	1
would	1
alone	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
tincture	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
authority	1
with	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
habitual	1
feebleness	1
and	1
dilatoriness.	1
But	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
weightiest	1
objections	1
to	1
a	1
plurality	1
in	1
the	1
Executive,	1
and	1
which	1
lies	1
as	1
much	1
against	1
the	1
last	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
plan,	1
is,	1
that	1
it	1
tends	1
to	1
conceal	1
faults	1
and	1
destroy	1
responsibility.	1
Responsibility	1
is	1
of	1
two	1
kinds	1
to	1
censure	1
and	1
to	1
punishment.	1
The	1
first	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
important	1
of	1
the	1
two,	1
especially	1
in	1
an	1
elective	1
office.	1
Man,	1
in	1
public	1
trust,	1
will	1
much	1
oftener	1
act	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
him	1
unworthy	1
of	1
being	1
any	1
longer	1
trusted,	1
than	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
obnoxious	1
to	1
legal	1
punishment.	1
But	1
the	1
multiplication	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
adds	1
to	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
detection	1
in	1
either	1
case.	1
It	1
often	1
becomes	1
impossible,	1
amidst	1
mutual	1
accusations,	1
to	1
determine	1
on	1
whom	1
the	1
blame	1
or	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
a	1
pernicious	1
measure,	1
or	1
series	1
of	1
pernicious	1
measures,	1
ought	1
really	1
to	1
fall.	1
It	1
is	1
shifted	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
dexterity,	1
and	1
under	1
such	1
plausible	1
appearances,	1
that	1
the	1
public	1
opinion	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
suspense	1
about	1
the	1
real	1
author.	1
The	1
circumstances	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
led	1
to	1
any	1
national	1
miscarriage	1
or	1
misfortune	1
are	1
sometimes	1
so	1
complicated	1
that,	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
actors	1
who	1
may	1
have	1
had	1
different	1
degrees	1
and	1
kinds	1
of	1
agency,	1
though	1
we	1
may	1
clearly	1
see	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
that	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
mismanagement,	1
yet	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
impracticable	1
to	1
pronounce	1
to	1
whose	1
account	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
incurred	1
is	1
truly	1
chargeable.	1
"I	1
was	1
overruled	1
by	1
my	1
council.	1
The	1
council	1
were	1
so	1
divided	1
in	1
their	1
opinions	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
obtain	1
any	1
better	1
resolution	1
on	1
the	1
point."	1
These	1
and	1
similar	1
pretexts	1
are	1
constantly	1
at	1
hand,	1
whether	1
true	1
or	1
false.	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
will	1
either	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
or	1
incur	1
the	1
odium,	1
of	1
a	1
strict	1
scrunity	1
into	1
the	1
secret	1
springs	1
of	1
the	1
transaction?	1
Should	1
there	1
be	1
found	1
a	1
citizen	1
zealous	1
enough	1
to	1
undertake	1
the	1
unpromising	1
task,	1
if	1
there	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
collusion	1
between	1
the	1
parties	1
concerned,	1
how	1
easy	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
clothe	1
the	1
circumstances	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
ambiguity,	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
it	1
uncertain	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
precise	1
conduct	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
parties?	1
In	1
the	1
single	1
instance	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
this	1
State	1
is	1
coupled	1
with	1
a	1
council	1
that	1
is,	1
in	1
the	1
appointment	1
to	1
offices,	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
mischiefs	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
view	1
now	1
under	1
consideration.	1
Scandalous	1
appointments	1
to	1
important	1
offices	1
have	1
been	1
made.	1
Some	1
cases,	1
indeed,	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
flagrant	1
that	1
ALL	1
PARTIES	1
have	1
agreed	1
in	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
the	1
thing.	1
When	1
inquiry	1
has	1
been	1
made,	1
the	1
blame	1
has	1
been	1
laid	1
by	1
the	1
governor	1
on	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
council,	1
who,	1
on	1
their	1
part,	1
have	1
charged	1
it	1
upon	1
his	1
nomination;	1
while	1
the	1
people	1
remain	1
altogether	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
determine,	1
by	1
whose	1
influence	1
their	1
interests	1
have	1
been	1
committed	1
to	1
hands	1
so	1
unqualified	1
and	1
so	1
manifestly	1
improper.	1
In	1
tenderness	1
to	1
individuals,	1
I	1
forbear	1
to	1
descend	1
to	1
particulars.	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
from	1
these	1
considerations,	1
that	1
the	1
plurality	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
tends	1
to	1
deprive	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
greatest	1
securities	1
they	1
can	1
have	1
for	1
the	1
faithful	1
exercise	1
of	1
any	1
delegated	1
power,	1
first,	1
the	1
restraints	1
of	1
public	1
opinion,	1
which	1
lose	1
their	1
efficacy,	1
as	1
well	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
censure	1
attendant	1
on	1
bad	1
measures	1
among	1
a	1
number,	1
as	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
uncertainty	1
on	1
whom	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
fall;	1
and,	1
secondly,	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
discovering	1
with	1
facility	1
and	1
clearness	1
the	1
misconduct	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
they	1
trust,	1
in	1
order	1
either	1
to	1
their	1
removal	1
from	1
office	1
or	1
to	1
their	1
actual	1
punishment	1
in	1
cases	1
which	1
admit	1
of	1
it.	1
In	1
England,	1
the	1
king	1
is	1
a	1
perpetual	1
magistrate;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
maxim	1
which	1
has	1
obtained	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
pub	1
lic	1
peace,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
unaccountable	1
for	1
his	1
administration,	1
and	1
his	1
person	1
sacred.	1
Nothing,	1
therefore,	1
can	1
be	1
wiser	1
in	1
that	1
kingdom,	1
than	1
to	1
annex	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
a	1
constitutional	1
council,	1
who	1
may	1
be	1
responsible	1
to	1
the	1
nation	1
for	1
the	1
advice	1
they	1
give.	1
Without	1
this,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
responsibility	1
whatever	1
in	1
the	1
executive	1
department	1
an	1
idea	1
inadmissible	1
in	1
a	1
free	1
government.	1
But	1
even	1
there	1
the	1
king	1
is	1
not	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
resolutions	1
of	1
his	1
council,	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
answerable	1
for	1
the	1
advice	1
they	1
give.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
absolute	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
conduct	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
his	1
office,	1
and	1
may	1
observe	1
or	1
disregard	1
the	1
counsel	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
sole	1
discretion.	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
republic,	1
where	1
every	1
magistrate	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
personally	1
responsible	1
for	1
his	1
behavior	1
in	1
office	1
the	1
reason	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
British	1
Constitution	1
dictates	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
a	1
council,	1
not	1
only	1
ceases	1
to	1
apply,	1
but	1
turns	1
against	1
the	1
institution.	1
In	1
the	1
monarchy	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
it	1
furnishes	1
a	1
substitute	1
for	1
the	1
prohibited	1
responsibility	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate,	1
which	1
serves	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
as	1
a	1
hostage	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
justice	1
for	1
his	1
good	1
behavior.	1
In	1
the	1
American	1
republic,	1
it	1
would	1
serve	1
to	1
destroy,	1
or	1
would	1
greatly	1
diminish,	1
the	1
intended	1
and	1
necessary	1
responsibility	1
of	1
the	1
Chief	1
Magistrate	1
himself.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
council	1
to	1
the	1
Executive,	1
which	1
has	1
so	1
generally	1
obtained	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
has	1
been	1
derived	1
from	1
that	1
maxim	1
of	1
republican	1
jealousy	1
which	1
considers	1
power	1
as	1
safer	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
than	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
man.	1
If	1
the	1
maxim	1
should	1
be	1
admitted	1
to	1
be	1
applicable	1
to	1
the	1
case,	1
I	1
should	1
contend	1
that	1
the	1
advantage	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
would	1
not	1
counterbalance	1
the	1
numerous	1
disadvantages	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side.	1
But	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
the	1
rule	1
at	1
all	1
applicable	1
to	1
the	1
executive	1
power.	1
I	1
clearly	1
concur	1
in	1
opinion,	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
with	1
a	1
writer	1
whom	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Junius	1
pronounces	1
to	1
be	1
"deep,	1
solid,	1
and	1
ingenious,"	1
that	1
"the	1
executive	1
power	1
is	1
more	1
easily	1
confined	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
ONE";2	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
far	1
more	1
safe	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
single	1
object	1
for	1
the	1
jealousy	1
and	1
watchfulness	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
and,	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
that	1
all	1
multiplication	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
is	1
rather	1
dangerous	1
than	1
friendly	1
to	1
liberty.	1
A	1
little	1
consideration	1
will	1
satisfy	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
species	1
of	1
security	1
sought	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
multiplication	1
of	1
the	1
Executive,	1
is	1
nattainable.	1
Numbers	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
great	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
combination	1
difficult,	1
or	1
they	1
are	1
rather	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
danger	1
than	1
of	1
security.	1
The	1
united	1
credit	1
and	1
influence	1
of	1
several	1
individuals	1
must	1
be	1
more	1
formidable	1
to	1
liberty,	1
than	1
the	1
credit	1
and	1
influence	1
of	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
separately.	1
When	1
power,	1
therefore,	1
is	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men,	1
as	1
to	1
admit	1
of	1
their	1
interests	1
and	1
views	1
being	1
easily	1
combined	1
in	1
a	1
common	1
enterprise,	1
by	1
an	1
artful	1
leader,	1
it	1
becomes	1
more	1
liable	1
to	1
abuse,	1
and	1
more	1
dangerous	1
when	1
abused,	1
than	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
one	1
man;	1
who,	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
circumstance	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
alone,	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
narrowly	1
watched	1
and	1
more	1
readily	1
suspected,	1
and	1
who	1
cannot	1
unite	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
influence	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
associated	1
with	1
others.	1
The	1
Decemvirs	1
of	1
Rome,	1
whose	1
name	1
denotes	1
their	1
number,3	1
were	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
dreaded	1
in	1
their	1
usurpation	1
than	1
any	1
ONE	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
have	1
been.	1
No	1
person	1
would	1
think	1
of	1
proposing	1
an	1
Executive	1
much	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
that	1
body;	1
from	1
six	1
to	1
a	1
dozen	1
have	1
been	1
suggested	1
for	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
council.	1
The	1
extreme	1
of	1
these	1
numbers,	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
great	1
for	1
an	1
easy	1
combination;	1
and	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
combination	1
America	1
would	1
have	1
more	1
to	1
fear,	1
than	1
from	1
the	1
ambition	1
of	1
any	1
single	1
individual.	1
A	1
council	1
to	1
a	1
magistrate,	1
who	1
is	1
himself	1
responsible	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
does,	1
are	1
generally	1
nothing	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
clog	1
upon	1
his	1
good	1
intentions,	1
are	1
often	1
the	1
instruments	1
and	1
accomplices	1
of	1
his	1
bad	1
and	1
are	1
almost	1
always	1
a	1
cloak	1
to	1
his	1
faults.	1
I	1
forbear	1
to	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
expense;	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
evident	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
council	1
should	1
be	1
numerous	1
enough	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
principal	1
end	1
aimed	1
at	1
by	1
the	1
institution,	1
the	1
salaries	1
of	1
the	1
members,	1
who	1
must	1
be	1
drawn	1
from	1
their	1
homes	1
to	1
reside	1
at	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
government,	1
would	1
form	1
an	1
item	1
in	1
the	1
catalogue	1
of	1
public	1
expenditures	1
too	1
serious	1
to	1
be	1
incurred	1
for	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
equivocal	1
utility.	1
I	1
will	1
only	1
add	1
that,	1
prior	1
to	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
I	1
rarely	1
met	1
with	1
an	1
intelligent	1
man	1
from	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
admit,	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
experience,	1
that	1
the	1
UNITY	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
of	1
this	1
State	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
distinguishing	1
features	1
of	1
our	1
constitution.	1
PUBLIUS.	1
1	1
New	1

to	1
offices;	1
New	1
Jersey	1
has	1
a	1
council	1
whom	1
the	1
governor	1
may	1
consult.	1
But	1
I	1
think,	1
from	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
constitution,	1
their	1
resolutions	1
do	1
not	1
bind	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THERE	1
is	1
an	1
idea,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
its	1
advocates,	1
that	1
a	1
vigorous	1
Executive	1
is	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
republican	1
government.	1
The	1
enlightened	1
well-wishers	1
to	1
this	1
species	1
of	1
government	1
must	1
at	1
least	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
supposition	1
is	1
destitute	1
of	1
foundation;	1
since	1
they	1
can	1
never	1
admit	1
its	1
truth,	1
without	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
admitting	1
the	1
condemnation	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
principles.	1
Energy	1
in	1
the	1
Executive	1
is	1
a	1
leading	1
character	1
in	1
the	1
definition	1
of	1
good	1
government.	1
It	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
against	1
foreign	1
attacks;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
less	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
steady	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
laws;	1
to	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
property	1
against	1
those	1
irregular	1
and	1
high-handed	1
combinations	1
which	1
sometimes	1
interrupt	1
the	1
ordinary	1
course	1
of	1
justice;	1
to	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
liberty	1
against	1
the	1
enterprises	1
and	1
assaults	1
of	1
ambition,	1
of	1
faction,	1
and	1
of	1
anarchy.	1
Every	1
man	1
the	1
least	1
conversant	1
in	1
Roman	1
story,	1
knows	1
how	1
often	1
that	1
republic	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
refuge	1
in	1
the	1
absolute	1
power	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
man,	1
under	1
the	1
formidable	1
title	1
of	1
Dictator,	1
as	1
well	1
against	1
the	1
intrigues	1
of	1
ambitious	1
individuals	1
who	1
aspired	1
to	1
the	1
tyranny,	1
and	1
the	1
seditions	1
of	1
whole	1
classes	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
whose	1
conduct	1
threatened	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
all	1
government,	1
as	1
against	1
the	1
invasions	1
of	1
external	1
enemies	1
who	1
menaced	1
the	1
conquest	1
and	1
destruction	1
of	1
Rome.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
need,	1
however,	1
to	1
multiply	1
arguments	1
or	1
examples	1
on	1
this	1
head.	1
A	1
feeble	1
Executive	1
implies	1
a	1
feeble	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
A	1
feeble	1
execution	1
is	1
but	1
another	1
phrase	1
for	1
a	1
bad	1
execution;	1
and	1
a	1
government	1
ill	1
executed,	1
whatever	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
theory,	1
must	1
be,	1
in	1
practice,	1
a	1
bad	1
government.	1
Taking	1
it	1
for	1
granted,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
sense	1
will	1
agree	1
in	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
an	1
energetic	1
Executive,	1
it	1
will	1
only	1
remain	1
to	1
inquire,	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
ingredients	1
which	1
constitute	1
this	1
energy?	1
How	1
far	1
can	1
they	1
be	1
combined	1
with	1
those	1
other	1
ingredients	1
which	1
constitute	1
safety	1
in	1
the	1
republican	1
sense?	1
And	1
how	1
far	1
does	1
this	1
combination	1
characterize	1
the	1
plan	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
reported	1
by	1
the	1
convention?	1
The	1
ingredients	1
which	1
constitute	1
energy	1
in	1
the	1
Executive	1
are,	1
first,	1
unity;	1
secondly,	1
duration;	1
thirdly,	1
an	1
adequate	1
provision	1
for	1
its	1
support;	1
fourthly,	1
competent	1
powers.	1
The	1
ingredients	1
which	1
constitute	1
safety	1
in	1
the	1
repub	1
lican	1
sense	1
are,	1
first,	1
a	1
due	1
dependence	1
on	1
the	1
people,	1
secondly,	1
a	1
due	1
responsibility.	1
Those	1
politicians	1
and	1
statesmen	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
celebrated	1
for	1
the	1
soundness	1
of	1
their	1
principles	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
their	1
views,	1
have	1
declared	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
Executive	1
and	1
a	1
numerous	1
legislature.	1
They	1
have	1
with	1
great	1
propriety,	1
considered	1
energy	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
necessary	1
qualification	1
of	1
the	1
former,	1
and	1
have	1
regarded	1
this	1
as	1
most	1
applicable	1
to	1
power	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
hand,	1
while	1
they	1
have,	1
with	1
equal	1
propriety,	1
considered	1
the	1
latter	1
as	1
best	1
adapted	1
to	1
deliberation	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
best	1
calculated	1
to	1
conciliate	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
to	1
secure	1
their	1
privileges	1
and	1
interests.	1
That	1
unity	1
is	1
conducive	1
to	1
energy	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
disputed.	1
Decision,	1
activity,	1
secrecy,	1
and	1
despatch	1
will	1
generally	1
characterize	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
one	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
much	1
more	1
eminent	1
degree	1
than	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
any	1
greater	1
number;	1
and	1
in	1
proportion	1
as	1
the	1
number	1
is	1
increased,	1
these	1
qualities	1
will	1
be	1
diminished.	1
This	1
unity	1
may	1
be	1
destroyed	1
in	1
two	1
ways:	1
either	1
by	1
vesting	1
the	1
power	1
in	1
two	1
or	1
more	1
magistrates	1
of	1
equal	1
dignity	1
and	1
authority;	1
or	1
by	1
vesting	1
it	1
ostensibly	1
in	1
one	1
man,	1
subject,	1
in	1
whole	1
or	1
in	1
part,	1
to	1
the	1
control	1
and	1
co-operation	1
of	1
others,	1
in	1
the	1
capacity	1
of	1
counsellors	1
to	1
him.	1
Of	1
the	1
first,	1
the	1
two	1
Consuls	1
of	1
Rome	1
may	1
serve	1
as	1
an	1
example;	1
of	1
the	1
last,	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
examples	1
in	1
the	1
constitutions	1
of	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
New	1
York	1
and	1
New	1
Jersey,	1
if	1
I	1
recollect	1
right,	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
States	1
which	1
have	1
intrusted	1
the	1
executive	1
authority	1
wholly	1
to	1
single	1
men.1	1
Both	1
these	1
methods	1
of	1
destroying	1
the	1
unity	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
have	1
their	1
partisans;	1
but	1
the	1
votaries	1
of	1
an	1
executive	1
council	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
numerous.	1
They	1
are	1
both	1
liable,	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
equal,	1
to	1
similar	1
objections,	1
and	1
may	1
in	1
most	1
lights	1
be	1
examined	1
in	1
conjunction.	1
The	1
experience	1
of	1
other	1
nations	1
will	1
afford	1
little	1
instruction	1
on	1
this	1
head.	1
As	1
far,	1
however,	1
as	1
it	1
teaches	1
any	1
thing,	1
it	1
teaches	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
enamoured	1
of	1
plurality	1
in	1
the	1
Executive.	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
the	1
Achaeans,	1
on	1
an	1
experiment	1
of	1
two	1
Praetors,	1
were	1
induced	1
to	1
abolish	1
one.	1
The	1
Roman	1
history	1
records	1
many	1
instances	1
of	1
mischiefs	1
to	1
the	1
republic	1
from	1
the	1
dissensions	1
between	1
the	1
Consuls,	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
military	1
Tribunes,	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
times	1
substituted	1
for	1
the	1
Consuls.	1
But	1
it	1
gives	1
us	1
no	1
specimens	1
of	1
any	1
peculiar	1
advantages	1
derived	1
to	1
the	1
state	1
from	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
the	1
plurality	1
of	1
those	1
magistrates.	1
That	1
the	1
dissensions	1
between	1
them	1
were	1
not	1
more	1
frequent	1
or	1
more	1
fatal,	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
astonishment,	1
until	1
we	1
advert	1
to	1
the	1
singular	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
republic	1
was	1
almost	1
continually	1
placed,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
prudent	1
policy	1
pointed	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
state,	1
and	1
pursued	1
by	1
the	1
Consuls,	1
of	1
making	1
a	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
between	1
them.	1
The	1
patricians	1
engaged	1
in	1
a	1
perpetual	1
struggle	1
with	1
the	1
plebeians	1
for	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
their	1
ancient	1
authorities	1
and	1
dignities;	1
the	1
Consuls,	1
who	1
were	1
generally	1
chosen	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
body,	1
were	1
commonly	1
united	1
by	1
the	1
personal	1
interest	1
they	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
defense	1
of	1
the	1
privileges	1
of	1
their	1
order.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
this	1
motive	1
of	1
union,	1
after	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
republic	1
had	1
considerably	1
expanded	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
its	1
empire,	1
it	1
became	1
an	1
established	1
custom	1
with	1
the	1
Consuls	1
to	1
divide	1
the	1
administration	1
between	1
themselves	1
by	1
lot	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
remaining	1
at	1
Rome	1
to	1
govern	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
its	1
environs,	1
the	1
other	1
taking	1
the	1
command	1
in	1
the	1
more	1
distant	1
provinces.	1
This	1
expedient	1
must,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
have	1
had	1
great	1
influence	1
in	1
preventing	1
those	1
collisions	1
and	1
rivalships	1
which	1
might	1
otherwise	1
have	1
embroiled	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
republic.	1
But	1
quitting	1
the	1
dim	1
light	1
of	1
historical	1
research,	1
attaching	1
ourselves	1
purely	1
to	1
the	1
dictates	1
of	1
reason	1
and	1
good	1
se	1
se,	1
we	1
shall	1
discover	1
much	1
greater	1
cause	1
to	1
reject	1
than	1
to	1
approve	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
plurality	1
in	1
the	1
Executive,	1
under	1
any	1
modification	1
whatever.	1
Wherever	1
two	1
or	1
more	1
persons	1
are	1
engaged	1
in	1
any	1
common	1
enterprise	1
or	1
pursuit,	1
there	1
is	1
always	1
danger	1
of	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
public	1
trust	1
or	1
office,	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
clothed	1
with	1
equal	1
dignity	1
and	1
authority,	1
there	1
is	1
peculiar	1
danger	1
of	1
personal	1
emulation	1
and	1
even	1
animosity.	1
From	1
either,	1
and	1
especially	1
from	1
all	1
these	1
causes,	1
the	1
most	1
bitter	1
dissensions	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
spring.	1
Whenever	1
these	1
happen,	1
they	1
lessen	1
the	1
respectability,	1
weaken	1
the	1
authority,	1
and	1
distract	1
the	1
plans	1
and	1
operation	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
they	1
divide.	1
If	1
they	1
should	1
unfortunately	1
assail	1
the	1
supreme	1
executive	1
magistracy	1
of	1
a	1
country,	1
consisting	1
of	1
a	1
plurality	1
of	1
persons,	1
they	1
might	1
impede	1
or	1
frustrate	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
measures	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
critical	1
emergencies	1
of	1
the	1
state.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
still	1
worse,	1
they	1
might	1
split	1
the	1
community	1
into	1
the	1
most	1
violent	1
and	1
irreconcilable	1
factions,	1
adhering	1
differently	1
to	1
the	1
different	1
individuals	1
who	1
composed	1
the	1
magistracy.	1
Men	1
often	1
oppose	1
a	1
thing,	1
merely	1
because	1
they	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
agency	1
in	1
planning	1
it,	1
or	1
because	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
planned	1
by	1
those	1
whom	1
they	1
dislike.	1
But	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
consulted,	1
and	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
disapprove,	1
opposition	1
then	1
becomes,	1
in	1
their	1
estimation,	1
an	1
indispensable	1
duty	1
of	1
self-love.	1
They	1
seem	1
to	1
think	1
themselves	1
bound	1
in	1
honor,	1
and	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
motives	1
of	1
personal	1
infallibility,	1
to	1
defeat	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
resolved	1
upon	1
contrary	1
to	1
their	1
sentiments.	1
Men	1
of	1
upright,	1
benevolent	1
tempers	1
have	1
too	1
many	1
opportunities	1
of	1
remarking,	1
with	1
horror,	1
to	1
what	1
desperate	1
lengths	1
this	1
disposition	1
is	1
sometimes	1
carried,	1
and	1
how	1
often	1
the	1
great	1
interests	1
of	1
society	1
are	1
sacrificed	1
to	1
the	1
vanity,	1
to	1
the	1
conceit,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
obstinacy	1
of	1
individuals,	1
who	1
have	1
credit	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
passions	1
and	1
their	1
caprices	1
interesting	1
to	1
mankind.	1
Perhaps	1
the	1
question	1
now	1
before	1
the	1
public	1
may,	1
in	1
its	1
consequences,	1
afford	1
melancholy	1
proofs	1
of	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
this	1
despicable	1
frailty,	1
or	1
rather	1
detestable	1
vice,	1
in	1
the	1
human	1
character.	1
Upon	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
a	1
free	1
government,	1
inconveniences	1
from	1
the	1
source	1
just	1
mentioned	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
submitted	1
to	1
in	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
the	1
legislature;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
unnecessary,	1
and	1
therefore	1
unwise,	1
to	1
introduce	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
Executive.	1
It	1
is	1
here	1
too	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
most	1
pernicious.	1
In	1
the	1
legislature,	1
promptitude	1
of	1
decision	1
is	1
oftener	1
an	1
evil	1
than	1
a	1
benefit.	1
The	1
differences	1
of	1
opinion,	1
and	1
the	1
jarrings	1
of	1
parties	1
in	1
that	1
department	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
though	1
they	1
may	1
sometimes	1
obstruct	1
salutary	1
plans,	1
yet	1
often	1
promote	1
deliberation	1
and	1
circumspection,	1
and	1
serve	1
to	1
check	1
excesses	1
in	1
the	1
majority.	1
When	1
a	1
resolution	1
too	1
is	1
once	1
taken,	1
the	1
opposition	1
must	1
be	1
at	1
an	1
end.	1
That	1
resolution	1
is	1
a	1
law,	1
and	1
resistance	1
to	1
it	1
punishable.	1
But	1
no	1
favorable	1
circumstances	1
palliate	1
or	1
atone	1
for	1
the	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
dissension	1
in	1
the	1
executive	1
department.	1
Here,	1
they	1
are	1
pure	1
and	1
unmixed.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
point	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
cease	1
to	1
operate.	1
They	1
serve	1
to	1
embarrass	1
and	1
weaken	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
or	1
measure	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
relate,	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
to	1
the	1
final	1
conclusion	1
of	1
it.	1
They	1
constantly	1
counteract	1
those	1
qualities	1
in	1
the	1
Executive	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
necessary	1
ingredients	1
in	1
its	1
composition,	1
vigor	1
and	1
expedition,	1
and	1
this	1
without	1
anycounterbalancing	1
good.	1
In	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
war,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
is	1
the	1
bulwark	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
security,	1
every	1
thing	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
be	1
apprehended	1
from	1
its	1
plurality.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
confessed	1
that	1
these	1
observations	1
apply	1
with	1
principal	1
weight	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
case	1
supposed	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
a	1
plurality	1
of	1
magistrates	1
of	1
equal	1
dignity	1
and	1
authority	1
a	1
scheme,	1
the	1
advocates	1
for	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
numerous	1
sect;	1
but	1
they	1
apply,	1
though	1
not	1
with	1
equal,	1
yet	1
with	1
considerable	1
weight	1
to	1
the	1
project	1
of	1
a	1
council,	1
whose	1
concurrence	1
is	1
made	1
constitutionally	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
the	1
ostensible	1
Executive.	1
An	1
artful	1
cabal	1
in	1
that	1
council	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
distract	1
and	1
to	1
enervate	1
the	1
whole	1
system	1
of	1
administration.	1
If	1
no	1
such	1
cabal	1
should	1
exist,	1
the	1
mere	1
diversity	1
of	1
views	1
and	1
opinions	1
would	1
alone	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
tincture	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
authority	1
with	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
habitual	1
feebleness	1
and	1
dilatoriness.	1
But	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
weightiest	1
objections	1
to	1
a	1
plurality	1
in	1
the	1
Executive,	1
and	1
which	1
lies	1
as	1
much	1
against	1
the	1
last	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
plan,	1
is,	1
that	1
it	1
tends	1
to	1
conceal	1
faults	1
and	1
destroy	1
responsibility.	1
Responsibility	1
is	1
of	1
two	1
kinds	1
to	1
censure	1
and	1
to	1
punishment.	1
The	1
first	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
important	1
of	1
the	1
two,	1
especially	1
in	1
an	1
elective	1
office.	1
Man,	1
in	1
public	1
trust,	1
will	1
much	1
oftener	1
act	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
him	1
unworthy	1
of	1
being	1
any	1
longer	1
trusted,	1
than	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
obnoxious	1
to	1
legal	1
punishment.	1
But	1
the	1
multiplication	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
adds	1
to	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
detection	1
in	1
either	1
case.	1
It	1
often	1
becomes	1
impossible,	1
amidst	1
mutual	1
accusations,	1
to	1
determine	1
on	1
whom	1
the	1
blame	1
or	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
a	1
pernicious	1
measure,	1
or	1
series	1
of	1
pernicious	1
measures,	1
ought	1
really	1
to	1
fall.	1
It	1
is	1
shifted	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
dexterity,	1
and	1
under	1
such	1
plausible	1
appearances,	1
that	1
the	1
public	1
opinion	1
is	1
left	1
in	1
suspense	1
about	1
the	1
real	1
author.	1
The	1
circumstances	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
led	1
to	1
any	1
national	1
miscarriage	1
or	1
misfortune	1
are	1
sometimes	1
so	1
complicated	1
that,	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
actors	1
who	1
may	1
have	1
had	1
different	1
degrees	1
and	1
kinds	1
of	1
agency,	1
though	1
we	1
may	1
clearly	1
see	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
that	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
mismanagement,	1
yet	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
impracticable	1
to	1
pronounce	1
to	1
whose	1
account	1
the	1
evil	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
incurred	1
is	1
truly	1
chargeable.	1
"I	1
was	1
overruled	1
by	1
my	1
council.	1
The	1
council	1
were	1
so	1
divided	1
in	1
their	1
opinions	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
obtain	1
any	1
better	1
resolution	1
on	1
the	1
point."	1
These	1
and	1
similar	1
pretexts	1
are	1
constantly	1
at	1
hand,	1
whether	1
true	1
or	1
false.	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
will	1
either	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
or	1
incur	1
the	1
odium,	1
of	1
a	1
strict	1
scrunity	1
into	1
the	1
secret	1
springs	1
of	1
the	1
transaction?	1
Should	1
there	1
be	1
found	1
a	1
citizen	1
zealous	1
enough	1
to	1
undertake	1
the	1
unpromising	1
task,	1
if	1
there	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
collusion	1
between	1
the	1
parties	1
concerned,	1
how	1
easy	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
clothe	1
the	1
circumstances	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
ambiguity,	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
it	1
uncertain	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
precise	1
conduct	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
parties?	1
In	1
the	1
single	1
instance	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
this	1
State	1
is	1
coupled	1
with	1
a	1
council	1
that	1
is,	1
in	1
the	1
appointment	1
to	1
offices,	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
mischiefs	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
view	1
now	1
under	1
consideration.	1
Scandalous	1
appointments	1
to	1
important	1
offices	1
have	1
been	1
made.	1
Some	1
cases,	1
indeed,	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
flagrant	1
that	1
ALL	1
PARTIES	1
have	1
agreed	1
in	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
the	1
thing.	1
When	1
inquiry	1
has	1
been	1
made,	1
the	1
blame	1
has	1
been	1
laid	1
by	1
the	1
governor	1
on	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
council,	1
who,	1
on	1
their	1
part,	1
have	1
charged	1
it	1
upon	1
his	1
nomination;	1
while	1
the	1
people	1
remain	1
altogether	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
determine,	1
by	1
whose	1
influence	1
their	1
interests	1
have	1
been	1
committed	1
to	1
hands	1
so	1
unqualified	1
and	1
so	1
manifestly	1
improper.	1
In	1
tenderness	1
to	1
individuals,	1
I	1
forbear	1
to	1
descend	1
to	1
particulars.	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
from	1
these	1
considerations,	1
that	1
the	1
plurality	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
tends	1
to	1
deprive	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
greatest	1
securities	1
they	1
can	1
have	1
for	1
the	1
faithful	1
exercise	1
of	1
any	1
delegated	1
power,	1
first,	1
the	1
restraints	1
of	1
public	1
opinion,	1
which	1
lose	1
their	1
efficacy,	1
as	1
well	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
censure	1
attendant	1
on	1
bad	1
measures	1
among	1
a	1
number,	1
as	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
uncertainty	1
on	1
whom	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
fall;	1
and,	1
secondly,	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
discovering	1
with	1
facility	1
and	1
clearness	1
the	1
misconduct	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
they	1
trust,	1
in	1
order	1
either	1
to	1
their	1
removal	1
from	1
office	1
or	1
to	1
their	1
actual	1
punishment	1
in	1
cases	1
which	1
admit	1
of	1
it.	1
In	1
England,	1
the	1
king	1
is	1
a	1
perpetual	1
magistrate;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
maxim	1
which	1
has	1
obtained	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
pub	1
lic	1
peace,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
unaccountable	1
for	1
his	1
administration,	1
and	1
his	1
person	1
sacred.	1
Nothing,	1
therefore,	1
can	1
be	1
wiser	1
in	1
that	1
kingdom,	1
than	1
to	1
annex	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
a	1
constitutional	1
council,	1
who	1
may	1
be	1
responsible	1
to	1
the	1
nation	1
for	1
the	1
advice	1
they	1
give.	1
Without	1
this,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
responsibility	1
whatever	1
in	1
the	1
executive	1
department	1
an	1
idea	1
inadmissible	1
in	1
a	1
free	1
government.	1
But	1
even	1
there	1
the	1
king	1
is	1
not	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
resolutions	1
of	1
his	1
council,	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
answerable	1
for	1
the	1
advice	1
they	1
give.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
absolute	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
conduct	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
his	1
office,	1
and	1
may	1
observe	1
or	1
disregard	1
the	1
counsel	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
sole	1
discretion.	1
But	1
in	1
a	1
republic,	1
where	1
every	1
magistrate	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
personally	1
responsible	1
for	1
his	1
behavior	1
in	1
office	1
the	1
reason	1
which	1
in	1
the	1
British	1
Constitution	1
dictates	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
a	1
council,	1
not	1
only	1
ceases	1
to	1
apply,	1
but	1
turns	1
against	1
the	1
institution.	1
In	1
the	1
monarchy	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
it	1
furnishes	1
a	1
substitute	1
for	1
the	1
prohibited	1
responsibility	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate,	1
which	1
serves	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
as	1
a	1
hostage	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
justice	1
for	1
his	1
good	1
behavior.	1
In	1
the	1
American	1
republic,	1
it	1
would	1
serve	1
to	1
destroy,	1
or	1
would	1
greatly	1
diminish,	1
the	1
intended	1
and	1
necessary	1
responsibility	1
of	1
the	1
Chief	1
Magistrate	1
himself.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
council	1
to	1
the	1
Executive,	1
which	1
has	1
so	1
generally	1
obtained	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
has	1
been	1
derived	1
from	1
that	1
maxim	1
of	1
republican	1
jealousy	1
which	1
considers	1
power	1
as	1
safer	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
than	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
man.	1
If	1
the	1
maxim	1
should	1
be	1
admitted	1
to	1
be	1
applicable	1
to	1
the	1
case,	1
I	1
should	1
contend	1
that	1
the	1
advantage	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
would	1
not	1
counterbalance	1
the	1
numerous	1
disadvantages	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side.	1
But	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
the	1
rule	1
at	1
all	1
applicable	1
to	1
the	1
executive	1
power.	1
I	1
clearly	1
concur	1
in	1
opinion,	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
with	1
a	1
writer	1
whom	1
the	1
celebrated	1
Junius	1
pronounces	1
to	1
be	1
"deep,	1
solid,	1
and	1
ingenious,"	1
that	1
"the	1
executive	1
power	1
is	1
more	1
easily	1
confined	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
ONE";2	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
far	1
more	1
safe	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
single	1
object	1
for	1
the	1
jealousy	1
and	1
watchfulness	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
and,	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
that	1
all	1
multiplication	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
is	1
rather	1
dangerous	1
than	1
friendly	1
to	1
liberty.	1
A	1
little	1
consideration	1
will	1
satisfy	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
species	1
of	1
security	1
sought	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
multiplication	1
of	1
the	1
Executive,	1
is	1
nattainable.	1
Numbers	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
great	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
combination	1
difficult,	1
or	1
they	1
are	1
rather	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
danger	1
than	1
of	1
security.	1
The	1
united	1
credit	1
and	1
influence	1
of	1
several	1
individuals	1
must	1
be	1
more	1
formidable	1
to	1
liberty,	1
than	1
the	1
credit	1
and	1
influence	1
of	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
separately.	1
When	1
power,	1
therefore,	1
is	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men,	1
as	1
to	1
admit	1
of	1
their	1
interests	1
and	1
views	1
being	1
easily	1
combined	1
in	1
a	1
common	1
enterprise,	1
by	1
an	1
artful	1
leader,	1
it	1
becomes	1
more	1
liable	1
to	1
abuse,	1
and	1
more	1
dangerous	1
when	1
abused,	1
than	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
one	1
man;	1
who,	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
circumstance	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
alone,	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
narrowly	1
watched	1
and	1
more	1
readily	1
suspected,	1
and	1
who	1
cannot	1
unite	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
influence	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
associated	1
with	1
others.	1
The	1
Decemvirs	1
of	1
Rome,	1
whose	1
name	1
denotes	1
their	1
number,3	1
were	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
dreaded	1
in	1
their	1
usurpation	1
than	1
any	1
ONE	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
have	1
been.	1
No	1
person	1
would	1
think	1
of	1
proposing	1
an	1
Executive	1
much	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
that	1
body;	1
from	1
six	1
to	1
a	1
dozen	1
have	1
been	1
suggested	1
for	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
council.	1
The	1
extreme	1
of	1
these	1
numbers,	1
is	1
not	1
too	1
great	1
for	1
an	1
easy	1
combination;	1
and	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
combination	1
America	1
would	1
have	1
more	1
to	1
fear,	1
than	1
from	1
the	1
ambition	1
of	1
any	1
single	1
individual.	1
A	1
council	1
to	1
a	1
magistrate,	1
who	1
is	1
himself	1
responsible	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
does,	1
are	1
generally	1
nothing	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
clog	1
upon	1
his	1
good	1
intentions,	1
are	1
often	1
the	1
instruments	1
and	1
accomplices	1
of	1
his	1
bad	1
and	1
are	1
almost	1
always	1
a	1
cloak	1
to	1
his	1
faults.	1
I	1
forbear	1
to	1
dwell	1
upon	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
expense;	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
evident	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
council	1
should	1
be	1
numerous	1
enough	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
principal	1
end	1
aimed	1
at	1
by	1
the	1
institution,	1
the	1
salaries	1
of	1
the	1
members,	1
who	1
must	1
be	1
drawn	1
from	1
their	1
homes	1
to	1
reside	1
at	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
government,	1
would	1
form	1
an	1
item	1
in	1
the	1
catalogue	1
of	1
public	1
expenditures	1
too	1
serious	1
to	1
be	1
incurred	1
for	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
equivocal	1
utility.	1
I	1
will	1
only	1
add	1
that,	1
prior	1
to	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
I	1
rarely	1
met	1
with	1
an	1
intelligent	1
man	1
from	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
admit,	1
as	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
experience,	1
that	1
the	1
UNITY	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
of	1
this	1
State	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
distinguishing	1
features	1
of	1
our	1
constitution.	1
PUBLIUS.	1
1	1
New	1

has	1
no	1

except	1
for	1
the	1
single	1
purpose	1
of	1
appointing	1
to	1
offices;	1
New	1
Jersey	1
has	1
a	1
council	1
whom	1
the	1
governor	1
may	1
consult.	1
But	1
I	1
think,	1
from	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
constitution,	1
their	1
resolutions	1
do	1
not	1
bind	1
him.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
DURATION	1
in	1
office	1
has	1
been	1
mentioned	1
as	1
the	1
second	1
requisite	1
to	1
the	1
energy	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
authority.	1
This	1
has	1
relation	1
to	1
two	1
objects:	1
to	1
the	1
personal	1
firmness	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate,	1
in	1
the	1
employment	1
of	1
his	1
constitutional	1
powers;	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
stability	1
of	1
the	1
system	1
of	1
administration	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
adopted	1
under	1
his	1
auspices.	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
first,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
evident,	1
that	1
the	1
longer	1
the	1
duration	1
in	1
office,	1
the	1
greater	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
obtaining	1
so	1
important	1
an	1
advantage.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
general	1
principle	1
of	1
human	1
nature,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
will	1
be	1
interested	1
in	1
whatever	1
he	1
possesses,	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
firmness	1
or	1
precariousness	1
of	1
the	1
tenure	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
holds	1
it;	1
will	1
be	1
less	1
attached	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
holds	1
by	1
a	1
momentary	1
or	1
uncertain	1
title,	1
than	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
enjoys	1
by	1
a	1
durable	1
or	1
certain	1
title;	1
and,	1
of	1
course,	1
will	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
risk	1
more	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
one,	1
than	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
This	1
remark	1
is	1
not	1
less	1
applicable	1
to	1
a	1
political	1
privilege,	1
or	1
honor,	1
or	1
trust,	1
than	1
to	1
any	1
article	1
of	1
ordinary	1
property.	1
The	1
inference	1
from	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
acting	1
in	1
the	1
capacity	1
of	1
chief	1
magistrate,	1
under	1
a	1
consciousness	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
time	1
he	1
MUST	1
lay	1
down	1
his	1
office,	1
will	1
be	1
apt	1
to	1
feel	1
himself	1
too	1
little	1
interested	1
in	1
it	1
to	1
hazard	1
any	1
material	1
censure	1
or	1
perplexity,	1
from	1
the	1
independent	1
exertion	1
of	1
his	1
powers,	1
or	1
from	1
encountering	1
the	1
ill-humors,	1
however	1
transient,	1
which	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
prevail,	1
either	1
in	1
a	1
considerable	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
society	1
itself,	1
or	1
even	1
in	1
a	1
predominant	1
faction	1
in	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
If	1
the	1
case	1
should	1
only	1
be,	1
that	1
he	1
MIGHT	1
lay	1
it	1
down,	1
unless	1
continued	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
choice,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
desirous	1
of	1
being	1
continued,	1
his	1
wishes,	1
conspiring	1
with	1
his	1
fears,	1
would	1
tend	1
still	1
more	1
powerfully	1
to	1
corrupt	1
his	1
integrity,	1
or	1
debase	1
his	1
fortitude.	1
In	1
either	1
case,	1
feebleness	1
and	1
irresolution	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
characteristics	1
of	1
the	1
station.	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
inclined	1
to	1
regard	1
the	1
servile	1
pliancy	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
to	1
a	1
prevailing	1
current,	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
community	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
legislature,	1
as	1
its	1
best	1
recommendation.	1
But	1
such	1
men	1
entertain	1
very	1
crude	1
notions,	1
as	1
well	1
of	1
the	1
purposes	1
for	1
which	1
government	1
was	1
instituted,	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
means	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
public	1
happiness	1
may	1
be	1
promoted.	1
The	1
republican	1
principle	1
demands	1
that	1
the	1
deliberate	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
should	1
govern	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
intrust	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
their	1
affairs;	1
but	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
require	1
an	1
unqualified	1
complaisance	1
to	1
every	1
sudden	1
breeze	1
of	1
passion,	1
or	1
to	1
every	1
transient	1
impulse	1
which	1
the	1
people	1
may	1
receive	1
from	1
the	1
arts	1
of	1
men,	1
who	1
flatter	1
their	1
prejudices	1
to	1
betray	1
their	1
interests.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
just	1
observation,	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
commonly	1
INTEND	1
the	1
PUBLIC	1
GOOD.	1
This	1
often	1
applies	1
to	1
their	1
very	1
errors.	1
But	1
their	1
good	1
sense	1
would	1
despise	1
the	1
adulator	1
who	1
should	1
pretend	1
that	1
they	1
always	1
REASON	1
RIGHT	1
about	1
the	1
MEANS	1
of	1
promoting	1
it.	1
They	1
know	1
from	1
experience	1
that	1
they	1
sometimes	1
err;	1
and	1
the	1
wonder	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
so	1
seldom	1
err	1
as	1
they	1
do,	1
beset,	1
as	1
they	1
continually	1
are,	1
by	1
the	1
wiles	1
of	1
parasites	1
and	1
sycophants,	1
by	1
the	1
snares	1
of	1
the	1
ambitious,	1
the	1
avaricious,	1
the	1
desperate,	1
by	1
the	1
artifices	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
possess	1
their	1
confidence	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
deserve	1
it,	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
seek	1
to	1
possess	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
deserve	1
it.	1
When	1
occasions	1
present	1
themselves,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
at	1
variance	1
with	1
their	1
inclinations,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
the	1
persons	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
appointed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
guardians	1
of	1
those	1
interests,	1
to	1
withstand	1
the	1
temporary	1
delusion,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
time	1
and	1
opportunity	1
for	1
more	1
cool	1
and	1
sedate	1
reflection.	1
Instances	1
might	1
be	1
cited	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
conduct	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
has	1
saved	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
very	1
fatal	1
consequences	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
mistakes,	1
and	1
has	1
procured	1
lasting	1
monuments	1
of	1
their	1
gratitude	1
to	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
courage	1
and	1
magnanimity	1
enough	1
to	1
serve	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
peril	1
of	1
their	1
displeasure.	1
But	1
however	1
inclined	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
to	1
insist	1
upon	1
an	1
unbounded	1
complaisance	1
in	1
the	1
Executive	1
to	1
the	1
inclinations	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
we	1
can	1
with	1
no	1
propriety	1
contend	1
for	1
a	1
like	1
complaisance	1
to	1
the	1
humors	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
The	1
latter	1
may	1
sometimes	1
stand	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
former,	1
and	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
the	1
people	1
may	1
be	1
entirely	1
neutral.	1
In	1
either	1
supposition,	1
it	1
is	1
certainly	1
desirable	1
that	1
the	1
Executive	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
situation	1
to	1
dare	1
to	1
act	1
his	1
own	1
opinion	1
with	1
vigor	1
and	1
decision.	1
The	1
same	1
rule	1
which	1
teaches	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
a	1
partition	1
between	1
the	1
various	1
branches	1
of	1
power,	1
teaches	1
us	1
likewise	1
that	1
this	1
partition	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
contrived	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
the	1
one	1
independent	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
To	1
what	1
purpose	1
separate	1
the	1
executive	1
or	1
the	1
judiciary	1
from	1
the	1
legislative,	1
if	1
both	1
the	1
executive	1
and	1
the	1
judiciary	1
are	1
so	1
constituted	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
absolute	1
devotion	1
of	1
the	1
legislative?	1
Such	1
a	1
separation	1
must	1
be	1
merely	1
nominal,	1
and	1
incapable	1
of	1
producing	1
the	1
ends	1
for	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
established.	1
It	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
subordinate	1
to	1
the	1
laws,	1
and	1
another	1
to	1
be	1
dependent	1
on	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
The	1
first	1
comports	1
with,	1
the	1
last	1
violates,	1
the	1
fundamental	1
principles	1
of	1
good	1
government;	1
and,	1
whatever	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
unites	1
all	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
hands.	1
The	1
tendency	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority	1
to	1
absorb	1
every	1
other,	1
has	1
been	1
fully	1
displayed	1
and	1
illustrated	1
by	1
examples	1
in	1
some	1
preceding	1
numbers.	1
In	1
governments	1
purely	1
republican,	1
this	1
tendency	1
is	1
almost	1
irresistible.	1
The	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
in	1
a	1
popular	1
assembly,	1
seem	1
sometimes	1
to	1
fancy	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
people	1
themselves,	1
and	1
betray	1
strong	1
symptoms	1
of	1
impatience	1
and	1
disgust	1
at	1
the	1
least	1
sign	1
of	1
opposition	1
from	1
any	1
other	1
quarter;	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
its	1
rights,	1
by	1
either	1
the	1
executive	1
or	1
judiciary,	1
were	1
a	1
breach	1
of	1
their	1
privilege	1
and	1
an	1
outrage	1
to	1
their	1
dignity.	1
They	1
often	1
appear	1
disposed	1
to	1
exert	1
an	1
imperious	1
control	1
over	1
the	1
other	1
departments;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
commonly	1
have	1
the	1
people	1
on	1
their	1
side,	1
they	1
always	1
act	1
with	1
such	1
momentum	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
very	1
difficult	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
It	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
asked,	1
how	1
the	1
shortness	1
of	1
the	1
duration	1
in	1
office	1
can	1
affect	1
the	1
independence	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
on	1
the	1
legislature,	1
unless	1
the	1
one	1
were	1
possessed	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
appointing	1
or	1
displacing	1
the	1
other.	1
One	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
inquiry	1
may	1
be	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
principle	1
already	1
remarked	1
that	1
is,	1
from	1
the	1
slender	1
interest	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
a	1
short-lived	1
advantage,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
inducement	1
it	1
affords	1
him	1
to	1
expose	1
himself,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
it,	1
to	1
any	1
considerable	1
inconvenience	1
or	1
hazard.	1
Another	1
answer,	1
perhaps	1
more	1
obvious,	1
though	1
not	1
more	1
conclusive,	1
will	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body	1
over	1
the	1
people;	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
employed	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
re-election	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
who,	1
by	1
an	1
upright	1
resistance	1
to	1
any	1
sinister	1
project	1
of	1
that	1
body,	1
should	1
have	1
made	1
himself	1
obnoxious	1
to	1
its	1
resentment.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
asked	1
also,	1
whether	1
a	1
duration	1
of	1
four	1
years	1
would	1
answer	1
the	1
end	1
proposed;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
would	1
not,	1
whether	1
a	1
less	1
period,	1
which	1
would	1
at	1
least	1
be	1
recommended	1
by	1
greater	1
security	1
against	1
ambitious	1
designs,	1
would	1
not,	1
for	1
that	1
reason,	1
be	1
preferable	1
to	1
a	1
longer	1
period,	1
which	1
was,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
too	1
short	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
inspiring	1
the	1
desired	1
firmness	1
and	1
independence	1
of	1
the	1
magistrate.	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
affirmed,	1
that	1
a	1
duration	1
of	1
four	1
years,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
limited	1
duration,	1
would	1
completely	1
answer	1
the	1
end	1
proposed;	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
contribute	1
towards	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
degree	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
material	1
influence	1
upon	1
the	1
spirit	1
and	1
character	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
Between	1
the	1
commencement	1
and	1
termination	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
period,	1
there	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
a	1
considerable	1
interval,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
annihilation	1
would	1
be	1
sufficiently	1
remote,	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
improper	1
effect	1
upon	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
indued	1
with	1
a	1
tolerable	1
portion	1
of	1
fortitude;	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
might	1
reasonably	1
promise	1
himself,	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
time	1
enough	1
before	1
it	1
arrived,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
community	1
sensible	1
of	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
the	1
measures	1
he	1
might	1
incline	1
to	1
pursue.	1
Though	1
it	1
be	1
probable	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
public	1
were,	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
election,	1
to	1
signify	1
their	1
sense	1
of	1
his	1
conduct,	1
his	1
confidence,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
his	1
firmness,	1
would	1
decline;	1
yet	1
both	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
would	1
derive	1
support	1
from	1
the	1
opportunities	1
which	1
his	1
previous	1
continuance	1
in	1
the	1
station	1
had	1
afforded	1
him,	1
of	1
establishing	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
esteem	1
and	1
good-will	1
of	1
his	1
constituents.	1
He	1
might,	1
then,	1
hazard	1
with	1
safety,	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
proofs	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
of	1
his	1
wisdom	1
and	1
integrity,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
title	1
he	1
had	1
acquired	1
to	1
the	1
respect	1
and	1
attachment	1
of	1
his	1
fellow-citizens.	1
As,	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
a	1
duration	1
of	1
four	1
years	1
will	1
contribute	1
to	1
the	1
firmness	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
in	1
a	1
sufficient	1
degree	1
to	1
render	1
it	1
a	1
very	1
valuable	1
ingredient	1
in	1
the	1
composition;	1
so,	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
enough	1
to	1
justify	1
any	1
alarm	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
liberty.	1
If	1
a	1
British	1
House	1
of	1
Commons,	1
from	1
the	1
most	1
feeble	1
beginnings,	1

have,	1
by	1

reduced	1
the	1

and	1

conceived	1
to	1
be	1

of	1
a	1
free	1

they	1
raised	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
rank	1
and	1
consequence	1
of	1
a	1
coequal	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature;	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
able,	1
in	1
one	1
instance,	1
to	1
abolish	1
both	1
the	1
royalty	1
and	1
the	1
aristocracy,	1
and	1
to	1
overturn	1
all	1
the	1
ancient	1
establishments,	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
Church	1
as	1
State;	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
able,	1
on	1
a	1
recent	1
occasion,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
monarch	1
tremble	1
at	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
an	1
innovation1	1
attempted	1
by	1
them,	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
be	1
feared	1
from	1
an	1
elective	1
magistrate	1
of	1
four	1
years'	1
duration,	1
with	1
the	1
confined	1
authorities	1
of	1
a	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1

What,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
unequal	1
to	1
the	1
task	1
which	1
the	1
Constitution	1
assigns	1
him?	1
I	1
shall	1
only	1
add,	1
that	1
if	1
his	1
duration	1
be	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
his	1
firmness,	1
that	1
doubt	1
is	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
a	1
jealousy	1
of	1
his	1
encroachments.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
administration	1
of	1
government,	1
in	1
its	1
largest	1
sense,	1
comprehends	1
all	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
politic,	1
whether	1
legislative,	1
executive,	1
or	1
judiciary;	1
but	1
in	1
its	1
most	1
usual,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
its	1
most	1
precise	1
signification.	1
It	1
is	1
limited	1
to	1
executive	1
details,	1
and	1
falls	1
peculiarly	1
within	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
department.	1
The	1
actual	1
conduct	1
of	1
foreign	1
negotiations,	1
the	1
preparatory	1
plans	1
of	1
finance,	1
the	1
application	1
and	1
disbursement	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
moneys	1
in	1
conformity	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
appropriations	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
navy,	1
the	1
directions	1
of	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
war,	1
these,	1
and	1
other	1
matters	1
of	1
a	1
like	1
nature,	1
constitute	1
what	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
most	1
properly	1
understood	1
by	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
government.	1
The	1
persons,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
whose	1
immediate	1
management	1
these	1
different	1
matters	1
are	1
committed,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
the	1
assistants	1
or	1
deputies	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate,	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
account,	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
derive	1
their	1
offices	1
from	1
his	1
appointment,	1
at	1
least	1
from	1
his	1
nomination,	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
his	1
superintendence.	1
This	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
will	1
at	1
once	1
suggest	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
intimate	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate	1
in	1
office	1
and	1
the	1
stability	1
of	1
the	1
system	1
of	1
administration.	1
To	1
reverse	1
and	1
undo	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
a	1
predecessor,	1
is	1
very	1
often	1
considered	1
by	1
a	1
successor	1
as	1
the	1
best	1
proof	1
he	1
can	1
give	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
capacity	1
and	1
desert;	1
and	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
this	1
propensity,	1
where	1
the	1
alteration	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
public	1
choice,	1
the	1
person	1
substituted	1
is	1
warranted	1
in	1
supposing	1
that	1
the	1
dismission	1
of	1
his	1
predecessor	1
has	1
proceeded	1
from	1
a	1
dislike	1
to	1
his	1
measures;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
less	1
he	1
resembles	1
him,	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
will	1
recommend	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
favor	1
of	1
his	1
constituents.	1
These	1
considerations,	1
and	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
personal	1
confidences	1
and	1
attachments,	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
induce	1
every	1
new	1
President	1
to	1
promote	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
men	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
subordinate	1
stations;	1
and	1
these	1
causes	1
together	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
occasion	1
a	1
disgraceful	1
and	1
ruinous	1
mutability	1
in	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
With	1
a	1
positive	1
duration	1
of	1
considerable	1
extent,	1
I	1
connect	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
re-eligibility.	1
The	1
first	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
officer	1
himself	1
the	1
inclination	1
and	1
the	1
resolution	1
to	1
act	1
his	1
part	1
well,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
community	1
time	1
and	1
leisure	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
tendency	1
of	1
his	1
measures,	1
and	1
thence	1
to	1
form	1
an	1
experimental	1
estimate	1
of	1
their	1
merits.	1
The	1
last	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
enable	1
the	1
people,	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
reason	1
to	1
approve	1
of	1
his	1
conduct,	1
to	1
continue	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
station,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
prolong	1
the	1
utility	1
of	1
his	1
talents	1
and	1
virtues,	1
and	1
to	1
secure	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
permanency	1
in	1
a	1
wise	1
system	1
of	1
administration.	1
Nothing	1
appears	1
more	1
plausible	1
at	1
first	1
sight,	1
nor	1
more	1
ill-founded	1
upon	1
close	1
inspection,	1
than	1
a	1
scheme	1
which	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
point	1
has	1
had	1
some	1
respectable	1
advocates,	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
of	1
continuing	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate	1
in	1
office	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
time,	1
and	1
then	1
excluding	1
him	1
from	1
it,	1
either	1
for	1
a	1
limited	1
period	1
or	1
forever	1
after.	1
This	1
exclusion,	1
whether	1
temporary	1
or	1
perpetual,	1
would	1
have	1
nearly	1
the	1
same	1
effects,	1
and	1
these	1
effects	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
rather	1
pernicious	1
than	1
salutary.	1
One	1
ill	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
exclusion	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
diminution	1
of	1
the	1
inducements	1
to	1
good	1
behavior.	1
There	1
are	1
few	1
men	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
feel	1
much	1
less	1
zeal	1
in	1
the	1
discharge	1
of	1
a	1
duty	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
conscious	1
that	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
station	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
connected	1
must	1
be	1
relinquished	1
at	1
a	1
determinate	1
period,	1
than	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
permitted	1
to	1
entertain	1
a	1
hope	1
of	1
OBTAINING,	1
by	1
MERITING,	1
a	1
continuance	1
of	1
them.	1
This	1
position	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
disputed	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
admitted	1
that	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
reward	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
strongest	1
incentives	1
of	1
human	1
conduct;	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
security	1
for	1
the	1
fidelity	1
of	1
mankind	1
is	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
interests	1
coincide	1
with	1
their	1
duty.	1
Even	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
fame,	1
the	1
ruling	1
passion	1
of	1
the	1
noblest	1
minds,	1
which	1
would	1
prompt	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
plan	1
and	1
undertake	1
extensive	1
and	1
arduous	1
enterprises	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
benefit,	1
requiring	1
considerable	1
time	1
to	1
mature	1
and	1
perfect	1
them,	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
flatter	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
being	1
allowed	1
to	1
finish	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
begun,	1
would,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
deter	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
undertaking,	1
when	1
he	1
foresaw	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
quit	1
the	1
scene	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
accomplish	1
the	1
work,	1
and	1
must	1
commit	1
that,	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
reputation,	1
to	1
hands	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
unequal	1
or	1
unfriendly	1
to	1
the	1
task.	1
The	1
most	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
from	1
the	1
generality	1
of	1
men,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
situation,	1
is	1
the	1
negative	1
merit	1
of	1
not	1
doing	1
harm,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
positive	1
merit	1
of	1
doing	1
good.	1
Another	1
ill	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
exclusion	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
temptation	1
to	1
sordid	1
views,	1
to	1
peculation,	1
and,	1
in	1
some	1
instances,	1
to	1
usurpation.	1
An	1
avaricious	1
man,	1
who	1
might	1
happen	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
office,	1
looking	1
forward	1
to	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
must	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
yield	1
up	1
the	1
emoluments	1
he	1
enjoyed,	1
would	1
feel	1
a	1
propensity,	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
resisted	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
man,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
opportunity	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
while	1
it	1
lasted,	1
and	1
might	1
not	1
scruple	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
corrupt	1
expedients	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
harvest	1
as	1
abundant	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
transitory;	1
though	1
the	1
same	1
man,	1
probably,	1
with	1
a	1
different	1
prospect	1
before	1
him,	1
might	1
content	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
regular	1
perquisites	1
of	1
his	1
situation,	1
and	1
might	1
even	1
be	1
unwilling	1
to	1
risk	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
an	1
abuse	1
of	1
his	1
opportunities.	1
His	1
avarice	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
guard	1
upon	1
his	1
avarice.	1
Add	1
to	1
this	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
man	1
might	1
be	1
vain	1
or	1
ambitious,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
avaricious.	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
expect	1
to	1
prolong	1
his	1
honors	1
by	1
his	1
good	1
conduct,	1
he	1
might	1
hesitate	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
his	1
appetite	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
appetite	1
for	1
gain.	1
But	1
with	1
the	1
prospect	1
before	1
him	1
of	1
approaching	1
an	1
inevitable	1
annihilation,	1
his	1
avarice	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
victory	1
over	1
his	1
caution,	1
his	1
vanity,	1
or	1
his	1
ambition.	1
An	1
ambitious	1
man,	1
too,	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
his	1
country's	1
honors,	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
must	1
descend	1
from	1
the	1
exalted	1
eminence	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
reflected	1
that	1
no	1
exertion	1
of	1
merit	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
could	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
unwelcome	1
reverse;	1
such	1
a	1
man,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
situation,	1
would	1
be	1
much	1
more	1
violently	1
tempted	1
to	1
embrace	1
a	1
favorable	1
conjuncture	1
for	1
attempting	1
the	1
prolongation	1
of	1
his	1
power,	1
at	1
every	1
personal	1
hazard,	1
than	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
answering	1
the	1
same	1
end	1
by	1
doing	1
his	1
duty.	1
Would	1
it	1
promote	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
community,	1
or	1
the	1
stability	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
have	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
credit	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
raised	1
to	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
supreme	1
magistracy,	1
wandering	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
like	1
discontented	1
ghosts,	1
and	1
sighing	1
for	1
a	1
place	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
destined	1
never	1
more	1
to	1
possess?	1
A	1
third	1
ill	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
exclusion	1
would	1
be,	1
the	1
depriving	1
the	1
community	1
of	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
experience	1
gained	1
by	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
his	1
office.	1
That	1
experience	1
is	1
the	1
parent	1
of	1
wisdom,	1
is	1
an	1
adage	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
recognized	1
by	1
the	1
wisest	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
simplest	1
of	1
mankind.	1
What	1
more	1
desirable	1
or	1
more	1
essential	1
than	1
this	1
quality	1
in	1
the	1
governors	1
of	1
nations?	1
Where	1
more	1
desirable	1
or	1
more	1
essential	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
magistrate	1
of	1
a	1
nation?	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
wise	1
to	1
put	1
this	1
desirable	1
and	1
essential	1
quality	1
under	1
the	1
ban	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
and	1
to	1
declare	1
that	1
the	1
moment	1
it	1
is	1
acquired,	1
its	1
possessor	1
shall	1
be	1
compelled	1
to	1
abandon	1
the	1
station	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
acquired,	1
and	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
adapted?	1
This,	1
nevertheless,	1
is	1
the	1
precise	1
import	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
regulations	1
which	1
exclude	1
men	1
from	1
serving	1
their	1
country,	1
by	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
their	1
fellowcitizens,	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
by	1
a	1
course	1
of	1
service	1
fitted	1
themselves	1
for	1
doing	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
greater	1
degree	1
of	1
utility.	1
A	1
fourth	1
ill	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
exclusion	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
banishing	1
men	1
from	1
stations	1
in	1
which,	1
in	1
certain	1
emergencies	1
of	1
the	1
state,	1
their	1
presence	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
moment	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
interest	1
or	1
safety.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
nation	1
which	1
has	1
not,	1
at	1
one	1
period	1
or	1
another,	1
experienced	1
an	1
absolute	1
necessity	1
of	1
the	1
services	1
of	1
particular	1
men	1
in	1
particular	1
situations;	1
perhaps	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
strong	1
to	1
say,	1
to	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
its	1
political	1
existence.	1
How	1
unwise,	1
therefore,	1
must	1
be	1
every	1
such	1
self-denying	1
ordinance	1
as	1
serves	1
to	1
prohibit	1
a	1
nation	1
from	1
making	1
use	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
citizens	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
best	1
suited	1
to	1
its	1
exigencies	1
and	1
circumstances!	1
Without	1
supposing	1
the	1
personal	1
essentiality	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate,	1
at	1
the	1
breaking	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
war,	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
similar	1
crisis,	1
for	1
another,	1
even	1
of	1
equal	1
merit,	1
would	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
be	1
detrimental	1
to	1
the	1
community,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
substitute	1
inexperience	1
to	1
experience,	1
and	1
would	1
tend	1
to	1
unhinge	1
and	1
set	1
afloat	1
the	1
already	1
settled	1
train	1
of	1
the	1
administration.	1
A	1
fifth	1
ill	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
exclusion	1
would	1
be,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
operate	1
as	1
a	1
constitutional	1
interdiction	1
of	1
stability	1
in	1
the	1
administration.	1
By	1
NECESSITATING	1
a	1
change	1
of	1
men,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
office	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
it	1
would	1
necessitate	1
a	1
mutability	1
of	1
measures.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
generally	1
to	1
be	1
expected,	1
that	1
men	1
will	1
vary	1
and	1
measures	1
remain	1
uniform.	1
The	1
contrary	1
is	1
the	1
usual	1
course	1
of	1
things.	1
And	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
apprehensive	1
that	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
stability,	1
while	1
there	1
is	1
even	1
the	1
option	1
of	1
changing;	1
nor	1
need	1
we	1
desire	1
to	1
prohibit	1
the	1
people	1
from	1
continuing	1
their	1
confidence	1
where	1
they	1
think	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
safely	1
placed,	1
and	1
where,	1
by	1
constancy	1
on	1
their	1
part,	1
they	1
may	1
obviate	1
the	1
fatal	1
inconveniences	1
of	1
fluctuating	1
councils	1
and	1
a	1
variable	1
policy.	1
These	1
are	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
disadvantages	1
which	1
would	1
flow	1
from	1
the	1
principle	1
of	1
exclusion.	1
They	1
apply	1
most	1
forcibly	1
to	1
the	1
scheme	1
of	1
a	1
perpetual	1
exclusion;	1
but	1
when	1
we	1
consider	1
that	1
even	1
a	1
partial	1
exclusion	1
would	1
always	1
render	1
the	1
readmission	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
a	1
remote	1
and	1
precarious	1
object,	1
the	1
observations	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
will	1
apply	1
nearly	1
as	1
fully	1
to	1
one	1
case	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
What	1
are	1
the	1
advantages	1
promised	1
to	1
counterbalance	1
these	1
disadvantages?	1
They	1
are	1
represented	1
to	1
be:	1
1st,	1
greater	1
independence	1
in	1
the	1
magistrate;	1
2d,	1
greater	1
security	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
Unless	1
the	1
exclusion	1
be	1
perpetual,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
pretense	1
to	1
infer	1
the	1
first	1
advantage.	1
But	1
even	1
in	1
that	1
case,	1
may	1
he	1
have	1
no	1
object	1
beyond	1
his	1
present	1
station,	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
may	1
sacrifice	1
his	1
independence?	1
May	1
he	1
have	1
no	1
connections,	1
no	1
friends,	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
may	1
sacrifice	1
it?	1
May	1
he	1
not	1
be	1
less	1
willing	1
by	1
a	1
firm	1
conduct,	1
to	1
make	1
personal	1
enemies,	1
when	1
he	1
acts	1
under	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
a	1
time	1
is	1
fast	1
approaching,	1
on	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
not	1
only	1
MAY,	1
but	1
MUST,	1
be	1
exposed	1
to	1
their	1
resentments,	1
upon	1
an	1
equal,	1
perhaps	1
upon	1
an	1
inferior,	1
footing?	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
easy	1
point	1
to	1
determine	1
whether	1
his	1
independence	1
would	1
be	1
most	1
promoted	1
or	1
impaired	1
by	1
such	1
an	1
arrangement.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
second	1
supposed	1
advantage,	1
there	1
is	1
still	1
greater	1
reason	1
to	1
entertain	1
doubts	1
concerning	1
it.	1
If	1
the	1
exclusion	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
perpetual,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
irregular	1
ambition,	1
of	1
whom	1
alone	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
reason	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
to	1
entertain	1
apprehension,	1
would,	1
with	1
infinite	1
reluctance,	1
yield	1
to	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
taking	1
his	1
leave	1
forever	1
of	1
a	1
post	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
passion	1
for	1
power	1
and	1
pre-eminence	1
had	1
acquired	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
habit.	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
fortunate	1
or	1
adroit	1
enough	1
to	1
conciliate	1
the	1
good-will	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
he	1
might	1
induce	1
them	1
to	1
consider	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
odious	1
and	1
unjustifiable	1
restraint	1
upon	1
themselves,	1
a	1
provision	1
which	1
was	1
calculated	1
to	1
debar	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
giving	1
a	1
fresh	1
proof	1
of	1
their	1
attachment	1
to	1
a	1
favorite.	1
There	1
may	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
third	1
ingredient	1
towards	1
constituting	1
the	1
vigor	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
authority,	1
is	1
an	1
adequate	1
provision	1
for	1
its	1
support.	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
that,	1
without	1
proper	1
attention	1
to	1
this	1
article,	1
the	1
separation	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
from	1
the	1
legislative	1
department	1
would	1
be	1
merely	1
nominal	1
and	1
nugatory.	1
The	1
legislature,	1
with	1
a	1
discretionary	1
power	1
over	1
the	1
salary	1
and	1
emoluments	1
of	1
the	1
Chief	1
Magistrate,	1
could	1
render	1
him	1
as	1
obsequious	1
to	1
their	1
will	1
as	1
they	1
might	1
think	1
proper	1
to	1
make	1
him.	1
They	1
might,	1
in	1
most	1
cases,	1
either	1
reduce	1
him	1
by	1
famine,	1
or	1
tempt	1
him	1
by	1
largesses,	1
to	1
surrender	1
at	1
discretion	1
his	1
judgment	1
to	1
their	1
inclinations.	1
These	1
expressions,	1
taken	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
latitude	1
of	1
the	1
terms,	1
would	1
no	1
doubt	1
convey	1
more	1
than	1
is	1
intended.	1
There	1
are	1
men	1
who	1
could	1
neither	1
be	1
distressed	1
nor	1
won	1
into	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
their	1
duty;	1
but	1
this	1
stern	1
virtue	1
is	1
the	1
growth	1
of	1
few	1
soils;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
main	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
that	1
a	1
power	1
over	1
a	1
man's	1
support	1
is	1
a	1
power	1
over	1
his	1
will.	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
necessary	1
to	1
confirm	1
so	1
plain	1
a	1
truth	1
by	1
facts,	1
examples	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
wanting,	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
country,	1
of	1
the	1
intimidation	1
or	1
seduction	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
by	1
the	1
terrors	1
or	1
allurements	1
of	1
the	1
pecuniary	1
arrangements	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
easy,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
commend	1
too	1
highly	1
the	1
judicious	1
attention	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
paid	1
to	1
this	1
subject	1
in	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution.	1
It	1
is	1
there	1
provided	1
that	1
"The	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
shall,	1
at	1
stated	1
times,	1
receive	1
for	1
his	1
services	1
a	1
compensation	1
WHICH	1
SHALL	1
NEITHER	1
BE	1
INCREASED	1
NOR	1
DIMINISHED	1
DURING	1
THE	1
PERIOD	1
FOR	1
WHICH	1
HE	1
SHALL	1
HAVE	1
BEEN	1
ELECTED;	1
and	1
he	1
SHALL	1
NOT	1
RECEIVE	1
WITHIN	1
THAT	1
PERIOD	1
ANY	1
OTHER	1
EMOLUMENT	1
from	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
them."	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
imagine	1
any	1
provision	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
eligible	1
than	1
this.	1
The	1
legislature,	1
on	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
a	1
President,	1
is	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
to	1
declare	1
what	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
compensation	1
for	1
his	1
services	1
during	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
shall	1
have	1
been	1
elected.	1
This	1
done,	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
alter	1
it,	1
either	1
by	1
increase	1
or	1
diminution,	1
till	1
a	1
new	1
period	1
of	1
service	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
election	1
commences.	1
They	1
can	1
neither	1
weaken	1
his	1
fortitude	1
by	1
operating	1
on	1
his	1
necessities,	1
nor	1
corrupt	1
his	1
integrity	1
by	1
appealing	1
to	1
his	1
avarice.	1
Neither	1
the	1
Union,	1
nor	1
any	1
of	1
its	1
members,	1
will	1
be	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
give,	1
nor	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
receive,	1
any	1
other	1
emolument	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
determined	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
act.	1
He	1
can,	1
of	1
course,	1
have	1
no	1
pecuniary	1
inducement	1
to	1
renounce	1
or	1
desert	1
the	1
independence	1
intended	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
The	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
requisites	1
to	1
energy,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
enumerated,	1
are	1
competent	1
powers.	1
Let	1
us	1
proceed	1
to	1
consider	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
proposed	1
to	1
be	1
vested	1
in	1
the	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
offers	1
itself	1
to	1
our	1
observation,	1
is	1
the	1
qualified	1
negative	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
upon	1
the	1
acts	1
or	1
resolutions	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
houses	1
of	1
the	1
legislature;	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
his	1
power	1
of	1
returning	1
all	1
bills	1
with	1
objections,	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
preventing	1
their	1
becoming	1
laws,	1
unless	1
they	1
should	1
afterwards	1
be	1
ratified	1
by	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
component	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
The	1
propensity	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
department	1
to	1
intrude	1
upon	1
the	1
rights,	1
and	1
to	1
absorb	1
the	1
powers,	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
departments,	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
suggested	1
and	1
repeated;	1
the	1
insufficiency	1
of	1
a	1
mere	1
parchment	1
delineation	1
of	1
the	1
boundaries	1
of	1
each,	1
has	1
also	1
been	1
remarked	1
upon;	1
and	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
furnishing	1
each	1
with	1
constitutional	1
arms	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
defense,	1
has	1
been	1
inferred	1
and	1
proved.	1
From	1
these	1
clear	1
and	1
indubitable	1
principles	1
results	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
a	1
negative,	1
either	1
absolute	1
or	1
qualified,	1
in	1
the	1
Executive,	1
upon	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
branches.	1
Without	1
the	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
former	1
would	1
be	1
absolutely	1
unable	1
to	1
defend	1
himself	1
against	1
the	1
depredations	1
of	1
the	1
latter.	1
He	1
might	1
gradually	1
be	1
stripped	1
of	1
his	1
authorities	1
by	1
successive	1
resolutions,	1
or	1
annihilated	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
vote.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
mode	1
or	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
executive	1
powers	1
might	1
speedily	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
blended	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
hands.	1
If	1
even	1
no	1
propensity	1
had	1
ever	1
discovered	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
legislative	1
body	1
to	1
invade	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
Executive,	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
just	1
reasoning	1
and	1
theoretic	1
propriety	1
would	1
of	1
themselves	1
teach	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
but	1
ought	1
to	1
possess	1
a	1
constitutional	1
and	1
effectual	1
power	1
of	1
selfdefense.	1
But	1
the	1
power	1
in	1
question	1
has	1
a	1
further	1
use.	1
It	1
not	1
only	1
serves	1
as	1
a	1
shield	1
to	1
the	1
Executive,	1
but	1
it	1
furnishes	1
an	1
additional	1
security	1
against	1
the	1
enaction	1
of	1
improper	1
laws.	1
It	1
establishes	1
a	1
salutary	1
check	1
upon	1
the	1
legislative	1
body,	1
calculated	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
community	1
against	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
faction,	1
precipitancy,	1
or	1
of	1
any	1
impulse	1
unfriendly	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
good,	1
which	1
may	1
happen	1
to	1
influence	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
that	1
body.	1
The	1
propriety	1
of	1
a	1
negative	1
has,	1
upon	1
some	1
occasions,	1
been	1
combated	1
by	1
an	1
observation,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
presumed	1
a	1
single	1
man	1
would	1
possess	1
more	1
virtue	1
and	1
wisdom	1
than	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men;	1
and	1
that	1
unless	1
this	1
presumption	1
should	1
be	1
entertained,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
improper	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate	1
any	1
species	1
of	1
control	1
over	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
But	1
this	1
observation,	1
when	1
examined,	1
will	1
appear	1
rather	1
specious	1
than	1
solid.	1
The	1
propriety	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
does	1
not	1
turn	1
upon	1
the	1
supposition	1
of	1
superior	1
wisdom	1
or	1
virtue	1
in	1
the	1
Executive,	1
but	1
upon	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
the	1
legislature	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
infallible;	1
that	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
power	1
may	1
sometimes	1
betray	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
encroach	1
upon	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
other	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
government;	1
that	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
faction	1
may	1
sometimes	1
pervert	1
its	1
deliberations;	1
that	1
impressions	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
may	1
sometimes	1
hurry	1
it	1
into	1
measures	1
which	1
itself,	1
on	1
maturer	1
reflexion,	1
would	1
condemn.	1
The	1
primary	1
inducement	1
to	1
conferring	1
the	1
power	1
in	1
question	1
upon	1
the	1
Executive	1
is,	1
to	1
enable	1
him	1
to	1
defend	1
himself;	1
the	1
secondary	1
one	1
is	1
to	1
increase	1
the	1
chances	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
against	1
the	1
passing	1
of	1
bad	1
laws,	1
through	1
haste,	1
inadvertence,	1
or	1
design.	1
The	1
oftener	1
the	1
measure	1
is	1
brought	1
under	1
examination,	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
diversity	1
in	1
the	1
situations	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
examine	1
it,	1
the	1
less	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
those	1
errors	1
which	1
flow	1
from	1
want	1
of	1
due	1
deliberation,	1
or	1
of	1
those	1
missteps	1
which	1
proceed	1
from	1
the	1
contagion	1
of	1
some	1
common	1
passion	1
or	1
interest.	1
It	1
is	1
far	1
less	1
probable,	1
that	1
culpable	1
views	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
should	1
infect	1
all	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
and	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
object,	1
than	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
by	1
turns	1
govern	1
and	1
mislead	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
It	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
preventing	1
bad	1
laws	1
includes	1
that	1
of	1
preventing	1
good	1
ones;	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
used	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
purpose	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
But	1
this	1
objection	1
will	1
have	1
little	1
weight	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
can	1
properly	1
estimate	1
the	1
mischiefs	1
of	1
that	1
inconstancy	1
and	1
mutability	1
in	1
the	1
laws,	1
which	1
form	1
the	1
greatest	1
blemish	1
in	1
the	1
character	1
and	1
genius	1
of	1
our	1
governments.	1
They	1
will	1
consider	1
every	1
institution	1
calculated	1
to	1
restrain	1
the	1
excess	1
of	1
law-making,	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
any	1
given	1
period,	1
as	1
much	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
than	1
harm;	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
favorable	1
to	1
greater	1
stability	1
in	1
the	1
system	1
of	1
legislation.	1
The	1
injury	1
which	1
may	1
possibly	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
defeating	1
a	1
few	1
good	1
laws,	1
will	1
be	1
amply	1
compensated	1
by	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
preventing	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
bad	1
ones.	1
Nor	1
is	1
this	1
all.	1
The	1
superior	1
weight	1
and	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body	1
in	1
a	1
free	1
government,	1
and	1
the	1
hazard	1
to	1
the	1
Executive	1
in	1
a	1
trial	1
of	1
strength	1
with	1
that	1
body,	1
afford	1
a	1
satisfactory	1
security	1
that	1
the	1
negative	1
would	1
generally	1
be	1
employed	1
with	1
great	1
caution;	1
and	1
there	1
would	1
oftener	1
be	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
charge	1
of	1
timidity	1
than	1
of	1
rashness	1
in	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
it.	1
A	1
king	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
train	1
of	1
sovereign	1
attributes,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
influence	1
he	1
draws	1
from	1
a	1
thousand	1
sources,	1
would,	1
at	1
this	1
day,	1
hesitate	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
negative	1
upon	1
the	1
joint	1
resolutions	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
houses	1
of	1
Parliament.	1
He	1
would	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
exert	1
the	1
utmost	1
resources	1
of	1
that	1
influence	1
to	1
strangle	1
a	1
measure	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
him,	1
in	1
its	1
progress	1
to	1
the	1
throne,	1
to	1
avoid	1
being	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
dilemma	1
of	1
permitting	1
it	1
to	1
take	1
effect,	1
or	1
of	1
risking	1
the	1
displeasure	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
by	1
an	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
Nor	1
is	1
it	1
probable,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
ultimately	1
venture	1
to	1
exert	1
his	1
prerogatives,	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
manifest	1
propriety,	1
or	1
extreme	1
necessity.	1
All	1
well-informed	1
men	1
in	1
that	1
kingdom	1
will	1
accede	1
to	1
the	1
justness	1
of	1
this	1
remark.	1
A	1
very	1
considerable	1
period	1
has	1
elapsed	1
since	1
the	1
negative	1
of	1
the	1
crown	1
has	1
been	1
exercised.	1
If	1
a	1
magistrate	1
so	1
powerful	1
and	1
so	1
well	1
fortified	1
as	1
a	1
British	1
monarch,	1
would	1
have	1
scruples	1
about	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
under	1
consideration,	1
how	1
much	1
greater	1
caution	1
may	1
be	1
reasonably	1
expected	1
in	1
a	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
clothed	1
for	1
the	1
short	1
period	1
of	1
four	1
years	1
with	1
the	1
executive	1
authority	1
of	1
a	1
government	1
wholly	1
and	1
purely	1
republican?	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
greater	1
danger	1
of	1
his	1
not	1
using	1
his	1
power	1
when	1
necessary,	1
than	1
of	1
his	1
using	1
it	1
too	1
often,	1
or	1
too	1
much.	1
An	1
argument,	1
indeed,	1
against	1
its	1
expediency,	1
has	1
been	1
drawn	1
from	1
this	1
very	1
source.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
represented,	1
on	1
this	1
account,	1
as	1
a	1
power	1
odious	1
in	1
appearance,	1
useless	1
in	1
practice.	1
But	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
follow,	1
that	1
because	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
rarely	1
exercised,	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
exercised.	1
In	1
the	1
case	1
for	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
chiefly	1
designed,	1
that	1
of	1
an	1
immediate	1
attack	1
upon	1
the	1
constitutional	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
Executive,	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
case	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
public	1
good	1
was	1
evidently	1
and	1
palpably	1
sacrificed,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
tolerable	1
firmness	1
would	1
avail	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
constitutional	1
means	1
of	1
defense,	1
and	1
would	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
admonitions	1
of	1
duty	1
and	1
responsibility.	1
In	1
the	1
former	1
supposition,	1
his	1
fortitude	1
would	1
be	1
stimulated	1
by	1
his	1
immediate	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
office;	1
in	1
the	1
latter,	1
by	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
the	1
sanction	1
of	1
his	1
constituents,	1
who,	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
naturally	1
incline	1
to	1
the	1
legislative	1
body	1
in	1
a	1
doubtful	1
case,	1
would	1
hardly	1
suffer	1
their	1
partiality	1
to	1
delude	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
plain	1
case.	1
I	1
speak	1
now	1
with	1
an	1
eye	1
to	1
a	1
magistrate	1
possessing	1
only	1
a	1
common	1
share	1
of	1
firmness.	1
There	1
are	1
men	1
who,	1
under	1
any	1
circumstances,	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
courage	1
to	1
do	1
their	1
duty	1
at	1
every	1
hazard.	1
But	1
the	1
convention	1
have	1
pursued	1
a	1
mean	1
in	1
this	1
business,	1
which	1
will	1
both	1
facilitate	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
vested	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
in	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate,	1
and	1
make	1
its	1
efficacy	1
to	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
a	1
considerable	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
Instead	1
of	1
an	1
absolute	1
negative,	1
it	1
is	1
proposed	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
Executive	1
the	1
qualified	1
negative	1
already	1
described.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
power	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
much	1
more	1
readily	1
exercised	1
than	1
the	1
other.	1
A	1
man	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
afraid	1
to	1
defeat	1
a	1
law	1
by	1
his	1
single	1
VETO,	1
might	1
not	1
scruple	1
to	1
return	1
it	1
for	1
reconsideration;	1
subject	1
to	1
being	1
finally	1
rejected	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
third	1
of	1
each	1
house	1
concurring	1
in	1
the	1
sufficiency	1
of	1
his	1
objections.	1
He	1
would	1
be	1
encouraged	1
by	1
the	1
reflection,	1
that	1
if	1
his	1
opposition	1
should	1
prevail,	1
it	1
would	1
embark	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
very	1
respectable	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body,	1
whose	1
influence	1
would	1
be	1
united	1
with	1
his	1
in	1
supporting	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
his	1
conduct	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
opinion.	1
A	1
direct	1
and	1
categorical	1
negative	1
has	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
it	1
more	1
harsh,	1
and	1
more	1
apt	1
to	1
irritate,	1
than	1
the	1
mere	1
suggestion	1
of	1
argumentative	1
objections	1
to	1
be	1
approved	1
or	1
disapproved	1
by	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
are	1
addressed.	1
In	1
proportion	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
less	1
apt	1
to	1
offend,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
exercised;	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
very	1
reason,	1
it	1
may	1
in	1
practice	1
be	1
found	1
more	1
effectual.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
hoped	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
often	1
happen	1
that	1
improper	1
views	1
will	1
govern	1
so	1
large	1
a	1
proportion	1
as	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
both	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time;	1
and	1
this,	1
too,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
counterposing	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
Executive.	1
It	1
is	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
far	1
less	1
probable	1
that	1
this	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
than	1
that	1
such	1
views	1
should	1
taint	1
the	1
resolutions	1
and	1
conduct	1
of	1
a	1
bare	1
majority.	1
A	1
power	1
of	1
this	1
nature	1
in	1
the	1
Executive,	1
will	1
often	1
have	1
a	1
silent	1
and	1
unperceived,	1
though	1
forcible,	1
operation.	1
When	1
men,	1
engaged	1
in	1
unjustifiable	1
pursuits,	1
are	1
aware	1
that	1
obstructions	1
may	1
come	1
from	1
a	1
quarter	1
which	1
they	1
cannot	1
control,	1
they	1
will	1
often	1
be	1
restrained	1
by	1
the	1
bare	1
apprehension	1
of	1
opposition,	1
from	1
doing	1
what	1
they	1
would	1
with	1
eagerness	1
rush	1
into,	1
if	1
no	1
such	1
external	1
impediments	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
feared.	1
This	1
qualified	1
negative,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
elsewhere	1
remarked,	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
State	1
vested	1
in	1
a	1
council,	1
consisting	1
of	1
the	1
governor,	1
with	1
the	1
chancellor	1
and	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court,	1
or	1
any	1
two	1
of	1
them.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
freely	1
employed	1
upon	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
occasions,	1
and	1
frequently	1
with	1
success.	1
And	1
its	1
utility	1
has	1
become	1
so	1
apparent,	1
that	1
persons	1
who,	1
in	1
compiling	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
were	1
violent	1
opposers	1
of	1
it,	1
have	1
from	1
experience	1
become	1
its	1
declared	1
admirers.1	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
another	1
place	1
remarked,	1
that	1
the	1
convention,	1
in	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
plan,	1
had	1
departed	1
from	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
this	1
State,	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
that	1
of	1
Massachusetts.	1
Two	1
strong	1
reasons	1
may	1
be	1
imagined	1
for	1
this	1
preference.	1
One	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
judges,	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
interpreters	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
might	1
receive	1
an	1
improper	1
bias,	1
from	1
having	1
given	1
a	1
previous	1
opinion	1
in	1
their	1
revisionary	1
capacities;	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
that	1
by	1
being	1
often	1
associated	1
with	1
the	1
Executive,	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
induced	1
to	1
embark	1
too	1
far	1
in	1
the	1
political	1
views	1
of	1
that	1
magistrate,	1
and	1
thus	1
a	1
dangerous	1
combination	1
might	1
by	1
degrees	1
be	1
cemented	1
between	1
the	1
executive	1
and	1
judiciary	1
departments.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
judges	1
too	1
distinct	1
from	1
every	1
other	1
avocation	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
expounding	1
the	1
laws.	1
It	1
is	1
peculiarly	1
dangerous	1
to	1
place	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
situation	1
to	1
be	1
either	1
corrupted	1
or	1
influenced	1
by	1
the	1
Executive.	1
PUBLIUS.	1
1	1
Mr.	1
Abraham	1
Yates,	1
a	1
warm	1
opponent	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
is	1
of	1
this	1
number.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
"commander-in-chief	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
and	1
navy	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
militia	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States	1
WHEN	1
CALLED	1
INTO	1
THE	1
ACTUAL	1
SERVICE	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States."	1
The	1
propriety	1
of	1
this	1
provision	1
is	1
so	1
evident	1
in	1
itself,	1
and	1
it	1
is,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
so	1
consonant	1
to	1
the	1
precedents	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
in	1
general,	1
that	1
little	1
need	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
explain	1
or	1
enforce	1
it.	1
Even	1
those	1
of	1
them	1
which	1
have,	1
in	1
other	1
respects,	1
coupled	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate	1
with	1
a	1
council,	1
have	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
concentrated	1
the	1
military	1
authority	1
in	1
him	1
alone.	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
cares	1
or	1
concerns	1
of	1
government,	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
war	1
most	1
peculiarly	1
demands	1
those	1
qualities	1
which	1
distinguish	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
power	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
hand.	1
The	1
direction	1
of	1
war	1
implies	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
strength;	1
and	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
directing	1
and	1
employing	1
the	1
common	1
strength,	1
forms	1
a	1
usual	1
and	1
essential	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
definition	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
authority.	1
"The	1
President	1
may	1
require	1
the	1
opinion,	1
in	1
writing,	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
officer	1
in	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
departments,	1
upon	1
any	1
subject	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
officers."	1
This	1
I	1
consider	1
as	1
a	1
mere	1
redundancy	1
in	1
the	1
plan,	1
as	1
the	1
right	1
for	1
which	1
it	1
provides	1
would	1
result	1
of	1
itself	1
from	1
the	1
office.	1
He	1
is	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
authorized	1
to	1
grant	1
"reprieves	1
and	1
pardons	1
for	1
offenses	1
against	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
EXCEPT	1
IN	1
CASES	1
OF	1
IMPEACHMENT."	1
Humanity	1
and	1
good	1
policy	1
conspire	1
to	1
dictate,	1
that	1
the	1
benign	1
prerogative	1
of	1
pardoning	1
should	1
be	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible	1
fettered	1
or	1
embarrassed.	1
The	1
criminal	1
code	1
of	1
every	1
country	1
partakes	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
necessary	1
severity,	1
that	1
without	1
an	1
easy	1
access	1
to	1
exceptions	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
unfortunate	1
guilt,	1
justice	1
would	1
wear	1
a	1
countenance	1
too	1
sanguinary	1
and	1
cruel.	1
As	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
responsibility	1
is	1
always	1
strongest,	1
in	1
proportion	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
undivided,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
inferred	1
that	1
a	1
single	1
man	1
would	1
be	1
most	1
ready	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
those	1
motives	1
which	1
might	1
plead	1
for	1
a	1
mitigation	1
of	1
the	1
rigor	1
of	1
the	1
law,	1
and	1
least	1
apt	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
considerations	1
which	1
were	1
calculated	1
to	1
shelter	1
a	1
fit	1
object	1
of	1
its	1
vengeance.	1
The	1
reflection	1
that	1
the	1
fate	1
of	1
a	1
fellow-creature	1
depended	1
on	1
his	1
sole	1
fiat,	1
would	1
naturally	1
inspire	1
scrupulousness	1
and	1
caution;	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
being	1
accused	1
of	1
weakness	1
or	1
connivance,	1
would	1
beget	1
equal	1
circumspection,	1
though	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
kind.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
as	1
men	1
generally	1
derive	1
confidence	1
from	1
their	1
numbers,	1
they	1
might	1
often	1
encourage	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
obduracy,	1
and	1
might	1
be	1
less	1
sensible	1
to	1
the	1
apprehension	1
of	1
suspicion	1
or	1
censure	1
for	1
an	1
injudicious	1
or	1
affected	1
clemency.	1
On	1
these	1
accounts,	1
one	1
man	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
more	1
eligible	1
dispenser	1
of	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
government,	1
than	1
a	1
body	1
of	1
men.	1
The	1
expediency	1
of	1
vesting	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
pardoning	1
in	1
the	1
President	1
has,	1
if	1
I	1
mistake	1
not,	1
been	1
only	1
contested	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
crime	1
of	1
treason.	1
This,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
urged,	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
depended	1
upon	1
the	1
assent	1
of	1
one,	1
or	1
both,	1
of	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
deny	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
strong	1
reasons	1
to	1
be	1
assigned	1
for	1
requiring	1
in	1
this	1
particular	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
that	1
body,	1
or	1
of	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
it.	1
As	1
treason	1
is	1
a	1
crime	1
levelled	1
at	1
the	1
immediate	1
being	1
of	1
the	1
society,	1
when	1
the	1
laws	1
have	1
once	1
ascertained	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
the	1
offender,	1
there	1
seems	1
a	1
fitness	1
in	1
referring	1
the	1
expediency	1
of	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
mercy	1
towards	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
And	1
this	1
ought	1
the	1
rather	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
as	1
the	1
supposition	1
of	1
the	1
connivance	1
of	1
the	1
Chief	1
Magistrate	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
excluded.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
also	1
strong	1
objections	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
plan.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
doubted,	1
that	1
a	1
single	1
man	1
of	1
prudence	1
and	1
good	1
sense	1
is	1
better	1
fitted,	1
in	1
delicate	1
conjunctures,	1
to	1
balance	1
the	1
motives	1
which	1
may	1
plead	1
for	1
and	1
against	1
the	1
remission	1
of	1
the	1
punishment,	1
than	1
any	1
numerous	1
body	1
whatever.	1
It	1
deserves	1
particular	1
attention,	1
that	1
treason	1
will	1
often	1
be	1
connected	1
with	1
seditions	1
which	1
embrace	1
a	1
large	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
community;	1
as	1
lately	1
happened	1
in	1
Massachusetts.	1
In	1
every	1
such	1
case,	1
we	1
might	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
tainted	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
spirit	1
which	1
had	1
given	1
birth	1
to	1
the	1
offense.	1
And	1
when	1
parties	1
were	1
pretty	1
equally	1
matched,	1
the	1
secret	1
sympathy	1
of	1
the	1
friends	1
and	1
favorers	1
of	1
the	1
condemned	1
person,	1
availing	1
itself	1
of	1
the	1
good-nature	1
and	1
weakness	1
of	1
others,	1
might	1
frequently	1
bestow	1
impunity	1
where	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
an	1
example	1
was	1
necessary.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
when	1
the	1
sedition	1
had	1
proceeded	1
from	1
causes	1
which	1
had	1
inflamed	1
the	1
resentments	1
of	1
the	1
major	1
party,	1
they	1
might	1
often	1
be	1
found	1
obstinate	1
and	1
inexorable,	1
when	1
policy	1
demanded	1
a	1
conduct	1
of	1
forbearance	1
and	1
clemency.	1
But	1
the	1
principal	1
argument	1
for	1
reposing	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
pardoning	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
to	1
the	1
Chief	1
Magistrate	1
is	1
this:	1
in	1
seasons	1
of	1
insurrection	1
or	1
rebellion,	1
there	1
are	1
often	1
critical	1
moments,	1
when	1
a	1
welltimed	1
offer	1
of	1
pardon	1
to	1
the	1
insurgents	1
or	1
rebels	1
may	1
restore	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
the	1
commonwealth;	1
and	1
which,	1
if	1
suffered	1
to	1
pass	1
unimproved,	1
it	1
may	1
never	1
be	1
possible	1
afterwards	1
to	1
recall.	1
The	1
dilatory	1
process	1
of	1
convening	1
the	1
legislature,	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
branches,	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
obtaining	1
its	1
sanction	1
to	1
the	1
measure,	1
would	1
frequently	1
be	1
the	1
occasion	1
of	1
letting	1
slip	1
the	1
golden	1
opportunity.	1
The	1
loss	1
of	1
a	1
week,	1
a	1
day,	1
an	1
hour,	1
may	1
sometimes	1
be	1
fatal.	1
If	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
observed,	1
that	1
a	1
discretionary	1
power,	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
such	1
contingencies,	1
might	1
be	1
occasionally	1
conferred	1
upon	1
the	1
President,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
questionable,	1
whether,	1
in	1
a	1
limited	1
Constitution,	1
that	1
power	1
could	1
be	1
delegated	1
by	1
law;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
place,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
generally	1
be	1
impolitic	1
beforehand	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
step	1
which	1
might	1
hold	1
out	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
impunity.	1
A	1
proceeding	1
of	1
this	1
kind,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
usual	1
course,	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
construed	1
into	1
an	1
argument	1
of	1
timidity	1
or	1
of	1
weakness,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
embolden	1
guilt.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
President	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
power,	1
"by	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
advice	1
and	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
to	1
make	1
treaties,	1
provided	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
senators	1
present	1
concur."	1
Though	1
this	1
provision	1
has	1
been	1
assailed,	1
on	1
different	1
grounds,	1
with	1
no	1
small	1
degree	1
of	1
vehemence,	1
I	1
scruple	1
not	1
to	1
declare	1
my	1
firm	1
persuasion,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
digested	1
and	1
most	1
unexceptionable	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
plan.	1
One	1
ground	1
of	1
objection	1
is	1
the	1
trite	1
topic	1
of	1
the	1
intermixture	1
of	1
powers;	1
some	1
contending	1
that	1
the	1
President	1
ought	1
alone	1
to	1
possess	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties;	1
others,	1
that	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
exclusively	1
deposited	1
in	1
the	1
Senate.	1
Another	1
source	1
of	1
objection	1
is	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
persons	1
by	1
whom	1
a	1
treaty	1
may	1
be	1
made.	1
Of	1
those	1
who	1
espouse	1
this	1
objection,	1
a	1
part	1
are	1
of	1
opinion	1
that	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
associated	1
in	1
the	1
business,	1
while	1
another	1
part	1
seem	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
nothing	1
more	1
was	1
necessary	1
than	1
to	1
have	1
substituted	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
ALL	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
to	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
PRESENT.	1
As	1
I	1
flatter	1
myself	1
the	1
observations	1
made	1
in	1
a	1
preceding	1
number	1
upon	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
must	1
have	1
sufficed	1
to	1
place	1
it,	1
to	1
a	1
discerning	1
eye,	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
favorable	1
light,	1
I	1
shall	1
here	1
content	1
myself	1
with	1
offering	1
only	1
some	1
supplementary	1
remarks,	1
principally	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
the	1
objections	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
just	1
stated.	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
intermixture	1
of	1
powers,	1
I	1
shall	1
rely	1
upon	1
the	1
explanations	1
already	1
given	1
in	1
other	1
places,	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
rule	1
upon	1
which	1
that	1
objection	1
is	1
founded;	1
and	1
shall	1
take	1
it	1
for	1
granted,	1
as	1
an	1
inference	1
from	1
them,	1
that	1
the	1
union	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
with	1
the	1
Senate,	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
treaties,	1
is	1
no	1
infringement	1
of	1
that	1
rule.	1
I	1
venture	1
to	1
add,	1
that	1
the	1
particular	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties	1
indicates	1
a	1
peculiar	1
propriety	1
in	1
that	1
union.	1
Though	1
several	1
writers	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
government	1
place	1
that	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
class	1
of	1
executive	1
authorities,	1
yet	1
this	1
is	1
evidently	1
an	1
arbitrary	1
disposition;	1
for	1
if	1
we	1
attend	1
carefully	1
to	1
its	1
operation,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
to	1
partake	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
character,	1
though	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
strictly	1
to	1
fall	1
within	1
the	1
definition	1
of	1
either	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
essence	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority	1
is	1
to	1
enact	1
laws,	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
to	1
prescribe	1
rules	1
for	1
the	1
regulation	1
of	1
the	1
society;	1
while	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
laws,	1
and	1
the	1
employment	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
strength,	1
either	1
for	1
this	1
purpose	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
defense,	1
seem	1
to	1
comprise	1
all	1
the	1
functions	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties	1
is,	1
plainly,	1
neither	1
the	1
one	1
nor	1
the	1
other.	1
It	1
relates	1
neither	1
to	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
subsisting	1
laws,	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
enaction	1
of	1
new	1
ones;	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
to	1
an	1
exertion	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
strength.	1
Its	1
objects	1
are	1
CONTRACTS	1
with	1
foreign	1
nations,	1
which	1
have	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
law,	1
but	1
derive	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
obligations	1
of	1
good	1
faith.	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
rules	1
prescribed	1
by	1
the	1
sovereign	1
to	1
the	1
subject,	1
but	1
agreements	1
between	1
sovereign	1
and	1
sovereign.	1
The	1
power	1
in	1
question	1
seems	1
therefore	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
distinct	1
department,	1
and	1
to	1
belong,	1
properly,	1
neither	1
to	1
the	1
legislative	1
nor	1
to	1
the	1
executive.	1
The	1
qualities	1
elsewhere	1
detailed	1
as	1
indispensable	1
in	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
foreign	1
negotiations,	1
point	1
out	1
the	1
Executive	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
fit	1
agent	1
in	1
those	1
transactions;	1
while	1
the	1
vast	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
trust,	1
and	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
treaties	1
as	1
laws,	1
plead	1
strongly	1
for	1
the	1
participation	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
or	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body	1
in	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
making	1
them.	1
However	1
proper	1
or	1
safe	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
governments	1
where	1
the	1
executive	1
magistrate	1
is	1
an	1
hereditary	1
monarch,	1
to	1
commit	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
entire	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
utterly	1
unsafe	1
and	1
improper	1
to	1
intrust	1
that	1
power	1
to	1
an	1
elective	1
magistrate	1
of	1
four	1
years'	1
duration.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
remarked,	1
upon	1
another	1
occasion,	1
and	1
the	1
remark	1
is	1
unquestionably	1
just,	1
that	1
an	1
hereditary	1
monarch,	1
though	1
often	1
the	1
oppressor	1
of	1
his	1
people,	1
has	1
personally	1
too	1
much	1
stake	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
material	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
corrupted	1
by	1
foreign	1
powers.	1
But	1
a	1
man	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
station	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
citizen	1
to	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
chief	1
magistrate,	1
possessed	1
of	1
a	1
moderate	1
or	1
slender	1
fortune,	1
and	1
looking	1
forward	1
to	1
a	1
period	1
not	1
very	1
remote	1
when	1
he	1
may	1
probably	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
station	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
taken,	1
might	1
sometimes	1
be	1
under	1
temptations	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
his	1
interest,	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
require	1
superlative	1
virtue	1
to	1
withstand.	1
An	1
avaricious	1
man	1
might	1
be	1
tempted	1
to	1
betray	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
to	1
the	1
acquisition	1
of	1
wealth.	1
An	1
ambitious	1
man	1
might	1
make	1
his	1
own	1
aggrandizement,	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
a	1
foreign	1
power,	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
his	1
treachery	1
to	1
his	1
constituents.	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
human	1
conduct	1
does	1
not	1
warrant	1
that	1
exalted	1
opinion	1
of	1
human	1
virtue	1
which	1
would	1
make	1
it	1
wise	1
in	1
a	1
nation	1
to	1
commit	1
interests	1
of	1
so	1
delicate	1
and	1
momentous	1
a	1
kind,	1
as	1
those	1
which	1
concern	1
its	1
intercourse	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
the	1
sole	1
disposal	1
of	1
a	1
magistrate	1
created	1
and	1
circumstanced	1
as	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
To	1
have	1
intrusted	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties	1
to	1
the	1
Senate	1
alone,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
relinquish	1
the	1
benefits	1
of	1
the	1
constitutional	1
agency	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
in	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
foreign	1
negotiations.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
Senate	1
would,	1
in	1
that	1
case,	1
have	1
the	1
option	1
of	1
employing	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
capacity,	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
also	1
have	1
the	1
option	1
of	1
letting	1
it	1
alone,	1
and	1
pique	1
or	1
cabal	1
might	1
induce	1
the	1
latter	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
former.	1
Besides	1
this,	1
the	1
ministerial	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
confidence	1
and	1
respect	1
of	1
foreign	1
powers	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
degree	1
with	1
the	1
constitutional	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
and,	1
of	1
course,	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
act	1
with	1
an	1
equal	1
degree	1
of	1
weight	1
or	1
efficacy.	1
While	1
the	1
Union	1
would,	1
from	1
this	1
cause,	1
lose	1
a	1
considerable	1
advantage	1
in	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
its	1
external	1
concerns,	1
the	1
people	1
would	1
lose	1
the	1
additional	1
security	1
which	1
would	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
co-operation	1
of	1
the	1
Executive.	1
Though	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
imprudent	1
to	1
confide	1
in	1
him	1
solely	1
so	1
important	1
a	1
trust,	1
yet	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
doubted	1
that	1
his	1
participation	1
would	1
materially	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
society.	1
It	1
must	1
indeed	1
be	1
clear	1
to	1
a	1
demonstration	1
that	1
the	1
joint	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
in	1
question,	1
by	1
the	1
President	1
and	1
Senate,	1
would	1
afford	1
a	1
greater	1
prospect	1
of	1
security,	1
than	1
the	1
separate	1
possession	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
either	1
of	1
them.	1
And	1
whoever	1
has	1
maturely	1
weighed	1
the	1
circumstances	1
which	1
must	1
concur	1
in	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
a	1
President,	1
will	1
be	1
satisfied	1
that	1
the	1
office	1
will	1
always	1
bid	1
fair	1
to	1
be	1
filled	1
by	1
men	1
of	1
such	1
characters	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
their	1
concurrence	1
in	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
treaties	1
peculiarly	1
desirable,	1
as	1
well	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
wisdom,	1
as	1
on	1
that	1
of	1
integrity.	1
The	1
remarks	1
made	1
in	1
a	1
former	1
number,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
alluded	1
to	1
in	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
paper,	1
will	1
apply	1
with	1
conclusive	1
force	1
against	1
the	1
admission	1
of	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
to	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
treaties.	1
The	1
fluctuating	1
and,	1
taking	1
its	1
future	1
increase	1
into	1
the	1
account,	1
the	1
multitudinous	1
composition	1
of	1
that	1
body,	1
forbid	1
us	1
to	1
expect	1
in	1
it	1
those	1
qualities	1
which	1
are	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
proper	1
execution	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
trust.	1
Accurate	1
and	1
comprehensive	1
knowledge	1
of	1
foreign	1
politics;	1
a	1
steady	1
and	1
systematic	1
adherence	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
views;	1
a	1
nice	1
and	1
uniform	1
sensibility	1
to	1
national	1
character;	1
decision,	1
SECRECY,	1
and	1
despatch,	1
are	1
incompatible	1
with	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
a	1
body	1
so	1
variable	1
and	1
so	1
numerous.	1
The	1
very	1
complication	1
of	1
the	1
business,	1
by	1
introducing	1
a	1
necessity	1
of	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
different	1
bodies,	1
would	1
of	1
itself	1
afford	1
a	1
solid	1
objection.	1
The	1
greater	1
frequency	1
of	1
the	1
calls	1
upon	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
and	1
the	1
greater	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
often	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
together	1
when	1
convened,	1
to	1
obtain	1
their	1
sanction	1
in	1
the	1
progressive	1
stages	1
of	1
a	1
treaty,	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
so	1
great	1
inconvenience	1
and	1
expense	1
as	1
alone	1
ought	1
to	1
condemn	1
the	1
project.	1
The	1
only	1
objection	1
which	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
canvassed,	1
is	1
that	1
which	1
would	1
substitute	1
the	1
proportion	1
of	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
composing	1
the	1
senatorial	1
body,	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
PRESENT.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
shown,	1
under	1
the	1
second	1
head	1
of	1
our	1
inquiries,	1
that	1
all	1
provisions	1
which	1
require	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
any	1
body	1
to	1
its	1
resolutions,	1
have	1
a	1
direct	1
tendency	1
to	1
embarrass	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
an	1
indirect	1
one	1
to	1
subject	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
majority	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
minority.	1
This	1
consideration	1
seems	1
sufficient	1
to	1
determine	1
our	1
opinion,	1
that	1
the	1
convention	1
have	1
gone	1
as	1
far	1
in	1
the	1
endeavor	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
numbers	1
in	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
treaties	1
as	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
reconciled	1
either	1
with	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
councils	1
or	1
with	1
a	1
reasonable	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
major	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
If	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
number	1
of	1
members	1
had	1
been	1
required,	1
it	1
would,	1
in	1
many	1
cases,	1
from	1
the	1
non-attendance	1
of	1
a	1
part,	1
amount	1
in	1
practice	1
to	1
a	1
necessity	1
of	1
unanimity.	1
And	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
every	1
political	1
establishment	1
in	1
which	1
this	1
principle	1
has	1
prevailed,	1
is	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
impotence,	1
perplexity,	1
and	1
disorder.	1
Proofs	1
of	1
this	1
position	1
might	1
be	1
adduced	1
from	1
the	1
examples	1
of	1
the	1
Roman	1
Tribuneship,	1
the	1
Polish	1
Diet,	1
and	1
the	1
States-General	1
of	1
the	1
Netherlands,	1
did	1
not	1
an	1
example	1
at	1
home	1
render	1
foreign	1
precedents	1
unnecessary.	1
To	1
require	1
a	1
fixed	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
would	1
not,	1
in	1
all	1
probability,	1
contribute	1
to	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
a	1
numerous	1
agency,	1
better	1
then	1
merely	1
to	1
require	1
a	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
attending	1
members.	1
The	1
former,	1
by	1
making	1
a	1
determinate	1
number	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
requisite	1
to	1
a	1
resolution,	1
diminishes	1
the	1
motives	1
to	1
punctual	1
attendance.	1
The	1
latter,	1
by	1
making	1
the	1
capacity	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
to	1
depend	1
on	1
a	1
PROPORTION	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
varied	1
by	1
the	1
absence	1
or	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
member,	1
has	1
the	1
contrary	1
effect.	1
And	1
as,	1
by	1
promoting	1
punctuality,	1
it	1
tends	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
body	1
complete,	1
there	1
is	1
great	1
likelihood	1
that	1
its	1
resolutions	1
would	1
generally	1
be	1
dictated	1
by	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
number	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
other;	1
while	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
much	1
fewer	1
occasions	1
of	1
delay.	1
It	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
forgotten	1
that,	1
under	1
the	1
existing	1
Confederation,	1
two	1
members	1
MAY,	1
and	1
usually	1
DO,	1
represent	1
a	1
State;	1
whence	1
it	1
happens	1
that	1
Congress,	1
who	1
now	1
are	1
solely	1
invested	1
with	1
ALL	1
THE	1
POWERS	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
rarely	1
consist	1
of	1
a	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
persons	1
than	1
would	1
compose	1
the	1
intended	1
Senate.	1
If	1
we	1
add	1
to	1
this,	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
members	1
vote	1
by	1
States,	1
and	1
that	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
single	1
member	1
present	1
from	1
a	1
State,	1
his	1
vote	1
is	1
lost,	1
it	1
will	1
justify	1
a	1
supposition	1
that	1
the	1
active	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
Senate,	1
where	1
the	1
members	1
are	1
to	1
vote	1
individually,	1
would	1
rarely	1
fall	1
short	1
in	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
active	1
voices	1
in	1
the	1
existing	1
Congress.	1
When,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
these	1
considerations,	1
we	1
take	1
into	1
view	1
the	1
co-operation	1
of	1
the	1
President,	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
hesitate	1
to	1
infer	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
America	1
would	1
have	1
greater	1
security	1
against	1
an	1
improper	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
treaties,	1
under	1
the	1
new	1
Constitution,	1
than	1
they	1
now	1
enjoy	1
under	1
the	1
Confederation.	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
proceed	1
still	1
one	1
step	1
further,	1
and	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
probable	1
augmentation	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
by	1
the	1
erection	1
of	1
new	1
States,	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
only	1
perceive	1
ample	1
ground	1
of	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
sufficiency	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
to	1
whose	1
agency	1
that	1
power	1
will	1
be	1
intrusted,	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
probably	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
conclude	1
that	1
a	1
body	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
the	1
Senate	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
become,	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
little	1
fit	1
for	1
the	1
proper	1
discharge	1
of	1
the	1
trust.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
President	1
is	1
"to	1
NOMINATE,	1
and,	1
by	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
advice	1
and	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
to	1
appoint	1
ambassadors,	1
other	1
public	1
ministers	1
and	1
consuls,	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court,	1
and	1
all	1
other	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
whose	1
appointments	1
are	1
not	1
otherwise	1
provided	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
But	1
the	1
Congress	1
may	1
by	1
law	1
vest	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
such	1
inferior	1
officers	1
as	1
they	1
think	1
proper,	1
in	1
the	1
President	1
alone,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
law,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
heads	1
of	1
departments.	1
The	1
President	1
shall	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
fill	1
up	1
ALL	1
VACANCIES	1
which	1
may	1
happen	1
DURING	1
THE	1
RECESS	1
OF	1
THE	1
SENATE,	1
by	1
granting	1
commissions	1
which	1
shall	1
EXPIRE	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
next	1
session."	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
observed	1
in	1
a	1
former	1
paper,	1
that	1
"the	1
true	1
test	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
government	1
is	1
its	1
aptitude	1
and	1
tendency	1
to	1
produce	1
a	1
good	1
administration."	1
If	1
the	1
justness	1
of	1
this	1
observation	1
be	1
admitted,	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
appointing	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
foregoing	1
clauses,	1
must,	1
when	1
examined,	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
entitled	1
to	1
particular	1
commendation.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
easy	1
to	1
conceive	1
a	1
plan	1
better	1
calculated	1
than	1
this	1
to	1
promote	1
a	1
judicious	1
choice	1
of	1
men	1
for	1
filling	1
the	1
offices	1
of	1
the	1
Union;	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
need	1
proof,	1
that	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
must	1
essentially	1
depend	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
its	1
administration.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
agreed	1
on	1
all	1
hands,	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
appointment,	1
in	1
ordinary	1
cases,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
modified	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
three	1
ways.	1
It	1
ought	1
either	1
to	1
be	1
vested	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
man,	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
SELECT	1
assembly	1
of	1
a	1
moderate	1
number;	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
man,	1
with	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
assembly.	1
The	1
exercise	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
at	1
large	1
will	1
be	1
readily	1
admitted	1
to	1
be	1
impracticable;	1
as	1
waiving	1
every	1
other	1
consideration,	1
it	1
would	1
leave	1
them	1
little	1
time	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
else.	1
When,	1
therefore,	1
mention	1
is	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
subsequent	1
reasonings	1
of	1
an	1
assembly	1
or	1
body	1
of	1
men,	1
what	1
is	1
said	1
must	1
be	1
understood	1
to	1
relate	1
to	1
a	1
select	1
body	1
or	1
assembly,	1
of	1
the	1
description	1
already	1
given.	1
The	1
people	1
collectively,	1
from	1
their	1
number	1
and	1
from	1
their	1
dispersed	1
situation,	1
cannot	1
be	1
regulated	1
in	1
their	1
movements	1
by	1
that	1
systematic	1
spirit	1
of	1
cabal	1
and	1
intrigue,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
urged	1
as	1
the	1
chief	1
objections	1
to	1
reposing	1
the	1
power	1
in	1
question	1
in	1
a	1
body	1
of	1
men.	1
Those	1
who	1
have	1
themselves	1
reflected	1
upon	1
the	1
subject,	1
or	1
who	1
have	1
attended	1
to	1
the	1
observations	1
made	1
in	1
other	1
parts	1
of	1
these	1
papers,	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
the	1
President,	1
will,	1
I	1
presume,	1
agree	1
to	1
the	1
position,	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
always	1
be	1
great	1
probability	1
of	1
having	1
the	1
place	1
supplied	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
abilities,	1
at	1
least	1
respectable.	1
Premising	1
this,	1
I	1
proceed	1
to	1
lay	1
it	1
down	1
as	1
a	1
rule,	1
that	1
one	1
man	1
of	1
discernment	1
is	1
better	1
fitted	1
to	1
analyze	1
and	1
estimate	1
the	1
peculiar	1
qualities	1
adapted	1
to	1
particular	1
offices,	1
than	1
a	1
body	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
equal	1
or	1
perhaps	1
even	1
of	1
superior	1
discernment.	1
The	1
sole	1
and	1
undivided	1
responsibility	1
of	1
one	1
man	1
will	1
naturally	1
beget	1
a	1
livelier	1
sense	1
of	1
duty	1
and	1
a	1
more	1
exact	1
regard	1
to	1
reputation.	1
He	1
will,	1
on	1
this	1
account,	1
feel	1
himself	1
under	1
stronger	1
obligations,	1
and	1
more	1
interested	1
to	1
investigate	1
with	1
care	1
the	1
qualities	1
requisite	1
to	1
the	1
stations	1
to	1
be	1
filled,	1
and	1
to	1
prefer	1
with	1
impartiality	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
fairest	1
pretensions	1
to	1
them.	1
He	1
will	1
have	1
FEWER	1
personal	1
attachments	1
to	1
gratify,	1
than	1
a	1
body	1
of	1
men	1
who	1
may	1
each	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
equal	1
number;	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
less	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
misled	1
by	1
the	1
sentiments	1
of	1
friendship	1
and	1
of	1
affection.	1
A	1
single	1
well-directed	1
man,	1
by	1
a	1
single	1
understanding,	1
cannot	1
be	1
distracted	1
and	1
warped	1
by	1
that	1
diversity	1
of	1
views,	1
feelings,	1
and	1
interests,	1
which	1
frequently	1
distract	1
and	1
warp	1
the	1
resolutions	1
of	1
a	1
collective	1
body.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
so	1
apt	1
to	1
agitate	1
the	1
passions	1
of	1
mankind	1
as	1
personal	1
considerations	1
whether	1
they	1
relate	1
to	1
ourselves	1
or	1
to	1
others,	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
our	1
choice	1
or	1
preference.	1
Hence,	1
in	1
every	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
appointing	1
to	1
offices,	1
by	1
an	1
assembly	1
of	1
men,	1
we	1
must	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
full	1
display	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
private	1
and	1
party	1
likings	1
and	1
dislikes,	1
partialities	1
and	1
antipathies,	1
attachments	1
and	1
animosities,	1
which	1
are	1
felt	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
compose	1
the	1
assembly.	1
The	1
choice	1
which	1
may	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances,	1
will	1
of	1
course	1
be	1
the	1
result	1
either	1
of	1
a	1
victory	1
gained	1
by	1
one	1
party	1
over	1
the	1
other,	1
or	1
of	1
a	1
compromise	1
between	1
the	1
parties.	1
In	1
either	1
case,	1
the	1
intrinsic	1
merit	1
of	1
the	1
candidate	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
often	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
In	1
the	1
first,	1
the	1
qualifications	1
best	1
adapted	1
to	1
uniting	1
the	1
suffrages	1
of	1
the	1
party,	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
considered	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
fit	1
the	1
person	1
for	1
the	1
station.	1
In	1
the	1
last,	1
the	1
coalition	1
will	1
commonly	1
turn	1
upon	1
some	1
interested	1
equivalent:	1
"Give	1
us	1
the	1
man	1
we	1
wish	1
for	1
this	1
office,	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
one	1
you	1
wish	1
for	1
that."	1
This	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
usual	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
bargain.	1
And	1
it	1
will	1
rarely	1
happen	1
that	1
the	1
advancement	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
service	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
primary	1
object	1
either	1
of	1
party	1
victories	1
or	1
of	1

negotiations.	1
The	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
principles	1
here	1
advanced	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
felt	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
intelligent	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
found	1
fault	1
with	1
the	1
provision	1
made,	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
by	1
the	1
convention.	1
They	1
contend	1
that	1
the	1
President	1
ought	1
solely	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
authorized	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
appointments	1
under	1
the	1
federal	1
government.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
show,	1
that	1
every	1
advantage	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
from	1
such	1
an	1
arrangement	1
would,	1
in	1
substance,	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
NOMINATION,	1
which	1
is	1
proposed	1
to	1
be	1
conferred	1
upon	1
him;	1
while	1
several	1
disadvantages	1
which	1
might	1
attend	1
the	1
absolute	1
power	1
of	1
appointment	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
that	1
officer	1
would	1
be	1
avoided.	1
In	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
nomination,	1
his	1
judgment	1
alone	1
would	1
be	1
exercised;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
his	1
sole	1
duty	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
the	1
man	1
who,	1
with	1
the	1
approbation	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
should	1
fill	1
an	1
office,	1
his	1
responsibility	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
complete	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
final	1
appointment.	1
There	1
can,	1
in	1
this	1
view,	1
be	1
no	1
difference	1
others,	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
our	1
choice	1
or	1
preference.	1
Hence,	1
in	1
every	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
appointing	1
to	1
offices,	1
by	1
an	1
assembly	1
of	1
men,	1
we	1
must	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
full	1
display	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
private	1
and	1
party	1
likings	1
and	1
dislikes,	1
partialities	1
and	1
antipathies,	1
attachments	1
and	1
animosities,	1
which	1
are	1
felt	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
compose	1
the	1
assembly.	1
The	1
choice	1
which	1
may	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances,	1
will	1
of	1
course	1
be	1
the	1
result	1
either	1
of	1
a	1
victory	1
gained	1
by	1
one	1
party	1
over	1
the	1
other,	1
or	1
of	1
a	1
compromise	1
between	1
the	1
parties.	1
In	1
either	1
case,	1
the	1
intrinsic	1
merit	1
of	1
the	1
candidate	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
often	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
In	1
the	1
first,	1
the	1
qualifications	1
best	1
adapted	1
to	1
uniting	1
the	1
suffrages	1
of	1
the	1
party,	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
considered	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
fit	1
the	1
person	1
for	1
the	1
station.	1
In	1
the	1
last,	1
the	1
coalition	1
will	1
commonly	1
turn	1
upon	1
some	1
interested	1
equivalent:	1
"Give	1
us	1
the	1
man	1
we	1
wish	1
for	1
this	1
office,	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
one	1
you	1
wish	1
for	1
that."	1
This	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
usual	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
bargain.	1
And	1
it	1
will	1
rarely	1
happen	1
that	1
the	1
advancement	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
service	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
primary	1
object	1
either	1
of	1
party	1
victories	1
or	1
of	1
party	1
negotiations.	1
The	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
principles	1
here	1
advanced	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
felt	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
intelligent	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
found	1

with	1
the	1

They	1
contend	1
that	1

to	1
have	1
been	1

to	1
make	1
the	1

under	1
the	1
federal	1

But	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
show,	1
that	1
every	1
advantage	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
from	1
such	1
an	1
arrangement	1
would,	1
in	1
substance,	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
NOMINATION,	1
which	1
is	1
proposed	1
to	1
be	1
conferred	1
upon	1
him;	1
while	1
several	1
disadvantages	1
which	1
might	1
attend	1
the	1
absolute	1
power	1
of	1
appointment	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
that	1
officer	1
would	1
be	1
avoided.	1
In	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
nomination,	1
his	1
judgment	1
alone	1
would	1
be	1
exercised;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
his	1
sole	1
duty	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
the	1
man	1
who,	1
with	1
the	1
approbation	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
should	1

office,	1
his	1
responsibility	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
complete	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
final	1
appointment.	1
There	1
can,	1
in	1
this	1
view,	1
be	1
no	1
difference	1
between	1
nominating	1
and	1
appointing.	1
The	1
same	1
motives	1
which	1
would	1
influence	1
a	1
proper	1
discharge	1
of	1
his	1
duty	1
in	1
one	1
case,	1
would	1
exist	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
And	1
as	1
no	1
man	1
could	1
be	1
appointed	1
but	1
on	1
his	1
previous	1
nomination,	1
every	1
man	1
who	1
might	1
be	1
appointed	1
would	1
be,	1
in	1
fact,	1
his	1
choice.	1
But	1
might	1
not	1
his	1
nomination	1
be	1
overruled?	1
I	1
grant	1
it	1
might,	1
yet	1
this	1
could	1
only	1
be	1
to	1
make	1
place	1
for	1
another	1
nomination	1
by	1
himself.	1
The	1
person	1
ultimately	1
appointed	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
preference,	1
though	1
perhaps	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
degree.	1
It	1
is	1
also	1
not	1
very	1
probable	1
that	1
his	1
nomination	1
would	1
often	1
be	1
overruled.	1
The	1
Senate	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
tempted,	1
by	1
the	1
preference	1
they	1
might	1
feel	1
to	1
another,	1
to	1
reject	1
the	1
one	1
proposed;	1
because	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
assure	1
themselves,	1
that	1
the	1
person	1
they	1
might	1
wish	1
would	1
be	1
brought	1
forward	1
by	1
a	1
second	1
or	1
by	1
any	1
subsequent	1
nomination.	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
be	1
certain,	1
that	1
a	1
future	1
nomination	1
would	1
present	1
a	1
candidate	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
more	1
acceptable	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
as	1
their	1
dissent	1
might	1
cast	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
stigma	1
upon	1
the	1
individual	1
rejected,	1
and	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
reflection	1
upon	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
magistrate,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
likely	1
that	1
their	1
sanction	1
would	1
often	1
be	1
refused,	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
special	1
and	1
strong	1
reasons	1
for	1
the	1
refusal.	1
To	1
what	1
purpose	1
then	1
require	1
the	1
co-operation	1
of	1
the	1
Senate?	1
I	1
answer,	1
that	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
their	1
concurrence	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
powerful,	1
though,	1
in	1
general,	1
a	1
silent	1
operation.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
excellent	1
check	1
upon	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
favoritism	1
in	1
the	1
President,	1
and	1
would	1
tend	1
greatly	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
unfit	1
characters	1
from	1
State	1
prejudice,	1
from	1
family	1
connection,	1
from	1
personal	1
attachment,	1
or	1
from	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
popularity.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
this,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
efficacious	1
source	1
of	1
stability	1
in	1
the	1
administration.	1
It	1
will	1
readily	1
be	1
comprehended,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
himself	1
the	1
sole	1
disposition	1
of	1
offices,	1
would	1
be	1
governed	1
much	1
more	1
by	1
his	1
private	1
inclinations	1
and	1
interests,	1
than	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
submit	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
his	1
choice	1
to	1
the	1
discussion	1
and	1
determination	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
and	1
independent	1
body,	1
and	1
that	1
body	1
an	1
entire	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
The	1
possibility	1
of	1
rejection	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
strong	1
motive	1
to	1
care	1
in	1
proposing.	1
The	1
danger	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
reputation,	1
and,	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
an	1
elective	1
magistrate,	1
to	1
his	1
political	1
existence,	1
from	1
betraying	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
favoritism,	1
or	1
an	1
unbecoming	1
pursuit	1
of	1
popularity,	1
to	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
a	1
body	1
whose	1
opinion	1
would	1
have	1
great	1
weight	1
in	1
forming	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
public,	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
operate	1
as	1
a	1
barrier	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
He	1
would	1
be	1
both	1
ashamed	1
and	1
afraid	1
to	1
bring	1
forward,	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
distinguished	1
or	1
lucrative	1
stations,	1
candidates	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
merit	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
State	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
particularly	1
belonged,	1
or	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
or	1
other	1
personally	1
allied	1
to	1
him,	1
or	1
of	1
possessing	1
the	1
necessary	1
insignificance	1
and	1
pliancy	1
to	1
render	1
them	1
the	1
obsequious	1
instruments	1
of	1
his	1
pleasure.	1
To	1
this	1
reasoning	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
objected	1
that	1
the	1
President,	1
by	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
nomination,	1
may	1
secure	1
the	1
complaisance	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
to	1
his	1
views.	1
This	1
supposition	1
of	1
universal	1
venalty	1
in	1
human	1
nature	1
is	1
little	1
less	1
an	1
error	1
in	1
political	1
reasoning,	1
than	1
the	1
supposition	1
of	1
universal	1
rectitude.	1
The	1
institution	1
of	1
delegated	1
power	1
implies,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
virtue	1
and	1
honor	1
among	1
mankind,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
reasonable	1
foundation	1
of	1
confidence;	1
and	1
experience	1
justifies	1
the	1
theory.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
to	1
exist	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
corrupt	1
periods	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
corrupt	1
governments.	1
The	1
venalty	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
House	1
of	1
Commons	1
has	1
been	1
long	1
a	1
topic	1
of	1
accusation	1
against	1
that	1
body,	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
belong	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
this;	1
and	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
doubted	1
that	1
the	1
charge	1
is,	1
to	1
a	1
considerable	1
extent,	1
well	1
founded.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
little	1
to	1
be	1
doubted,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
always	1
a	1
large	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
which	1
consists	1
of	1
independent	1
and	1
public-spirited	1
men,	1
who	1
have	1
an	1
influential	1
weight	1
in	1
the	1
councils	1
of	1
the	1
nation.	1
Hence	1
it	1
is	1
(the	1
present	1
reign	1
not	1
excepted)	1
that	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
that	1
body	1
is	1
often	1
seen	1
to	1
control	1
the	1
inclinations	1
of	1
the	1
monarch,	1
both	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
men	1
and	1
to	1
measures.	1
Though	1
it	1
might	1
therefore	1
be	1
allowable	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
Executive	1
might	1
occasionally	1
influence	1
some	1
individuals	1
in	1
the	1
Senate,	1
yet	1
the	1
supposition,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
in	1
general	1
purchase	1
the	1
integrity	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
body,	1
would	1
be	1
forced	1
and	1
improbable.	1
A	1
man	1
disposed	1
to	1
view	1
human	1
nature	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
without	1
either	1
flattering	1
its	1
virtues	1
or	1
exaggerating	1
its	1
vices,	1
will	1
see	1
sufficient	1
ground	1
of	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
probity	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
to	1
rest	1
satisfied,	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
impracticable	1
to	1
the	1
Executive	1
to	1
corrupt	1
or	1
seduce	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
its	1
members,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
its	1
co-operation,	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
appointments,	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
considerable	1
and	1
salutary	1
restraint	1
upon	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
that	1
magistrate.	1
Nor	1
is	1
the	1
integrity	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
the	1
only	1
reliance.	1
The	1
Constitution	1
has	1
provided	1
some	1
important	1
guards	1
against	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
executive	1
influence	1
upon	1
the	1
legislative	1
body:	1
it	1
declares	1
that	1
"No	1
senator	1
or	1
representative	1
shall	1
during	1
the	1
time	1
FOR	1
WHICH	1
HE	1
WAS	1
ELECTED,	1
be	1
appointed	1
to	1
any	1

the	1

which	1
shall	1
have	1
been	1
created,	1
or	1
the	1
emoluments	1
whereof	1
shall	1
have	1
been	1
increased,	1
during	1
such	1
time;	1
and	1
no	1
person,	1
holding	1
any	1
office	1
under	1
the	1

shall	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
IT	1
HAS	1
been	1
mentioned	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
advantages	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
from	1
the	1
co-operation	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
appointments,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
contribute	1
to	1
the	1
stability	1
of	1
the	1
administration.	1
The	1
consent	1
of	1
that	1
body	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
displace	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
appoint.	1
A	1
change	1
of	1
the	1
Chief	1
Magistrate,	1
therefore,	1
would	1
not	1
occasion	1
so	1
violent	1
or	1
so	1
general	1
a	1
revolution	1
in	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
expected,	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
the	1
sole	1
disposer	1
of	1
offices.	1
Where	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
any	1
station	1
had	1
given	1
satisfactory	1
evidence	1
of	1
his	1
fitness	1
for	1
it,	1
a	1
new	1
President	1
would	1
be	1
restrained	1
from	1
attempting	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
a	1
person	1
more	1
agreeable	1
to	1
him,	1
by	1
the	1
apprehension	1
that	1
a	1
discountenance	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
might	1
frustrate	1
the	1
attempt,	1
and	1
bring	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
discredit	1
upon	1
himself.	1
Those	1
who	1
can	1
best	1
estimate	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
a	1
steady	1
administration,	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
disposed	1
to	1
prize	1
a	1
provision	1
which	1
connects	1
the	1
official	1
existence	1
of	1
public	1
men	1
with	1
the	1
approbation	1
or	1
disapprobation	1
of	1
that	1
body	1
which,	1
from	1
the	1
greater	1
permanency	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
composition,	1
will	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
be	1
less	1
subject	1
to	1
inconstancy	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
To	1
this	1
union	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
with	1
the	1
President,	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
appointments,	1
it	1
has	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
been	1
suggested	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
serve	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
President	1
an	1
undue	1
influence	1
over	1
the	1
Senate,	1
and	1
in	1
others	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
an	1
opposite	1
tendency,	1
a	1
strong	1
proof	1
that	1
neither	1
suggestion	1
is	1
true.	1
To	1
state	1
the	1
first	1
in	1
its	1
proper	1
form,	1
is	1
to	1
refute	1
it.	1
It	1
amounts	1
to	1
this:	1
the	1
President	1
would	1
have	1
an	1
improper	1
INFLUENCE	1
OVER	1
the	1
Senate,	1
because	1
the	1
Senate	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
RESTRAINING	1
him.	1
This	1
is	1
an	1
absurdity	1
in	1
terms.	1
It	1
cannot	1
admit	1
of	1
a	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
entire	1
power	1
of	1
appointment	1
would	1
enable	1
him	1
much	1
more	1
effectually	1
to	1
establish	1
a	1
dangerous	1
empire	1
over	1
that	1
body,	1
than	1
a	1
mere	1
power	1
of	1
nomination	1
subject	1
to	1
their	1
control.	1
Let	1
us	1
take	1
a	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
converse	1
of	1
the	1
proposition:	1
"the	1
Senate	1
would	1
influence	1
the	1
Executive."	1
As	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
occasion	1
to	1
remark	1
in	1
several	1
other	1
instances,	1
the	1
indistinctness	1
of	1
the	1
objection	1
forbids	1
a	1
precise	1
answer.	1
In	1
what	1
manner	1
is	1
this	1
influence	1
to	1
be	1
exerted?	1
In	1
relation	1
to	1
what	1
objects?	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
influencing	1
a	1
person,	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
here	1
used,	1
must	1
imply	1
a	1
power	1
of	1
conferring	1
a	1
benefit	1
upon	1
him.	1
How	1
could	1
the	1
Senate	1
confer	1
a	1
benefit	1
upon	1
the	1
President	1
by	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
employing	1
their	1
right	1
of	1
negative	1
upon	1
his	1
nominations?	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
said	1
they	1
might	1
sometimes	1
gratify	1
him	1
by	1
an	1
acquiescence	1
in	1
a	1
favorite	1
choice,	1
when	1
public	1
motives	1
might	1
dictate	1
a	1
different	1
conduct,	1
I	1
answer,	1
that	1
the	1
instances	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
President	1
could	1
be	1
personally	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
result,	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
few	1
to	1
admit	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
materially	1
affected	1
by	1
the	1
compliances	1
of	1
the	1
Senate.	1
The	1
POWER	1
which	1
can	1
ORIGINATE	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
honors	1
and	1
emoluments,	1
is	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
attract	1
than	1
to	1
be	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
POWER	1
which	1
can	1
merely	1
obstruct	1
their	1
course.	1
If	1
by	1
influencing	1
the	1
President	1
be	1
meant	1
RESTRAINING	1
him,	1
this	1
is	1
precisely	1
what	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
intended.	1
And	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
shown	1
that	1
the	1
restraint	1
would	1
be	1
salutary,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
destroy	1
a	1
single	1
advantage	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
uncontrolled	1
agency	1
of	1
that	1
Magistrate.	1
The	1
right	1
of	1
nomination	1
would	1
produce	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
that	1
of	1
appointment,	1
and	1
would	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure	1
avoid	1
its	1
evils.	1
Upon	1
a	1
comparison	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
for	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
government	1
with	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
established	1
by	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
this	1
State,	1
a	1
decided	1
preference	1
must	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
former.	1
In	1
that	1
plan	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
nomination	1
is	1
unequivocally	1
vested	1
in	1
the	1
Executive.	1
And	1
as	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
necessity	1
for	1
submitting	1
each	1
nomination	1
to	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
an	1
entire	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
the	1
circumstances	1
attending	1
an	1
appointment,	1
from	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
conducting	1
it,	1
would	1
naturally	1
become	1
matters	1
of	1
notoriety;	1
and	1
the	1
public	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
no	1
loss	1
to	1
determine	1
what	1
part	1
had	1
been	1
performed	1
by	1
the	1
different	1
actors.	1
The	1
blame	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
nomination	1
would	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
President	1
singly	1
and	1
absolutely.	1
The	1
censure	1
of	1
rejecting	1
a	1
good	1
one	1
would	1
lie	1
entirely	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
Senate;	1
aggravated	1
by	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
their	1
having	1
counteracted	1
the	1
good	1
intentions	1
of	1
the	1
Executive.	1
If	1
an	1
ill	1
appointment	1
should	1
be	1
made,	1
the	1
Executive	1
for	1
nominating,	1
and	1
the	1
Senate	1
for	1
approving,	1
would	1
participate,	1
though	1
in	1
different	1
degrees,	1
in	1
the	1
opprobrium	1
and	1
disgrace.	1
The	1
reverse	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
characterizes	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
appointment	1
in	1
this	1
State.	1
The	1
council	1
of	1
appointment	1
consists	1
of	1
from	1
three	1
to	1
five	1
persons,	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
governor	1
is	1
always	1
one.	1
This	1
small	1
body,	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
private	1
apartment,	1
impenetrable	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
eye,	1
proceed	1
to	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
trust	1
committed	1
to	1
them.	1
It	1
is	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
governor	1
claims	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
nomination,	1
upon	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
some	1
ambiguous	1
expressions	1
in	1
the	1
constitution;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
known	1
to	1
what	1
extent,	1
or	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
he	1
exercises	1
it;	1
nor	1
upon	1
what	1
occasions	1
he	1
is	1
contradicted	1
or	1
opposed.	1
The	1
censure	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
appointment,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
uncertainty	1
of	1
its	1
author,	1
and	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
determinate	1
object,	1
has	1
neither	1
poignancy	1
nor	1
duration.	1
And	1
while	1
an	1
unbounded	1
field	1
for	1
cabal	1
and	1
intrigue	1
lies	1
open,	1
all	1
idea	1
of	1
responsibility	1
is	1
lost.	1
The	1
most	1
that	1
the	1
public	1
can	1
know,	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
governor	1
claims	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
nomination;	1
that	1
TWO	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
inconsiderable	1
number	1
of	1
FOUR	1
men	1
can	1
too	1
often	1
be	1
managed	1
without	1
much	1
difficulty;	1
that	1
if	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
a	1
particular	1
council	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
an	1
uncomplying	1
character,	1
it	1
is	1
frequently	1
not	1
impossible	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
their	1
opposition	1
by	1
regulating	1
the	1
times	1
of	1
meeting	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
their	1
attendance	1
inconvenient;	1
and	1
that	1
from	1
whatever	1
cause	1
it	1
may	1
proceed,	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
very	1
improper	1
appointments	1
are	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
made.	1
Whether	1
a	1
governor	1
of	1
this	1
State	1
avails	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
ascendant	1
he	1
must	1
necessarily	1
have,	1
in	1
this	1
delicate	1
and	1
important	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
administration,	1
to	1
prefer	1
to	1
offices	1
men	1
who	1
are	1
best	1
qualified	1
for	1
them,	1
or	1
whether	1
he	1
prostitutes	1
that	1
advantage	1
to	1
the	1
advancement	1
of	1
persons	1
whose	1
chief	1
merit	1
is	1
their	1
implicit	1
devotion	1
to	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
a	1
despicable	1
and	1
dangerous	1
system	1
of	1
personal	1
influence,	1
are	1
questions	1
which,	1
unfortunately	1
for	1
the	1
community,	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
the	1
subjects	1
of	1
speculation	1
and	1
conjecture.	1
Every	1
mere	1
council	1
of	1
appointment,	1
however	1
constituted,	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
conclave,	1
in	1
which	1
cabal	1
and	1
intrigue	1
will	1
have	1
their	1
full	1
scope.	1
Their	1
number,	1
without	1
an	1
unwarrantable	1
increase	1
of	1
expense,	1
cannot	1
be	1
large	1
enough	1
to	1
preclude	1
a	1
facility	1
of	1
combination.	1
And	1
as	1
each	1
member	1
will	1
have	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
connections	1
to	1
provide	1
for,	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
mutual	1
gratification	1
will	1
beget	1
a	1
scandalous	1
bartering	1
of	1
votes	1
and	1
bargaining	1
for	1
places.	1
The	1
private	1
attachments	1
of	1
one	1
man	1
might	1
easily	1
be	1
satisfied;	1
but	1
to	1
satisfy	1
the	1
private	1
attachments	1
of	1
a	1
dozen,	1
or	1
of	1
twenty	1
men,	1
would	1
occasion	1
a	1
monopoly	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
principal	1
employments	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
families,	1
and	1
would	1
lead	1
more	1
directly	1
to	1
an	1
aristocracy	1
or	1
an	1
oligarchy	1
than	1
any	1
measure	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
contrived.	1
If,	1
to	1
avoid	1
an	1
accumulation	1
of	1
offices,	1
there	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
frequent	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
compose	1
the	1
council,	1
this	1
would	1
involve	1
the	1
mischiefs	1
of	1
a	1
mutable	1
administration	1
in	1
their	1
full	1
extent.	1
Such	1
a	1
council	1
would	1
also	1
be	1
more	1
liable	1
to	1
executive	1
influence	1
than	1
the	1
Senate,	1
because	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
fewer	1
in	1
number,	1
and	1
would	1
act	1
less	1
immediately	1
under	1
the	1
public	1
inspection.	1
Such	1
a	1
council,	1
in	1
fine,	1
as	1
a	1
substitute	1
for	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
would	1
be	1
productive	1
of	1
an	1
increase	1
of	1
expense,	1
a	1
multiplication	1
of	1
the	1
evils	1
which	1
spring	1
from	1
favoritism	1
and	1
intrigue	1
in	1
the	1
distribution	1
of	1
public	1
honors,	1
a	1
decrease	1
of	1
stability	1
in	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
a	1
diminution	1
of	1
the	1
security	1
against	1
an	1
undue	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
Executive.	1
And	1
yet	1
such	1
a	1
council	1
has	1
been	1
warmly	1
contended	1
for	1
as	1
an	1
essential	1
amendment	1
in	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
with	1
propriety	1
conclude	1
my	1
observations	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
appointments	1
without	1
taking	1
notice	1
of	1
a	1
scheme	1
for	1
which	1
there	1
have	1
appeared	1
some,	1
though	1
but	1
few	1
advocates;	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
of	1
uniting	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
them.	1
I	1
shall,	1
however,	1
do	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
mention	1
it,	1
as	1
I	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
gain	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
any	1
considerable	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
A	1
body	1
so	1
fluctuating	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
so	1
numerous,	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
deemed	1
proper	1
for	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
that	1
power.	1
Its	1
unfitness	1
will	1
appear	1
manifest	1
to	1
all,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
recollected	1
that	1
in	1
half	1
a	1
century	1
it	1
may	1
consist	1
of	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
hundred	1
persons.	1
All	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
stability,	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Senate,	1
would	1
be	1
defeated	1
by	1
this	1
union,	1
and	1
infinite	1
delays	1
and	1
embarrassments	1
would	1
be	1
occasioned.	1
The	1
example	1
of	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
in	1
their	1
local	1
constitutions	1
encourages	1
us	1
to	1
reprobate	1
the	1
idea.	1
The	1
only	1
remaining	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
Executive	1
are	1
comprehended	1
in	1
giving	1
information	1
to	1
Congress	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
Union;	1
in	1
recommending	1
to	1
their	1
consideration	1
such	1
measures	1
as	1
he	1
shall	1
judge	1
expedient;	1
in	1
convening	1
them,	1
or	1
either	1
branch,	1
upon	1
extraordinary	1
occasions;	1
in	1
adjourning	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
cannot	1
themselves	1
agree	1
upon	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
adjournment;	1
in	1
receiving	1
ambassadors	1
and	1
other	1
public	1
ministers;	1
in	1
faithfully	1
executing	1
the	1
laws;	1
and	1
in	1
commissioning	1
all	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
Except	1
some	1
cavils	1
about	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
convening	1
EITHER	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
receiving	1
ambassadors,	1
no	1
objection	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
this	1
class	1
of	1
authorities;	1
nor	1
could	1
they	1
possibly	1
admit	1
of	1
any.	1
It	1
required,	1
indeed,	1
an	1
insatiable	1
avidity	1
for	1
censure	1
to	1
invent	1
exceptions	1
to	1
the	1
parts	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
excepted	1
to.	1
In	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
convening	1
either	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
I	1
shall	1
barely	1
remark,	1
that	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
Senate	1
at	1
least,	1
we	1
can	1
readily	1
discover	1
a	1
good	1
reason	1
for	1
it.	1
AS	1
this	1
body	1
has	1
a	1
concurrent	1
power	1
with	1
the	1
Executive	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
treaties,	1
it	1
might	1
often	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
call	1
it	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
this	1
object,	1
when	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
unnecessary	1
and	1
improper	1
to	1
convene	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
ambassadors,	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
former	1
paper	1
will	1
furnish	1
a	1
sufficient	1
answer.	1
We	1
have	1
now	1
completed	1
a	1
survey	1
of	1
the	1
structure	1
and	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
department,	1
which,	1
I	1
have	1
endeavored	1
to	1
show,	1
combines,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
republican	1
principles	1
will	1
admit,	1
all	1
the	1
requisites	1
to	1
energy.	1
The	1
remaining	1
inquiry	1
is:	1
Does	1
it	1
also	1
combine	1
the	1
requisites	1
to	1
safety,	1
in	1
a	1
republican	1
sense,	1
a	1
due	1
dependence	1
on	1
the	1
people,	1
a	1
due	1
responsibility?	1
The	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
question	1
has	1
been	1
anticipated	1
in	1
the	1
investigation	1
of	1
its	1
other	1
characteristics,	1
and	1
is	1
satisfactorily	1
deducible	1
from	1
these	1
circumstances;	1
from	1
the	1
election	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
once	1
in	1
four	1
years	1
by	1
persons	1
immediately	1
chosen	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
for	1
that	1
purpose;	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
being	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
liable	1
to	1
impeachment,	1
trial,	1
dismission	1
from	1
office,	1
incapacity	1
to	1
serve	1
in	1
any	1
other,	1
and	1
to	1
forfeiture	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
estate	1
by	1
subsequent	1
prosecution	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
course	1
of	1
law.	1
But	1
these	1
precautions,	1
great	1
as	1
they	1
are,	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
ones	1
which	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
has	1
provided	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
security.	1
In	1
the	1
only	1
instances	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
abuse	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
authority	1
was	1
materially	1
to	1
be	1
feared,	1
the	1
Chief	1
Magistrate	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
would,	1
by	1
that	1
plan,	1
be	1
subjected	1
to	1
the	1
control	1
of	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
What	1
more	1
could	1
be	1
desired	1
by	1
an	1
enlightened	1
and	1
reasonable	1
people?	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
WE	1
PROCEED	1
now	1
to	1
an	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
government.	1
In	1
unfolding	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
existing	1
Confederation,	1
the	1
utility	1
and	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
federal	1
judicature	1
have	1
been	1
clearly	1
pointed	1
out.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
less	1
necessary	1
to	1
recapitulate	1
the	1
considerations	1
there	1
urged,	1
as	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
the	1
institution	1
in	1
the	1
abstract	1
is	1
not	1
disputed;	1
the	1
only	1
questions	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
raised	1
being	1
relative	1
to	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
constituting	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
its	1
extent.	1
To	1
these	1
points,	1
therefore,	1
our	1
observations	1
shall	1
be	1
confined.	1
The	1
manner	1
of	1
constituting	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
embrace	1
these	1
several	1
objects:	1
1st.	1
The	1
mode	1
of	1
appointing	1
the	1
judges.	1
2d.	1
The	1
tenure	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
places.	1
3d.	1
The	1
partition	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
authority	1
between	1
different	1
courts,	1
and	1
their	1
relations	1
to	1
each	1
other.	1
First.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
appointing	1
the	1
judges;	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
appointing	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
in	1
general,	1
and	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
fully	1
discussed	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
last	1
numbers,	1
that	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
said	1
here	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
useless	1
repetition.	1
Second.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
tenure	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
judges	1
are	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
places;	1
this	1
chiefly	1
concerns	1
their	1
duration	1
in	1
office;	1
the	1
provisions	1
for	1
their	1
support;	1
the	1
precautions	1
for	1
their	1
responsibility.	1
According	1
to	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
all	1
judges	1
who	1
may	1
be	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
are	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
offices	1
DURING	1
GOOD	1
BEHAVIOR;	1
which	1
is	1
conformable	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
approved	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
rest,	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
this	1
State.	1
Its	1
propriety	1
having	1
been	1
drawn	1
into	1
question	1
by	1
the	1
adversaries	1
of	1
that	1
plan,	1
is	1
no	1
light	1
symptom	1
of	1
the	1
rage	1
for	1
objection,	1
which	1
disorders	1
their	1
imaginations	1
and	1
judgments.	1
The	1
standard	1
of	1
good	1
behavior	1
for	1
the	1
continuance	1
in	1
office	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
magistracy,	1
is	1
certainly	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
valuable	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
improvements	1
in	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
government.	1
In	1
a	1
monarchy	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
barrier	1
to	1
the	1
despotism	1
of	1
the	1
prince;	1
in	1
a	1
republic	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
no	1
less	1
excellent	1
barrier	1
to	1
the	1
encroachments	1
and	1
oppressions	1
of	1
the	1
representative	1
body.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
expedient	1
which	1
can	1
be	1
devised	1
in	1
any	1
government,	1
to	1
secure	1
a	1
steady,	1
upright,	1
and	1
impartial	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
laws.	1
Whoever	1
attentively	1
considers	1
the	1
different	1
departments	1
of	1
power	1
must	1
perceive,	1
that,	1
in	1
a	1
government	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
separated	1
from	1
each	1
other,	1
the	1
judiciary,	1
from	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
its	1
functions,	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
the	1
least	1
dangerous	1
to	1
the	1
political	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution;	1
because	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
least	1
in	1
a	1
capacity	1
to	1
annoy	1
or	1
injure	1
them.	1
The	1
Executive	1
not	1
only	1
dispenses	1
the	1
honors,	1
but	1
holds	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
The	1
legislature	1
not	1
only	1
commands	1
the	1
purse,	1
but	1
prescribes	1
the	1
rules	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
duties	1
and	1
rights	1
of	1
every	1
citizen	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
regulated.	1
The	1
judiciary,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
has	1
no	1
influence	1
over	1
either	1
the	1
sword	1
or	1
the	1
purse;	1
no	1
direction	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
strength	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
the	1
society;	1
and	1
can	1
take	1
no	1
active	1
resolution	1
whatever.	1
It	1
may	1
truly	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
neither	1
FORCE	1
nor	1
WILL,	1
but	1
merely	1
judgment;	1
and	1
must	1
ultimately	1
depend	1
upon	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
the	1
executive	1
arm	1
even	1
for	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
its	1
judgments.	1
This	1
simple	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
suggests	1
several	1
important	1
consequences.	1
It	1
proves	1
incontestably,	1
that	1
the	1
judiciary	1
is	1
beyond	1
comparison	1
the	1
weakest	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
departments	1
of	1
power1;	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
never	1
attack	1
with	1
success	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
two;	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
possible	1
care	1
is	1
requisite	1
to	1
enable	1
it	1
to	1
defend	1
itself	1
against	1
their	1
attacks.	1
It	1
equally	1
proves,	1
that	1
though	1
individual	1
oppression	1
may	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
proceed	1
from	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
justice,	1
the	1
general	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
endangered	1
from	1
that	1
quarter;	1
I	1
mean	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
judiciary	1
remains	1
truly	1
distinct	1
from	1
both	1
the	1
legislature	1
and	1
the	1
Executive.	1
For	1
I	1
agree,	1
that	1
"there	1
is	1
no	1
liberty,	1
if	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
judging	1
be	1
not	1
separated	1
from	1
the	1
legislative	1
and	1
executive	1
powers."2	1
And	1
it	1
proves,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
place,	1
that	1
as	1
liberty	1
can	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
fear	1
from	1
the	1
judiciary	1
alone,	1
but	1
would	1
have	1
every	1
thing	1
to	1
fear	1
from	1
its	1
union	1
with	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
departments;	1
that	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
union	1
must	1
ensue	1
from	1
a	1
dependence	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
on	1
the	1
latter,	1
notwithstanding	1
a	1
nominal	1
and	1
apparent	1
separation;	1
that	1
as,	1
from	1
the	1
natural	1
feebleness	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary,	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
continual	1
jeopardy	1
of	1
being	1
overpowered,	1
awed,	1
or	1
influenced	1
by	1
its	1
co-ordinate	1
branches;	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
nothing	1
can	1
contribute	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
its	1
firmness	1
and	1
independence	1
as	1
permanency	1
in	1
office,	1
this	1
quality	1
may	1
therefore	1
be	1
justly	1
regarded	1
as	1
an	1
indispensable	1
ingredient	1
in	1
its	1
constitution,	1
and,	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure,	1
as	1
the	1
citadel	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
justice	1
and	1
the	1
public	1
security.	1
The	1
complete	1
independence	1
of	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
justice	1
is	1
peculiarly	1
essential	1
in	1
a	1
limited	1
Constitution.	1
By	1
a	1
limited	1
Constitution,	1
I	1
understand	1
one	1
which	1
contains	1
certain	1
specified	1
exceptions	1
to	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority;	1
such,	1
for	1
instance,	1
as	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1
pass	1
no	1
bills	1
of	1
attainder,	1
no	1
ex-post-facto	1
laws,	1
and	1
the	1
like.	1
Limitations	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
can	1
be	1
preserved	1
in	1
practice	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
than	1
through	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
courts	1
of	1
justice,	1
whose	1
duty	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
declare	1
all	1
acts	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
manifest	1
tenor	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
void.	1
Without	1
this,	1
all	1
the	1
reservations	1
of	1
particular	1
rights	1
or	1
privileges	1
would	1
amount	1
to	1
nothing.	1
Some	1
perplexity	1
respecting	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
courts	1
to	1
pronounce	1
legislative	1
acts	1
void,	1
because	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
has	1
arisen	1
from	1
an	1
imagination	1
that	1
the	1
doctrine	1
would	1
imply	1
a	1
superiority	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
to	1
the	1
legislative	1
power.	1
It	1
is	1
urged	1
that	1
the	1
authority	1
which	1
can	1
declare	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
another	1
void,	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
whose	1
acts	1
may	1
be	1
declared	1
void.	1
As	1
this	1
doctrine	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
American	1
constitutions,	1
a	1
brief	1
discussion	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
rests	1
cannot	1
be	1
unacceptable.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
position	1
which	1
depends	1
on	1
clearer	1
principles,	1
than	1
that	1
every	1
act	1
of	1
a	1
delegated	1
authority,	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
tenor	1
of	1
the	1
commission	1
under	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
exercised,	1
is	1
void.	1
No	1
legislative	1
act,	1
therefore,	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
can	1
be	1
valid.	1
To	1
deny	1
this,	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
affirm,	1
that	1
the	1
deputy	1
is	1
greater	1
than	1
his	1
principal;	1
that	1
the	1
servant	1
is	1
above	1
his	1
master;	1
that	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
themselves;	1
that	1
men	1
acting	1
by	1
virtue	1
of	1
powers,	1
may	1
do	1
not	1
only	1
what	1
their	1
powers	1
do	1
not	1
authorize,	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
forbid.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
legislative	1
body	1
are	1
themselves	1
the	1
constitutional	1
judges	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
powers,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
construction	1
they	1
put	1
upon	1
them	1
is	1
conclusive	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
departments,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
answered,	1
that	1
this	1
cannot	1
be	1
the	1
natural	1
presumption,	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
collected	1
from	1
any	1
particular	1
provisions	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
otherwise	1
to	1
be	1
supposed,	1
that	1
the	1
Constitution	1
could	1
intend	1
to	1
enable	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
substitute	1
their	1
WILL	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
their	1
constituents.	1
It	1
is	1
far	1
more	1
rational	1
to	1
suppose,	1
that	1
the	1
courts	1
were	1
designed	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
intermediate	1
body	1
between	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
the	1
legislature,	1
in	1
order,	1
among	1
other	1
things,	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
latter	1
within	1
the	1
limits	1
assigned	1
to	1
their	1
authority.	1
The	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
is	1
the	1
proper	1
and	1
peculiar	1
province	1
of	1
the	1
courts.	1
A	1
constitution	1
is,	1
in	1
fact,	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
regarded	1
by	1
the	1
judges,	1
as	1
a	1
fundamental	1
law.	1
It	1
therefore	1
belongs	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
ascertain	1
its	1
meaning,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
any	1
particular	1
act	1
proceeding	1
from	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
If	1
there	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
irreconcilable	1
variance	1
between	1
the	1
two,	1
that	1
which	1
has	1
the	1
superior	1
obligation	1
and	1
validity	1
ought,	1
of	1
course,	1
to	1
be	1
preferred;	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
the	1
Constitution	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
preferred	1
to	1
the	1
statute,	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
their	1
agents.	1
Nor	1
does	1
this	1
conclusion	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
suppose	1
a	1
superiority	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
to	1
the	1
legislative	1
power.	1
It	1
only	1
supposes	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
is	1
superior	1
to	1
both;	1
and	1
that	1
where	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
declared	1
in	1
its	1
statutes,	1
stands	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
declared	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
the	1
judges	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
governed	1
by	1
the	1
latter	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
former.	1
They	1
ought	1
to	1
regulate	1
their	1
decisions	1
by	1
the	1
fundamental	1
laws,	1
rather	1
than	1
by	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
fundamental.	1
This	1
exercise	1
of	1
judicial	1
discretion,	1
in	1
determining	1
between	1
two	1
contradictory	1
laws,	1
is	1
exemplified	1
in	1
a	1
familiar	1
instance.	1
It	1
not	1
uncommonly	1
happens,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
statutes	1
existing	1
at	1
one	1
time,	1
clashing	1
in	1
whole	1
or	1
in	1
part	1
with	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
containing	1
any	1
repealing	1
clause	1
or	1
expression.	1
In	1
such	1
a	1
case,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
the	1
courts	1
to	1
liquidate	1
and	1
fix	1
their	1
meaning	1
and	1
operation.	1
So	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
can,	1
by	1
any	1
fair	1
construction,	1
be	1
reconciled	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
reason	1
and	1
law	1
conspire	1
to	1
dictate	1
that	1
this	1
should	1
be	1
done;	1
where	1
this	1
is	1
impracticable,	1
it	1
becomes	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
necessity	1
to	1
give	1
effect	1
to	1
one,	1
in	1
exclusion	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
The	1
rule	1
which	1
has	1
obtained	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
for	1
determining	1
their	1
relative	1
validity	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
last	1
in	1
order	1
of	1
time	1
shall	1
be	1
preferred	1
to	1
the	1
first.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
mere	1
rule	1
of	1
construction,	1
not	1
derived	1
from	1
any	1
positive	1
law,	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
nature	1
and	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
thing.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
rule	1
not	1
enjoined	1
upon	1
the	1
courts	1
by	1
legislative	1
provision,	1
but	1
adopted	1
by	1
themselves,	1
as	1
consonant	1
to	1
truth	1
and	1
propriety,	1
for	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
their	1
conduct	1
as	1
interpreters	1
of	1
the	1
law.	1
They	1
thought	1
it	1
reasonable,	1
that	1
between	1
the	1
interfering	1
acts	1
of	1
an	1
EQUAL	1
authority,	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
indication	1
of	1
its	1
will	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
preference.	1
But	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
interfering	1
acts	1
of	1
a	1
superior	1
and	1
subordinate	1
authority,	1
of	1
an	1
original	1
and	1
derivative	1
power,	1
the	1
nature	1
and	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
indicate	1
the	1
converse	1
of	1
that	1
rule	1
as	1
proper	1
to	1
be	1
followed.	1
They	1
teach	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
prior	1
act	1
of	1
a	1
superior	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
preferred	1
to	1
the	1
subsequent	1
act	1
of	1
an	1
inferior	1
and	1
subordinate	1
authority;	1
and	1
that	1
accordingly,	1
whenever	1
a	1
particular	1
statute	1
contravenes	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
tribunals	1
to	1
adhere	1
to	1
the	1
latter	1
and	1
disregard	1
the	1
former.	1
It	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
weight	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
courts,	1
on	1
the	1
pretense	1
of	1
a	1
repugnancy,	1
may	1
substitute	1
their	1
own	1
pleasure	1
to	1
the	1
constitutional	1
intentions	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
This	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
happen	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
two	1
contradictory	1
statutes;	1
or	1
it	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
happen	1
in	1
every	1
adjudication	1
upon	1
any	1
single	1
statute.	1
The	1
courts	1
must	1
declare	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
law;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
exercise	1
WILL	1
instead	1
of	1
JUDGMENT,	1
the	1
consequence	1
would	1
equally	1
be	1
the	1
substitution	1
of	1
their	1
pleasure	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
The	1
observation,	1
if	1
it	1
prove	1
any	1
thing,	1
would	1
prove	1
that	1
there	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
judges	1
distinct	1
from	1
that	1
body.	1
If,	1
then,	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
justice	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
the	1
bulwarks	1
of	1
a	1
limited	1
Constitution	1
against	1
legislative	1
encroachments,	1
this	1
consideration	1
will	1
afford	1
a	1
strong	1
argument	1
for	1
the	1
permanent	1
tenure	1
of	1
judicial	1
offices,	1
since	1
nothing	1
will	1
contribute	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
this	1
to	1
that	1
independent	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
judges	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
faithful	1
performance	1
of	1
so	1
arduous	1
a	1
duty.	1
This	1
independence	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
is	1
equally	1
requisite	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
Constitution	1
and	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
individuals	1
from	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
those	1
ill	1
humors,	1
which	1
the	1
arts	1
of	1
designing	1
men,	1
or	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
particular	1
conjunctures,	1
sometimes	1
disseminate	1
among	1
the	1
people	1
themselves,	1
and	1
which,	1
though	1
they	1
speedily	1
give	1
place	1
to	1
better	1
information,	1
and	1
more	1
deliberate	1
reflection,	1
have	1
a	1
tendency,	1
in	1
the	1
meantime,	1
to	1
occasion	1
dangerous	1
innovations	1
in	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
serious	1
oppressions	1
of	1
the	1
minor	1
party	1
in	1
the	1
community.	1
Though	1
I	1
trust	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
will	1
never	1
concur	1
with	1
its	1
enemies,3	1
in	1
questioning	1
that	1
fundamental	1
principle	1
of	1
republican	1
government,	1
which	1
admits	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
to	1
alter	1
or	1
abolish	1
the	1
established	1
Constitution,	1
whenever	1
they	1
find	1
it	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
their	1
happiness,	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
inferred	1
from	1
this	1
principle,	1
that	1
the	1
representatives	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
whenever	1
a	1
momentary	1
inclination	1
happens	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
of	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
their	1
constituents,	1
incompatible	1
with	1
the	1
provisions	1
in	1
the	1
existing	1
Constitution,	1
would,	1
on	1
that	1
account,	1
be	1
justifiable	1
in	1
a	1
violation	1
of	1
those	1
provisions;	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
courts	1
would	1
be	1
under	1
a	1
greater	1
obligation	1
to	1
connive	1
at	1
infractions	1
in	1
this	1
shape,	1
than	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
proceeded	1
wholly	1
from	1
the	1
cabals	1
of	1
the	1
representative	1
body.	1
Until	1
the	1
people	1
have,	1
by	1
some	1
solemn	1
and	1
authoritative	1
act,	1
annulled	1
or	1
changed	1
the	1
established	1
form,	1
it	1
is	1
binding	1
upon	1
themselves	1
collectively,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
individually;	1
and	1
no	1
presumption,	1
or	1
even	1
knowledge,	1
of	1
their	1
sentiments,	1
can	1
warrant	1
their	1
representatives	1
in	1
a	1
departure	1
from	1
it,	1
prior	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
act.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
require	1
an	1
uncommon	1
portion	1
of	1
fortitude	1
in	1
the	1
judges	1
to	1
do	1
their	1
duty	1
as	1
faithful	1
guardians	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
where	1
legislative	1
invasions	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
instigated	1
by	1
the	1
major	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
infractions	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
only,	1
that	1
the	1
independence	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
may	1
be	1
an	1
essential	1
safeguard	1
against	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
occasional	1
ill	1
humors	1
in	1
the	1
society.	1
These	1
sometimes	1
extend	1
no	1
farther	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
injury	1
of	1
the	1
private	1
rights	1
of	1
particular	1
classes	1
of	1
citizens,	1
by	1
unjust	1
and	1
partial	1
laws.	1
Here	1
also	1
the	1
firmness	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
magistracy	1
is	1
of	1
vast	1
importance	1
in	1
mitigating	1
the	1
severity	1
and	1
confining	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
such	1
laws.	1
It	1
not	1
only	1
serves	1
to	1
moderate	1
the	1
immediate	1
mischiefs	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
passed,	1
but	1
it	1
operates	1
as	1
a	1
check	1
upon	1
the	1
legislative	1
body	1
in	1
passing	1
them;	1
who,	1
perceiving	1
that	1
obstacles	1
to	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
iniquitous	1
intention	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
expected	1
from	1
the	1
scruples	1
of	1
the	1
courts,	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
compelled,	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
motives	1
of	1
the	1
injustice	1
they	1
meditate,	1
to	1
qualify	1
their	1
attempts.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
circumstance	1
calculated	1
to	1
have	1
more	1
influence	1
upon	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
our	1
governments,	1
than	1
but	1
few	1
may	1
be	1
aware	1
of.	1
The	1
benefits	1
of	1
the	1
integrity	1
and	1
moderation	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
have	1
already	1
been	1
felt	1
in	1
more	1
States	1
than	1
one;	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
displeased	1
those	1
whose	1
sinister	1
expectations	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
disappointed,	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
commanded	1
the	1
esteem	1
and	1
applause	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
virtuous	1
and	1
disinterested.	1
Considerate	1
men,	1
of	1
every	1
description,	1
ought	1
to	1
prize	1
whatever	1
will	1
tend	1
to	1
beget	1
or	1
fortify	1
that	1
temper	1
in	1
the	1
courts:	1
as	1
no	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
to-morrow	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
injustice,	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
gainer	1
to-day.	1
And	1
every	1
man	1
must	1
now	1
feel,	1
that	1
the	1
inevitable	1
tendency	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
spirit	1
is	1
to	1
sap	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
public	1
and	1
private	1
confidence,	1
and	1
to	1
introduce	1
in	1
its	1
stead	1
universal	1
distrust	1
and	1
distress.	1
That	1
inflexible	1
and	1
uniform	1
adherence	1
to	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
and	1
of	1
individuals,	1
which	1
we	1
perceive	1
to	1
be	1
indispensable	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
justice,	1
can	1
certainly	1
not	1
be	1
expected	1
from	1
judges	1
who	1
hold	1
their	1
offices	1
by	1
a	1
temporary	1
commission.	1
Periodical	1
appointments,	1
however	1
regulated,	1
or	1
by	1
whomsoever	1
made,	1
would,	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
or	1
other,	1
be	1
fatal	1
to	1
their	1
necessary	1
independence.	1
If	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
them	1
was	1
committed	1
either	1
to	1
the	1
Executive	1
or	1
legislature,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
danger	1
of	1
an	1
improper	1
complaisance	1
to	1
the	1
branch	1
which	1
possessed	1
it;	1
if	1
to	1
both,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
unwillingness	1
to	1
hazard	1
the	1
displeasure	1
of	1
either;	1
if	1
to	1
the	1
people,	1
or	1
to	1
persons	1
chosen	1
by	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
special	1
purpose,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
consult	1
popularity,	1
to	1
justify	1
a	1
reliance	1
that	1
nothing	1
would	1
be	1
consulted	1
but	1
the	1
Constitution	1
and	1
the	1
laws.	1
There	1
is	1
yet	1
a	1
further	1
and	1
a	1
weightier	1
reason	1
for	1
the	1
permanency	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
offices,	1
which	1
is	1
deducible	1
from	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
qualifications	1
they	1
require.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
frequently	1
remarked,	1
with	1
great	1
propriety,	1
that	1
a	1
voluminous	1
code	1
of	1
laws	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
inconveniences	1
necessarily	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
a	1
free	1
government.	1
To	1
avoid	1
an	1
arbitrary	1
discretion	1
in	1
the	1
courts,	1
it	1
is	1
indispensable	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
bound	1
down	1
by	1
strict	1
rules	1
and	1
precedents,	1
which	1
serve	1
to	1
define	1
and	1
point	1
out	1
their	1
duty	1
in	1
every	1
particular	1
case	1
that	1
comes	1
before	1
them;	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
readily	1
be	1
conceived	1
from	1
the	1
variety	1
of	1
controversies	1
which	1
grow	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
folly	1
and	1
wickedness	1
of	1
mankind,	1
that	1
the	1
records	1
of	1
those	1
precedents	1
must	1
unavoidably	1
swell	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
considerable	1
bulk,	1
and	1
must	1
demand	1
long	1
and	1
laborious	1
study	1
to	1
acquire	1
a	1
competent	1
knowledge	1
of	1
them.	1
Hence	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
but	1
few	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
who	1
will	1
have	1
sufficient	1
skill	1
in	1
the	1
laws	1
to	1
qualify	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
stations	1
of	1
judges.	1
And	1
making	1
the	1
proper	1
deductions	1
for	1
the	1
ordinary	1
depravity	1
of	1
human	1
nature,	1
the	1
number	1
must	1
be	1
still	1
smaller	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
unite	1
the	1
requisite	1
integrity	1
with	1
the	1
requisite	1
knowledge.	1
These	1
considerations	1
apprise	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
great	1
option	1
between	1
fit	1
character;	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
temporary	1
duration	1
in	1
office,	1
which	1
would	1
naturally	1
discourage	1
such	1
characters	1
from	1
quitting	1
a	1
lucrative	1
line	1
of	1
practice	1
to	1
accept	1
a	1
seat	1
on	1
the	1
bench,	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
throw	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
justice	1
into	1
hands	1
less	1
able,	1
and	1
less	1
well	1
qualified,	1
to	1
conduct	1
it	1
with	1
utility	1
and	1
dignity.	1
In	1
the	1
present	1
circumstances	1
of	1
this	1
country,	1
and	1
in	1
those	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
long	1

the	1
disadvantages	1
on	1
this	1
score	1
would	1
be	1
greater	1
than	1
they	1
may	1
at	1
first	1
sight	1
appear;	1
but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
confessed,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
far	1
inferior	1
to	1
those	1
which	1
present	1
themselves	1
under	1
the	1
other	1
aspects	1
of	1
the	1
subject.	1
Upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
room	1
to	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
convention	1
acted	1
wisely	1
in	1
copying	1
from	1
the	1
models	1
of	1
those	1
constitutions	1
which	1
have	1
established	1
GOOD	1
BEHAVIOR	1
as	1
the	1
tenure	1
of	1
their	1
judicial	1
offices,	1
in	1
point	1
of	1

and	1
that	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
blamable	1
on	1
this	1
account,	1
their	1
plan	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
inexcusably	1
defective,	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
wanted	1
this	1
important	1
feature	1
of	1
good	1
government.	1

To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
NEXT	1
to	1
permanency	1
in	1
office,	1
nothing	1
can	1
contribute	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
independence	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
than	1
a	1
fixed	1
provision	1
for	1
their	1
support.	1
The	1
remark	1
made	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
President	1
is	1
equally	1
applicable	1
here.	1
In	1
the	1
general	1
course	1
of	1
human	1
nature,	1
A	1
POWER	1
OVER	1
A	1
MAN's	1
SUBSISTENCE	1
AMOUNTS	1
TO	1
A	1
POWER	1
OVER	1
HIS	1
WILL.	1
And	1
we	1
can	1
never	1
hope	1
to	1
see	1
realized	1
in	1
practice,	1
the	1
complete	1
separation	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
from	1
the	1
legislative	1
power,	1
in	1
any	1
system	1
which	1
leaves	1
the	1
former	1
dependent	1
for	1
pecuniary	1
resources	1
on	1
the	1
occasional	1
grants	1
of	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
enlightened	1
friends	1
to	1
good	1
government	1
in	1
every	1
State,	1
have	1
seen	1
cause	1
to	1
lament	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
precise	1
and	1
explicit	1
precautions	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
on	1
this	1
head.	1
Some	1
of	1
these	1
indeed	1
have	1
declared	1
that	1
PERMANENT1	1
salaries	1
should	1
be	1
established	1
for	1
the	1
judges;	1
but	1
the	1
experiment	1
has	1
in	1
some	1
instances	1
shown	1
that	1
such	1
expressions	1
are	1
not	1
sufficiently	1
definite	1
to	1
preclude	1
legislative	1
evasions.	1
Something	1
still	1
more	1
positive	1
and	1
unequivocal	1
has	1
been	1
evinced	1
to	1
be	1
requisite.	1
The	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
accordingly	1
has	1
provided	1
that	1
the	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
"shall	1
at	1
STATED	1
TIMES	1
receive	1
for	1
their	1
services	1
a	1
compensation	1
which	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
DIMINISHED	1
during	1
their	1
continuance	1
in	1
office."	1
This,	1
all	1
circumstances	1
considered,	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
eligible	1
provision	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
devised.	1
It	1
will	1
readily	1
be	1
understood	1
that	1
the	1
fluctuations	1
in	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
money	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
society	1
rendered	1
a	1
fixed	1
rate	1
of	1
compensation	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution	1
inadmissible.	1
What	1
might	1
be	1
extravagant	1
to-day,	1
might	1
in	1
half	1
a	1
century	1
become	1
penurious	1
and	1
inadequate.	1
It	1
was	1
therefore	1
necessary	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
to	1
vary	1
its	1
provisions	1
in	1
conformity	1
to	1
the	1
variations	1
in	1
circumstances,	1
yet	1
under	1
such	1
restrictions	1
as	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
that	1
body	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
individual	1
for	1
the	1
worse.	1
A	1
man	1
may	1
then	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
stands,	1
and	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
deterred	1
from	1
his	1
duty	1
by	1
the	1
apprehension	1
of	1
being	1
placed	1
in	1
a	1
less	1
eligible	1
situation.	1
The	1
clause	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
quoted	1
combines	1
both	1
advantages.	1
The	1
salaries	1
of	1
judicial	1
officers	1
may	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
be	1
altered,	1
as	1
occasion	1
shall	1
require,	1
yet	1
so	1
as	1
never	1
to	1
lessen	1
the	1
allowance	1
with	1
which	1
any	1
particular	1
judge	1
comes	1
into	1
office,	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
him.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
observed	1
that	1
a	1
difference	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
between	1
the	1
compensation	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
judges,	1
That	1
of	1
the	1
former	1
can	1
neither	1
be	1
increased	1
nor	1
diminished;	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
can	1
only	1
not	1
be	1
diminished.	1
This	1
probably	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
duration	1
of	1
the	1
respective	1
offices.	1
As	1
the	1
President	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
elected	1
for	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
years,	1
it	1
can	1
rarely	1
happen	1
that	1
an	1
adequate	1
salary,	1
fixed	1
at	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
that	1
period,	1
will	1
not	1
continue	1
to	1
be	1
such	1
to	1
its	1
end.	1
But	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
judges,	1
who,	1
if	1
they	1
behave	1
properly,	1
will	1
be	1
secured	1
in	1
their	1
places	1
for	1
life,	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
happen,	1
especially	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
stages	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
that	1
a	1
stipend,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
sufficient	1
at	1
their	1
first	1
appointment,	1
would	1
become	1
too	1
small	1
in	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
their	1
service.	1
This	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
bears	1
every	1
mark	1
of	1
prudence	1
and	1
efficacy;	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
safely	1
affirmed	1
that,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
permanent	1
tenure	1
of	1
their	1
offices,	1
it	1
affords	1
a	1
better	1
prospect	1
of	1
their	1
independence	1
than	1
is	1
discoverable	1
in	1
the	1
constitutions	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
judges.	1
The	1
precautions	1
for	1
their	1
responsibility	1
are	1
comprised	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
respecting	1
impeachments.	1
They	1
are	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
impeached	1
for	1
malconduct	1
by	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives,	1
and	1
tried	1
by	1
the	1
Senate;	1
and,	1
if	1
convicted,	1
may	1
be	1
dismissed	1
from	1
office,	1
and	1
disqualified	1
for	1
holding	1
any	1
other.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
provision	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
which	1
is	1
consistent	1
with	1
the	1
necessary	1
independence	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
character,	1
and	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
which	1
we	1
find	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
Constitution	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
judges.	1
The	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
provision	1
for	1
removing	1
the	1
judges	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
inability	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
complaint.	1
But	1
all	1
considerate	1
men	1
will	1
be	1
sensible	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
provision	1
would	1
either	1
not	1
be	1
practiced	1
upon	1
or	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
liable	1
to	1
abuse	1
than	1
calculated	1
to	1
answer	1
any	1
good	1
purpose.	1
The	1
mensuration	1
of	1
the	1
faculties	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
has,	1
I	1
believe,	1
no	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
catalogue	1
of	1
known	1
arts.	1
An	1
attempt	1
to	1
fix	1
the	1
boundary	1
between	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
ability	1
and	1
inability,	1
would	1
much	1
oftener	1
give	1
scope	1
to	1
personal	1
and	1
party	1
attachments	1
and	1
enmities	1
than	1
advance	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
justice	1
or	1
the	1
public	1
good.	1
The	1
result,	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
insanity,	1
must	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
be	1
arbitrary;	1
and	1
insanity,	1
without	1
any	1
formal	1
or	1
express	1
provision,	1
may	1
be	1
safely	1
pronounced	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
virtual	1
disqualification.	1
The	1
constitution	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
to	1
avoid	1
investigations	1
that	1
must	1
forever	1
be	1
vague	1
and	1
dangerous,	1
has	1
taken	1
a	1
particular	1
age	1
as	1
the	1
criterion	1
of	1
inability.	1
No	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
a	1
judge	1
beyond	1
sixty.	1
I	1
believe	1
there	1
are	1
few	1
at	1
present	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
disapprove	1
of	1
this	1
provision.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
station,	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
less	1
proper	1
than	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
judge.	1
The	1
deliberating	1
and	1
comparing	1
faculties	1
generally	1
preserve	1
their	1
strength	1
much	1
beyond	1
that	1
period	1
in	1
men	1
who	1
survive	1
it;	1
and	1
when,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
this	1
circumstance,	1
we	1
consider	1
how	1
few	1
there	1
are	1
who	1
outlive	1
the	1
season	1
of	1
intellectual	1
vigor,	1
and	1
how	1
improbable	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
any	1
considerable	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
bench,	1
whether	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
numerous,	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
situation	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
conclude	1
that	1
limitations	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
have	1
little	1
to	1
recommend	1
them.	1
In	1
a	1
republic,	1
where	1
fortunes	1
are	1
not	1
affluent,	1
and	1
pensions	1
not	1
expedient,	1
the	1
dismission	1
of	1
men	1
from	1
stations	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
served	1
their	1
country	1
long	1
and	1
usefully,	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
depend	1
for	1
subsistence,	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
resort	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
occupation	1
for	1
a	1
livelihood,	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
better	1
apology	1
to	1
humanity	1
than	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
imaginary	1
danger	1
of	1
a	1
superannuated	1
bench.	1

JUDGE	1
with	1
accuracy	1
of	1
the	1
proper	1

of	1
the	1

it	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
consider,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1

what	1
are	1

It	1

scarcely	1
to	1
admit	1
of	1
controversy,	1
that	1
the	1

authority	1
of	1
the	1

ought	1
to	1
extend	1
to	1
these	1
several	1
descriptions	1
of	1
cases:	1
1st,	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
which	1
arise	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
passed	1
in	1
pursuance	1
of	1
their	1
just	1
and	1
constitutional	1
powers	1
of	1
legislation;	1
2d,	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
which	1
concern	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
provisions	1
expressly	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
Union;	1
3d,	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
are	1
a	1
party;	1
4th,	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
which	1
involve	1
the	1
PEACE	1
of	1
the	1
CONFEDERACY,	1
whether	1
they	1
relate	1
to	1
the	1
intercourse	1
between	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
and	1
foreign	1
nations,	1
or	1
to	1
that	1
between	1
the	1
States	1
themselves;	1
5th,	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
which	1
originate	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
seas,	1
and	1
are	1
of	1
admiralty	1
or	1
maritime	1
jurisdiction;	1
and,	1
lastly,	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
State	1
tribunals	1
cannot	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
impartial	1
and	1
unbiased.	1
The	1
first	1
point	1
depends	1
upon	1
this	1
obvious	1
consideration,	1
that	1
there	1
ought	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
constitutional	1
method	1
of	1
giving	1
efficacy	1
to	1
constitutional	1
provisions.	1
What,	1
for	1
instance,	1
would	1
avail	1
restrictions	1
on	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
without	1
some	1
constitutional	1
mode	1
of	1
enforcing	1
the	1
observance	1
of	1
them?	1
The	1
States,	1
by	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
are	1
prohibited	1
from	1
doing	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
things,	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
are	1
incompatible	1
with	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
others	1
with	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
good	1
government.	1
The	1
imposition	1
of	1
duties	1
on	1
imported	1
articles,	1
and	1
the	1
emission	1
of	1
paper	1
money,	1
are	1
specimens	1
of	1
each	1
kind.	1
No	1
man	1
of	1
sense	1
will	1
believe,	1
that	1
such	1
prohibitions	1
would	1
be	1
scrupulously	1
regarded,	1
without	1
some	1
effectual	1
power	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
restrain	1
or	1
correct	1
the	1
infractions	1
of	1
them.	1
This	1
power	1
must	1
either	1
be	1
a	1
direct	1
negative	1
on	1
the	1
State	1
laws,	1
or	1
an	1
authority	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
courts	1
to	1
overrule	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
manifest	1
contravention	1
of	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1

There	1
is	1
no	1
third	1
course	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
imagine.	1
The	1
latter	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
thought	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
preferable	1
to	1
the	1
former,	1
and,	1
I	1
presume,	1
will	1
be	1
most	1
agreeable	1
to	1
the	1
States.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
second	1
point,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,	1
by	1
any	1
argument	1
or	1
comment,	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
clearer	1
than	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
itself.	1
If	1
there	1
are	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
political	1
axioms,	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
power	1
of	1
a	1
government	1
being	1
coextensive	1
with	1
its	1
legislative,	1
may	1
be	1
ranked	1
among	1
the	1
number.	1
The	1
mere	1
necessity	1
of	1
uniformity	1
in	1
the	1
interpretation	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
laws,	1
decides	1
the	1
question.	1
Thirteen	1
independent	1
courts	1
of	1
final	1
jurisdiction	1
over	1
the	1
same	1
causes,	1
arising	1
upon	1
the	1
same	1
laws,	1
is	1
a	1
hydra	1
in	1
government,	1
from	1
which	1
nothing	1
but	1
contradiction	1
and	1
confusion	1
can	1
proceed.	1
Still	1
less	1
need	1
be	1
said	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
third	1
point.	1
Controversies	1
between	1
the	1
nation	1
and	1
its	1
members	1
or	1
citizens,	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
properly	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
tribunals.	1
Any	1
other	1
plan	1
would	1
be	1
contrary	1
to	1
reason,	1
to	1
precedent,	1
and	1
to	1
decorum.	1
The	1
fourth	1
point	1
rests	1
on	1
this	1
plain	1
proposition,	1
that	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
WHOLE	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
at	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
a	1
PART.	1
The	1
Union	1
will	1
undoubtedly	1
be	1
answerable	1
to	1
foreign	1
powers	1
for	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
its	1
members.	1
And	1
the	1
responsibility	1
for	1
an	1
injury	1
ought	1
ever	1
to	1
be	1
accompanied	1
with	1
the	1
faculty	1
of	1
preventing	1
it.	1
As	1
the	1
denial	1
or	1
perversion	1
of	1
justice	1
by	1
the	1
sentences	1
of	1
courts,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
manner,	1
is	1
with	1
reason	1
classed	1
among	1
the	1
just	1
causes	1
of	1
war,	1
it	1
will	1
follow	1
that	1
the	1
federal	1
judiciary	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
cognizance	1
of	1
all	1
causes	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
other	1
countries	1
are	1
concerned.	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
less	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
faith,	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
tranquillity.	1
A	1
distinction	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
imagined	1
between	1
cases	1
arising	1
upon	1
treaties	1
and	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
nations	1
and	1
those	1
which	1
may	1
stand	1
merely	1
on	1
the	1
footing	1
of	1
the	1
municipal	1
law.	1
The	1
former	1
kind	1
may	1
be	1
supposed	1
proper	1
for	1
the	1
federal	1
jurisdiction,	1
the	1
latter	1
for	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
at	1
least	1
problematical,	1
whether	1
an	1
unjust	1
sentence	1
against	1
a	1
foreigner,	1
where	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
controversy	1
was	1
wholly	1
relative	1
to	1
the	1
lex	1
loci,	1
would	1
not,	1
if	1
unredressed,	1
be	1
an	1
aggression	1
upon	1
his	1
sovereign,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
one	1
which	1
violated	1
the	1
stipulations	1
of	1
a	1
treaty	1
or	1
the	1
general	1
law	1
of	1
nations.	1
And	1
a	1
still	1
greater	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
distinction	1
would	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
immense	1
difficulty,	1
if	1
not	1
impossibility,	1
of	1
a	1
practical	1
discrimination	1
between	1
the	1
cases	1
of	1
one	1
complexion	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
other.	1
So	1
great	1
a	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
cases	1
in	1
which	1
foreigners	1
are	1
parties,	1
involve	1
national	1
questions,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
far	1
most	1
safe	1
and	1
most	1
expedient	1
to	1
refer	1
all	1
those	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
concerned	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
tribunals.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
determining	1
causes	1
between	1
two	1
States,	1
between	1
one	1
State	1
and	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
another,	1
and	1
between	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
different	1
States,	1
is	1
perhaps	1
not	1
less	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
just	1
examined.	1
History	1
gives	1
us	1
a	1
horrid	1
picture	1
of	1
the	1
dissensions	1
and	1
private	1
wars	1
which	1
distracted	1
and	1
desolated	1
Germany	1
prior	1
to	1
the	1
institution	1
of	1
the	1
Imperial	1
Chamber	1
by	1
Maximilian,	1
towards	1
the	1
close	1
of	1
the	1
fifteenth	1
century;	1
and	1
informs	1
us,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
of	1
the	1
vast	1
influence	1
of	1
that	1
institution	1
in	1
appeasing	1
the	1
disorders	1
and	1
establishing	1
the	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
the	1
empire.	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
court	1
invested	1
with	1
authority	1
to	1
decide	1
finally	1
all	1
differences	1
among	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Germanic	1
body.	1
A	1
method	1
of	1
terminating	1
territorial	1
disputes	1
between	1
the	1
States,	1
under	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
head,	1
was	1
not	1
unattended	1
to,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
imperfect	1
system	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
hitherto	1
held	1
together.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
other	1
sources,	1
besides	1
interfering	1
claims	1
of	1
boundary,	1
from	1
which	1
bickerings	1
and	1
animosities	1
may	1
spring	1
up	1
among	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
To	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
witnesses	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
our	1
past	1
experience.	1
It	1
will	1
readily	1
be	1
conjectured	1
that	1
I	1
allude	1
to	1
the	1
fraudulent	1
laws	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
passed	1
in	1
too	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
And	1
though	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
establishes	1
particular	1
guards	1
against	1
the	1
repetition	1
of	1
those	1
instances	1
which	1
have	1
heretofore	1
made	1
their	1
appearance,	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
warrantable	1
to	1
apprehend	1
that	1
the	1
spirit	1
which	1
produced	1
them	1
will	1
assume	1
new	1
shapes,	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
foreseen	1
nor	1
specifically	1
provided	1
against.	1
Whatever	1
practices	1
may	1
have	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
harmony	1
between	1
the	1
States,	1
are	1
proper	1
objects	1
of	1
federal	1
superintendence	1
and	1
control.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
esteemed	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
that	1
"the	1
citizens	1
of	1
each	1
State	1
shall	1
be	1
entitled	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
privileges	1
and	1
immunities	1
of	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States."	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
just	1
principle	1
that	1
every	1
government	1
OUGHT	1
TO	1
POSSESS	1
THE	1
MEANS	1
OF	1
EXECUTING	1
ITS	1
OWN	1
PROVISIONS	1
BY	1
ITS	1
OWN	1
AUTHORITY,	1
it	1
will	1
follow,	1
that	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
the	1
inviolable	1
maintenance	1
of	1
that	1
equality	1
of	1
privileges	1
and	1
immunities	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
will	1
be	1
entitled,	1
the	1
national	1
judiciary	1
ought	1
to	1
preside	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
in	1
which	1
one	1
State	1
or	1
its	1
citizens	1
are	1
opposed	1
to	1
another	1
State	1
or	1
its	1
citizens.	1
To	1
secure	1
the	1
full	1
effect	1
of	1
so	1
fundamental	1
a	1
provision	1
against	1
all	1
evasion	1
and	1
subterfuge,	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that	1
its	1
construction	1
should	1
be	1
committed	1
to	1
that	1
tribunal	1
which,	1
having	1
no	1
local	1
attachments,	1
will	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
impartial	1
between	1
the	1
different	1
States	1
and	1
their	1
citizens,	1
and	1
which,	1
owing	1
its	1
official	1
existence	1
to	1
the	1
Union,	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
feel	1
any	1
bias	1
inauspicious	1
to	1
the	1
principles	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
founded.	1
The	1
fifth	1
point	1
will	1
demand	1
little	1
animadversion.	1
The	1
most	1
bigoted	1
idolizers	1
of	1
State	1
authority	1
have	1
not	1
thus	1
far	1
shown	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
deny	1
the	1
national	1
judiciary	1
the	1
cognizances	1
of	1
maritime	1
causes.	1
These	1
so	1
generally	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
nations,	1
and	1
so	1
commonly	1
affect	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
foreigners,	1
that	1
they	1
fall	1
within	1
the	1
considerations	1
which	1
are	1
relative	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
peace.	1
The	1
most	1
important	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
are,	1
by	1
the	1
present	1
Confederation,	1
submitted	1
to	1
federal	1
jurisdiction.	1
The	1
reasonableness	1
of	1
the	1
agency	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
courts	1
in	1
cases	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
State	1
tribunals	1
cannot	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
impartial,	1
speaks	1
for	1
itself.	1
No	1
man	1
ought	1
certainly	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
judge	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
cause,	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
cause	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
least	1
interest	1
or	1
bias.	1
This	1
principle	1
has	1
no	1
inconsiderable	1
weight	1
in	1
designating	1
the	1
federal	1
courts	1
as	1
the	1
proper	1
tribunals	1
for	1
the	1
determination	1
of	1
controversies	1
between	1
different	1
States	1
and	1
their	1
citizens.	1
And	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
operation	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
some	1
cases	1
between	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
State.	1
Claims	1
to	1
land	1
under	1
grants	1
of	1
different	1
States,	1
founded	1
upon	1
adverse	1
pretensions	1
of	1
boundary,	1
are	1
of	1
this	1
description.	1
The	1
courts	1
of	1
neither	1
of	1
the	1
granting	1
States	1
could	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
be	1
unbiased.	1
The	1
laws	1
may	1
have	1
even	1
prejudged	1
the	1
question,	1
and	1
tied	1
the	1
courts	1
down	1
to	1
decisions	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
grants	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
belonged.	1
And	1
even	1
where	1
this	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
done,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
natural	1
that	1
the	1
judges,	1
as	1
men,	1
should	1
feel	1
a	1
strong	1
predilection	1
to	1
the	1
claims	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
government.	1
Having	1
thus	1
laid	1
down	1
and	1
discussed	1
the	1
principles	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
judiciary,	1
we	1
will	1
proceed	1
to	1
test,	1
by	1
these	1
principles,	1
the	1
particular	1
powers	1
of	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
composed.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
comprehend	1
"all	1
cases	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
equity	1
arising	1
under	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
and	1
treaties	1
made,	1
or	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
made,	1
under	1
their	1
authority;	1
to	1
all	1
cases	1
affecting	1
ambassadors,	1
other	1
public	1
ministers,	1
and	1
consuls;	1
to	1
all	1
cases	1
of	1
admiralty	1
and	1
maritime	1
jurisdiction;	1
to	1
controversies	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
party;	1
to	1
controversies	1
between	1
two	1
or	1
more	1
States;	1
between	1
a	1
State	1
and	1
citizens	1
of	1
another	1
State;	1
between	1
citizens	1
of	1
different	1
States;	1
between	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
State	1
claiming	1
lands	1
and	1
grants	1
of	1
different	1
States;	1
and	1
between	1
a	1
State	1
or	1
the	1
citizens	1
thereof	1
and	1
foreign	1
states,	1
citizens,	1
and	1
subjects."	1
This	1
constitutes	1
the	1
entire	1
mass	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
review	1
it	1
in	1
detail.	1
It	1
is,	1
then,	1
to	1
extend:	1
First.	1
To	1
all	1
cases	1
in	1
law	1
and	1
equity,	1
ARISING	1
UNDER	1
THE	1
CONSTITUTION	1
and	1
THE	1
LAWS	1
OF	1
THE	1
UNITED	1
STATES.	1
This	1
corresponds	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
first	1
classes	1
of	1
causes,	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
enumerated,	1
as	1
proper	1
for	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
asked,	1
what	1
is	1
meant	1
by	1
"cases	1
arising	1
under	1
the	1
Constitution,"	1
in	1
contradiction	1
from	1
those	1
"arising	1
under	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States"?	1
The	1
difference	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
explained.	1
All	1
the	1
restrictions	1
upon	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
furnish	1
examples	1
of	1
it.	1
They	1
are	1
not,	1
for	1
instance,	1
to	1
emit	1
paper	1
money;	1
but	1
the	1
interdiction	1
results	1
from	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
and	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
connection	1
with	1
any	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
Should	1
paper	1
money,	1
notwithstanding,	1
be	1
emited,	1
the	1
controversies	1
concerning	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
cases	1
arising	1
under	1
the	1
Constitution	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
signification	1
of	1
the	1
terms.	1
This	1
may	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
sample	1
of	1
the	1
whole.	1
It	1
has	1
also	1
been	1
asked,	1
what	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
"equity	1
What	1
equitable	1
causes	1
can	1
grow	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
and	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States?	1
There	1
is	1
hardly	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
litigation	1
between	1
individuals,	1
which	1
may	1
not	1
involve	1
those	1
ingredients	1
of	1
FRAUD,	1
ACCIDENT,	1
TRUST,	1
or	1
HARDSHIP,	1
which	1
would	1
render	1
the	1
matter	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
equitable	1
rather	1
than	1
of	1
legal	1
jurisdiction,	1
as	1
the	1
distinction	1
is	1
known	1
and	1
established	1
in	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
peculiar	1
province,	1
for	1
instance,	1
of	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
equity	1
to	1
relieve	1
against	1
what	1
are	1
called	1
hard	1
bargains:	1
these	1
are	1
contracts	1
in	1
which,	1
though	1
there	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
direct	1
fraud	1
or	1
deceit,	1
sufficient	1
to	1
invalidate	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
law,	1
yet	1
there	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
undue	1
and	1
unconscionable	1
advantage	1
taken	1
of	1
the	1
necessities	1
or	1
misfortunes	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
parties,	1
which	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
equity	1
would	1
not	1
tolerate.	1
In	1
such	1
cases,	1
where	1
foreigners	1
were	1
concerned	1
on	1
either	1
side,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
federal	1
judicatories	1
to	1
do	1
justice	1
without	1
an	1
equitable	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
legal	1
jurisdiction.	1
Agreements	1
to	1
convey	1
lands	1
claimed	1
under	1
the	1
grants	1
of	1
different	1
States,	1
may	1
afford	1
another	1
example	1
of	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
an	1
equitable	1
jurisdiction	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
courts.	1
This	1
reasoning	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
palpable	1
in	1
those	1
States	1
where	1
the	1
formal	1
and	1
technical	1
distinction	1
between	1
LAW	1
and	1
EQUITY	1
is	1
not	1
maintained,	1
as	1
in	1
this	1
State,	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
exemplified	1
by	1
every	1
day's	1
practice.	1
The	1

and	1
to	1
all	1
cases	1
affecting	1

These	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
fourth	1
class	1
of	1
the	1
enumerated	1
cases,	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
an	1

with	1
the	1

Fourth.	1
To	1

which	1
the	1

These	1
belong	1
to	1

and	1
ARE	1
THE	1
ONLY	1
INSTANCES	1
IN	1
WHICH	1

These	1
have	1
been	1
already	1
explained	1
to	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
fourth	1
of	1
the	1
enumerated	1

and	1
have	1
been	1
shown	1
to	1
be,	1
in	1
a	1
peculiar	1
manner,	1
the	1
proper	1
subjects	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
judicature.	1
From	1
this	1
review	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
powers	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
judiciary,	1
as	1
marked	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
conformable	1
to	1
the	1
principles	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
governed	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
that	1
department,	1
and	1
which	1
were	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
perfection	1
of	1
the	1
system.	1
If	1
some	1
partial	1
inconviences	1
should	1
appear	1
to	1
be	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
incorporation	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
plan,	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
recollected	1
that	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
will	1
have	1
ample	1
authority	1
to	1
make	1
such	1
EXCEPTIONS,	1
and	1
to	1
prescribe	1
such	1
regulations	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
calculated	1
to	1
obviate	1
or	1
remove	1
these	1
inconveniences.	1
The	1
possibility	1
of	1
particular	1
mischiefs	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
viewed,	1
by	1
a	1
wellinformed	1
mind,	1
as	1
a	1
solid	1
objection	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
principle,	1
which	1
is	1
calculated	1
to	1
avoid	1
general	1
mischiefs	1
and	1
to	1
obtain	1
general	1
advantages.	1

The	1
Judiciary	1
Continued,	1

Authority	1
From	1
McLEAN's	1
Edition,	1
New	1
York.	1
HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
LET	1
US	1
now	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
partition	1
of	1
the	1
judiciary	1
authority	1
between	1
different	1
courts,	1
and	1
their	1
relations	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
"The	1
judicial	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
is"	1
(by	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention)	1
"to	1
be	1
vested	1
in	1
one	1
Supreme	1
Court,	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
inferior	1
courts	1
as	1
the	1
Congress	1
may,	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
ordain	1
and	1
establish."1	1
That	1
there	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
court	1
of	1
supreme	1
and	1
final	1
jurisdiction,	1
is	1
a	1
proposition	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
contested.	1
The	1
reasons	1
for	1
it	1
have	1
been	1
assigned	1
in	1
another	1
place,	1
and	1
are	1
too	1
obvious	1
to	1
need	1
repetition.	1
The	1
only	1
question	1
that	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
raised	1
concerning	1
it,	1
is,	1
whether	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
distinct	1
body	1
or	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
The	1
same	1
contradiction	1
is	1
observable	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
matter	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
remarked	1
in	1
several	1
other	1
cases.	1
The	1
very	1
men	1
who	1
object	1
to	1
the	1
Senate	1
as	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
impeachments,	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
of	1
an	1
improper	1
intermixture	1
of	1
powers,	1
advocate,	1
by	1
implication	1
at	1
least,	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
vesting	1
the	1
ultimate	1
decision	1
of	1
all	1
causes,	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
The	1
arguments,	1
or	1
rather	1
suggestions,	1
upon	1
which	1
this	1
charge	1
is	1
founded,	1
are	1
to	1
this	1
effect:	1
"The	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
separate	1
and	1
independent	1
body,	1
will	1
be	1
superior	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
construing	1
the	1
laws	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
SPIRIT	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
will	1
enable	1
that	1
court	1
to	1
mould	1
them	1
into	1
whatever	1
shape	1
it	1
may	1
think	1
proper;	1
especially	1
as	1
its	1
decisions	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
manner	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
revision	1
or	1
correction	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
This	1
is	1
as	1
unprecedented	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
dangerous.	1
In	1
Britain,	1
the	1
judical	1
power,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
resort,	1
resides	1
in	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Lords,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
legislature;	1
and	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
government	1
has	1
been	1
imitated	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
in	1
general.	1
The	1
Parliament	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
and	1
the	1
legislatures	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
can	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
rectify,	1
by	1
law,	1
the	1
exceptionable	1
decisions	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
courts.	1
But	1
the	1
errors	1
and	1
usurpations	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
will	1
be	1
uncontrollable	1
and	1
remediless."	1
This,	1
upon	1
examination,	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
up	1
altogether	1
of	1
false	1
reasoning	1
upon	1
misconceived	1
fact.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
syllable	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
under	1
consideration	1
which	1
DIRECTLY	1
empowers	1
the	1
national	1
courts	1
to	1
construe	1
the	1
laws	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
or	1
which	1
gives	1
them	1
any	1
greater	1
latitude	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
than	1
may	1
be	1
claimed	1
by	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
every	1
State.	1
I	1
admit,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
Constitution	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
construction	1
for	1
the	1
laws,	1
and	1
that	1
wherever	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
evident	1
opposition,	1
the	1
laws	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
place	1
to	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
But	1
this	1
doctrine	1
is	1
not	1
deducible	1
from	1
any	1
circumstance	1
peculiar	1
to	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
general	1
theory	1
of	1
a	1
limited	1
Constitution;	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
is	1
equally	1
applicable	1
to	1
most,	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
State	1
governments.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
objection,	1
therefore,	1
on	1
this	1
account,	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
judicature	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
lie	1
against	1
the	1
local	1
judicatures	1
in	1
general,	1
and	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
serve	1
to	1
condemn	1
every	1
constitution	1
that	1
attempts	1
to	1
set	1
bounds	1
to	1
legislative	1
discretion.	1
But	1
perhaps	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
objection	1
may	1
be	1
thought	1
to	1
consist	1
in	1
the	1
particular	1
organization	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court;	1
in	1
its	1
being	1
composed	1
of	1
a	1
distinct	1
body	1
of	1
magistrates,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
State.	1
To	1
insist	1
upon	1
this	1
point,	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
the	1
objection	1
must	1
renounce	1
the	1
meaning	1
they	1
have	1
labored	1
to	1
annex	1
to	1
the	1
celebrated	1
maxim,	1
requiring	1
a	1
separation	1
of	1
the	1
departments	1
of	1
power.	1
It	1
shall,	1
nevertheless,	1
be	1
conceded	1
to	1
them,	1
agreeably	1
to	1
the	1
interpretation	1
given	1
to	1
that	1
maxim	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
papers,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
violated	1
by	1
vesting	1
the	1
ultimate	1
power	1
of	1
judging	1
in	1
a	1
PART	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body.	1
But	1
though	1
this	1
be	1
not	1
an	1
absolute	1
violation	1
of	1
that	1
excellent	1
rule,	1
yet	1
it	1
verges	1
so	1
nearly	1
upon	1
it,	1
as	1
on	1
this	1
account	1
alone	1
to	1
be	1
less	1
eligible	1
than	1
the	1
mode	1
preferred	1
by	1
the	1
convention.	1
From	1
a	1
body	1
which	1
had	1
even	1
a	1
partial	1
agency	1
in	1
passing	1
bad	1
laws,	1
we	1
could	1
rarely	1
expect	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
temper	1
and	1
moderate	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
application.	1
The	1
same	1
spirit	1
which	1
had	1
operated	1
in	1
making	1
them,	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
apt	1
in	1
interpreting	1
them;	1
still	1
less	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
expected	1
that	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
infringed	1
the	1
Constitution	1
in	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
legislators,	1
would	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
repair	1
the	1
breach	1
in	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
judges.	1
Nor	1
is	1
this	1
all.	1
Every	1
reason	1
which	1
recommends	1
the	1
tenure	1
of	1
good	1
behavior	1
for	1
judicial	1
offices,	1
militates	1
against	1
placing	1
the	1
judiciary	1
power,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
resort,	1
in	1
a	1
body	1
composed	1
of	1
men	1
chosen	1
for	1
a	1
limited	1
period.	1
There	1
is	1
an	1
absurdity	1
in	1
referring	1
the	1
determination	1
of	1
causes,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance,	1
to	1
judges	1
of	1
permanent	1
standing;	1
in	1
the	1
last,	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
temporary	1
and	1
mutable	1
constitution.	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
still	1
greater	1
absurdity	1
in	1
subjecting	1
the	1
decisions	1
of	1
men,	1
selected	1
for	1
their	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
laws,	1
acquired	1
by	1
long	1
and	1
laborious	1
study,	1
to	1
the	1
revision	1
and	1
control	1
of	1
men	1
who,	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
advantage,	1
cannot	1
but	1
be	1
deficient	1
in	1
that	1
knowledge.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
will	1
rarely	1
be	1
chosen	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
those	1
qualifications	1
which	1
fit	1
men	1
for	1
the	1
stations	1
of	1
judges;	1
and	1
as,	1
on	1
this	1
account,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
great	1
reason	1
to	1
apprehend	1
all	1
the	1
ill	1
consequences	1
of	1
defective	1
information,	1
so,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
propensity	1
of	1
such	1
bodies	1
to	1
party	1
divisions,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
less	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
the	1
pestilential	1
breath	1
of	1
faction	1
may	1
poison	1
the	1
fountains	1
of	1
justice.	1
The	1
habit	1
of	1
being	1
continually	1
marshalled	1
on	1
opposite	1
sides	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
apt	1
to	1
stifle	1
the	1
voice	1
both	1
of	1
law	1
and	1
of	1
equity.	1
These	1
considerations	1
teach	1
us	1
to	1
applaud	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
those	1
States	1
who	1
have	1
committed	1
the	1
judicial	1
power,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
resort,	1
not	1
to	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
but	1
to	1
distinct	1
and	1
independent	1
bodies	1
of	1
men.	1
Contrary	1
to	1
the	1
supposition	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
represented	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
in	1
this	1
respect,	1
as	1
novel	1
and	1
unprecedented,	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
copy	1
of	1
the	1
constitutions	1
of	1
New	1
Hampshire,	1
Massachusetts,	1
Pennsylvania,	1
Delaware,	1
Maryland,	1
Virginia,	1
North	1
Carolina,	1
South	1
Carolina,	1
and	1
Georgia;	1
and	1
the	1
preference	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
those	1
models	1
is	1
highly	1
to	1
be	1
commended.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
true,	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
place,	1
that	1
the	1
Parliament	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
or	1
the	1
legislatures	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
States,	1
can	1
rectify	1
the	1
exceptionable	1
decisions	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
courts,	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
sense	1
than	1
might	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
a	1
future	1
legislature	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
The	1
theory,	1
neither	1
of	1
the	1
British,	1
nor	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
authorizes	1
the	1
revisal	1
of	1
a	1
judicial	1
sentence	1
by	1
a	1
legislative	1
act.	1
Nor	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
more	1
than	1
in	1
either	1
of	1
them,	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
forbidden.	1
In	1
the	1
former,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
latter,	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
the	1
thing,	1
on	1
the	1
general	1
principles	1
of	1
law	1
and	1
reason,	1
is	1
the	1
sole	1
obstacle.	1
A	1
legislature,	1
without	1
exceeding	1
its	1
province,	1
cannot	1
reverse	1
a	1
determination	1
once	1
made	1
in	1
a	1
particular	1
case;	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
prescribe	1
a	1
new	1
rule	1
for	1
future	1
cases.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
principle,	1
and	1
it	1
applies	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
consequences,	1
exactly	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
and	1
extent,	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
now	1
under	1
consideration.	1
Not	1
the	1
least	1
difference	1
can	1
be	1
pointed	1
out	1
in	1
any	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
subject.	1
It	1
may	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
place	1
be	1
observed	1
that	1
the	1
supposed	1
danger	1
of	1
judiciary	1
encroachments	1
on	1
the	1
legislative	1
authority,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
upon	1
many	1
occasions	1
reiterated,	1
is	1
in	1
reality	1
a	1
phantom.	1
Particular	1
misconstructions	1
and	1
contraventions	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
may	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
happen;	1
but	1
they	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
so	1
extensive	1
as	1
to	1
amount	1
to	1
an	1
inconvenience,	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
sensible	1
degree	1
to	1
affect	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
political	1
system.	1
This	1
may	1
be	1
inferred	1
with	1
certainty,	1
from	1
the	1
general	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
power,	1
from	1
the	1
objects	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
relates,	1
from	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
exercised,	1
from	1
its	1
comparative	1
weakness,	1
and	1
from	1
its	1
total	1
incapacity	1
to	1
support	1
its	1
usurpations	1
by	1
force.	1
And	1
the	1
inference	1
is	1
greatly	1
fortified	1
by	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
the	1
important	1
constitutional	1
check	1
which	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
instituting	1
impeachments	1
in	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
legislative	1
body,	1
and	1
of	1
determining	1
upon	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
would	1
give	1
to	1
that	1
body	1
upon	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
department.	1
This	1
is	1
alone	1
a	1
complete	1
security.	1
There	1
never	1
can	1
be	1
danger	1
that	1
the	1
judges,	1
by	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
deliberate	1
usurpations	1
on	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
legislature,	1
would	1
hazard	1
the	1
united	1
resentment	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
intrusted	1
with	1
it,	1
while	1
this	1
body	1
was	1
possessed	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
punishing	1
their	1
presumption,	1
by	1
degrading	1
them	1
from	1
their	1
stations.	1
While	1
this	1
ought	1
to	1
remove	1
all	1
apprehensions	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
it	1
affords,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
a	1
cogent	1
argument	1
for	1
constituting	1
the	1
Senate	1
a	1
court	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
impeachments.	1
Having	1
now	1
examined,	1
and,	1
I	1
trust,	1
removed	1
the	1
objections	1
to	1
the	1
distinct	1
and	1
independent	1
organization	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court,	1
I	1
proceed	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
constituting	1
inferior	1
courts,2	1
and	1
the	1
relations	1
which	1
will	1
subsist	1
between	1
these	1
and	1
the	1
former.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
constituting	1
inferior	1
courts	1
is	1
evidently	1
calculated	1
to	1
obviate	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
having	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
of	1
federal	1
cognizance.	1
It	1
is	1
intended	1
to	1
enable	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
to	1
institute	1
or	1
AUTHORUZE,	1
in	1
each	1
State	1
or	1
district	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
a	1
tribunal	1
competent	1
to	1
the	1
determination	1
of	1
matters	1
of	1
national	1
jurisdiction	1
within	1
its	1
limits.	1
But	1
why,	1
it	1
is	1
asked,	1
might	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
purpose	1
have	1
been	1
accomplished	1
by	1
the	1
instrumentality	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
courts?	1
This	1
admits	1
of	1
different	1
answers.	1
Though	1
the	1
fitness	1
and	1
competency	1
of	1
those	1
courts	1
should	1
be	1
allowed	1
in	1
the	1
utmost	1
latitude,	1
yet	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
in	1
question	1
may	1
still	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
necessary	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
plan,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
to	1
empower	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
to	1
commit	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
cognizance	1
of	1
causes	1
arising	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
Constitution.	1
To	1
confer	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
determining	1
such	1
causes	1
upon	1
the	1
existing	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States,	1
would	1
perhaps	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
"to	1
constitute	1
tribunals,"	1
as	1
to	1
create	1
new	1
courts	1
with	1
the	1
like	1
power.	1
But	1
ought	1
not	1
a	1
more	1
direct	1
and	1
explicit	1
provision	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
courts?	1
There	1
are,	1
in	1
my	1
opinion,	1
substantial	1
reasons	1
against	1
such	1
a	1
provision:	1
the	1
most	1
discerning	1
cannot	1
foresee	1
how	1
far	1
the	1
prevalency	1
of	1
a	1
local	1
spirit	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
to	1
disqualify	1
the	1
local	1
tribunals	1
for	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
national	1
causes;	1
whilst	1
every	1
man	1
may	1
discover,	1
that	1
courts	1
constituted	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
would	1
be	1
improper	1
channels	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
State	1
judges,	1
holding	1
their	1
offices	1
during	1
pleasure,	1
or	1
from	1
year	1
to	1
year,	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
little	1
independent	1
to	1
be	1
relied	1
upon	1
for	1
an	1
inflexible	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
laws.	1
And	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
necessity	1
for	1
confiding	1
the	1
original	1
cognizance	1
of	1
causes	1
arising	1
under	1
those	1
laws	1
to	1
them	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
correspondent	1
necessity	1
for	1
leaving	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
appeal	1
as	1
wide	1
as	1
possible.	1
In	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
grounds	1
of	1
confidence	1
in,	1
or	1
distrust	1
of,	1
the	1
subordinate	1
tribunals,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
facility	1
or	1
difficulty	1
of	1
appeals.	1
And	1
well	1
satisfied	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
the	1
appellate	1
jurisdiction,	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
classes	1
of	1
causes	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
extended	1
by	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention.	1
I	1
should	1
consider	1
every	1
thing	1
calculated	1
to	1
give,	1
in	1
practice,	1
an	1
UNRESTRAINED	1
COURSE	1
to	1
appeals,	1
as	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
public	1
and	1
private	1
inconvenience.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sure,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
highly	1
expedient	1
and	1
useful,	1
to	1
divide	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
into	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
or	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
districts;	1
and	1
to	1
institute	1
a	1
federal	1
court	1
in	1
each	1
district,	1
in	1
lieu	1
of	1
one	1
in	1
every	1
State.	1
The	1
judges	1
of	1
these	1
courts,	1
with	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
judges,	1
may	1
hold	1
circuits	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
causes	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
respective	1
districts.	1
Justice	1
through	1
them	1
may	1
be	1
administered	1
with	1
ease	1
and	1
despatch;	1
and	1
appeals	1
may	1
be	1
safely	1
circumscribed	1
within	1
a	1
narrow	1
compass.	1
This	1
plan	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
present	1
the	1
most	1
eligible	1
of	1
any	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
adopted;	1
and	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
it,	1
it	1
is	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
constituting	1
inferior	1
courts	1
should	1
exist	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
extent	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution.	1
These	1
reasons	1
seem	1
sufficient	1
to	1
satisfy	1
a	1
candid	1
mind,	1
that	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
power	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
defect	1
in	1
the	1
plan.	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
examine	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
the	1
judicial	1
authority	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
distributed	1
between	1
the	1
supreme	1
and	1
the	1
inferior	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
The	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
invested	1
with	1
original	1
jurisdiction,	1
only	1
"in	1
cases	1
affecting	1
ambassadors,	1
other	1
public	1
ministers,	1
and	1
consuls,	1
and	1
those	1
in	1
which	1
A	1
STATE	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
party."	1
Public	1
ministers	1
of	1
every	1
class	1
are	1
the	1
immediate	1
representatives	1
of	1
their	1
sovereigns.	1
All	1
questions	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
concerned	1
are	1
so	1
directly	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
public	1
peace,	1
that,	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
this,	1
as	1
out	1
of	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
sovereignties	1
they	1
represent,	1
it	1
is	1
both	1
expedient	1
and	1
proper	1
that	1
such	1
questions	1
should	1
be	1
submitted	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
judicatory	1
of	1
the	1
nation.	1
Though	1
consuls	1
have	1
not	1
in	1
strictness	1
a	1
diplomatic	1
character,	1
yet	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
public	1
agents	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
belong,	1
the	1
same	1
observation	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure	1
applicable	1
to	1
them.	1
In	1
cases	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
State	1
might	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
party,	1
it	1
would	1
ill	1
suit	1
its	1
dignity	1
to	1
be	1
turned	1
over	1
to	1
an	1
inferior	1
tribunal.	1
Though	1
it	1
may	1
rather	1
be	1
a	1
digression	1
from	1
the	1
immediate	1
subject	1
of	1
this	1
paper,	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
occasion	1
to	1
mention	1
here	1
a	1
supposition	1
which	1
has	1
excited	1
some	1
alarm	1
upon	1
very	1
mistaken	1
grounds.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
suggested	1
that	1
an	1
assignment	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
securities	1
of	1
one	1
State	1
to	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
another,	1
would	1
enable	1
them	1
to	1
prosecute	1
that	1
State	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
courts	1
for	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
those	1
securities;	1
a	1
suggestion	1
which	1
the	1
following	1
considerations	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
without	1
foundation.	1
It	1
is	1
inherent	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
sovereignty	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
amenable	1
to	1
the	1
suit	1
of	1
an	1
individual	1
WITHOUT	1
ITS	1
CONSENT.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
general	1
sense,	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
practice	1
of	1
mankind;	1
and	1
the	1
exemption,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
attributes	1
of	1
sovereignty,	1
is	1
now	1
enjoyed	1
by	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
every	1
State	1
in	1
the	1
Union.	1
Unless,	1
therefore,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
surrender	1
of	1
this	1
immunity	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
it	1
will	1
remain	1
with	1
the	1
States,	1
and	1
the	1
danger	1
intimated	1
must	1
be	1
merely	1
ideal.	1
The	1
circumstances	1
which	1
are	1
necessary	1
to	1
produce	1
an	1
alienation	1
of	1
State	1
sovereignty	1
were	1
discussed	1
in	1
considering	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
taxation,	1
and	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
repeated	1
here.	1
A	1
recurrence	1
to	1
the	1
principles	1
there	1
established	1
will	1
satisfy	1
us,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
color	1
to	1
pretend	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
would,	1
by	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
that	1
plan,	1
be	1
divested	1
of	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
paying	1
their	1
own	1
debts	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
way,	1
free	1
from	1
every	1
constraint	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
flows	1
from	1
the	1
obligations	1
of	1
good	1
faith.	1
The	1
contracts	1
between	1
a	1
nation	1
and	1
individuals	1
are	1
only	1
binding	1
on	1
the	1
conscience	1
of	1
the	1
sovereign,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
pretensions	1
to	1
a	1
compulsive	1
force.	1
They	1
confer	1
no	1
right	1
of	1
action,	1
independent	1
of	1
the	1
sovereign	1
will.	1
To	1
what	1
purpose	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
authorize	1
suits	1
against	1
States	1
for	1
the	1
debts	1
they	1
owe?	1
How	1
could	1
recoveries	1
be	1
enforced?	1
It	1
is	1
evident,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
done	1
without	1
waging	1
war	1
against	1
the	1
contracting	1
State;	1
and	1
to	1
ascribe	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
courts,	1
by	1
mere	1
implication,	1
and	1
in	1
destruction	1
of	1
a	1
pre-existing	1
right	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments,	1
a	1
power	1
which	1
would	1
involve	1
such	1
a	1
consequence,	1
would	1
be	1
altogether	1
forced	1
and	1
unwarrantable.	1
Let	1
us	1
resume	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
our	1
observations.	1
We	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
the	1
original	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
would	1
be	1
confined	1
to	1
two	1
classes	1
of	1
causes,	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
nature	1
rarely	1
to	1
occur.	1
In	1
all	1
other	1
cases	1
of	1
federal	1
cognizance,	1
the	1
original	1
jurisdiction	1
would	1
appertain	1
to	1
the	1
inferior	1
tribunals;	1
and	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
would	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
appellate	1
jurisdiction,	1
"with	1
such	1
EXCEPTIONS	1
and	1
under	1
such	1
REGULATIONS	1
as	1
the	1
Congress	1
shall	1
make."	1
The	1
propriety	1
of	1
this	1
appellate	1
jurisdiction	1
has	1
been	1
scarcely	1
called	1
in	1
question	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
matters	1
of	1
law;	1
but	1
the	1
clamors	1
have	1
been	1
loud	1
against	1
it	1
as	1
applied	1
to	1
matters	1
of	1
fact.	1
Some	1
well-intentioned	1
men	1
in	1
this	1
State,	1
deriving	1
their	1
notions	1
from	1
the	1
language	1
and	1
forms	1
which	1
obtain	1
in	1
our	1
courts,	1
have	1
been	1
induced	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
implied	1
supersedure	1
of	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury,	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
civil-law	1
mode	1
of	1
trial,	1
which	1
prevails	1
in	1
our	1
courts	1
of	1
admiralty,	1
probate,	1
and	1
chancery.	1
A	1
technical	1
sense	1
has	1
been	1
affixed	1
to	1
the	1
term	1
"appellate,"	1
which,	1
in	1
our	1
law	1
parlance,	1
is	1
commonly	1
used	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
appeals	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
civil	1
law.	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
misinformed,	1
the	1
same	1
meaning	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
it	1
in	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
New	1
England.	1
There	1
an	1
appeal	1
from	1
one	1
jury	1
to	1
another,	1
is	1
familiar	1
both	1
in	1
language	1
and	1
practice,	1
and	1
is	1
even	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
course,	1
until	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
two	1
verdicts	1
on	1
one	1
side.	1
The	1
word	1
"appellate,"	1
therefore,	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
understood	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
sense	1
in	1
New	1
England	1
as	1
in	1
New	1
York,	1
which	1
shows	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
a	1
technical	1
interpretation	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
jurisprudence	1
of	1
any	1
particular	1
State.	1
The	1
expression,	1
taken	1
in	1
the	1
abstract,	1
denotes	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
one	1
tribunal	1
to	1
review	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
another,	1
either	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
or	1
fact,	1
or	1
both.	1
The	1
mode	1
of	1
doing	1
it	1
may	1
depend	1
on	1
ancient	1
custom	1
or	1
legislative	1
provision	1
(in	1
a	1
new	1
government	1
it	1
must	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
latter),	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
with	1
or	1
without	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
a	1
jury,	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
judged	1
advisable.	1
If,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
re-examination	1
of	1
a	1
fact	1
once	1
determined	1
by	1
a	1
jury,	1
should	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
be	1
admitted	1
under	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
so	1
regulated	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
a	1
second	1
jury,	1
either	1
by	1
remanding	1
the	1
cause	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
below	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
trial	1
of	1
the	1
fact,	1
or	1
by	1
directing	1
an	1
issue	1
immediately	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court.	1
But	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
follow	1
that	1
the	1
re-examination	1
of	1
a	1
fact	1
once	1
ascertained	1
by	1
a	1
jury,	1
will	1
be	1
permitted	1
in	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court.	1
Why	1
may	1
not	1
it	1
be	1
said,	1
with	1
the	1
strictest	1
propriety,	1
when	1
a	1
writ	1
of	1
error	1
is	1
brought	1
from	1
an	1
inferior	1
to	1
a	1
superior	1
court	1
of	1
law	1
in	1
this	1
State,	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
has	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
law?	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
it	1
cannot	1
institute	1
a	1
new	1
inquiry	1
concerning	1
the	1
fact,	1
but	1
it	1
takes	1
cognizance	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
it	1
appears	1
upon	1
the	1
record,	1
and	1
pronounces	1
the	1
law	1
arising	1
upon	1
it.3	1
This	1
is	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
both	1
fact	1
and	1
law;	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
even	1
possible	1
to	1
separate	1
them.	1
Though	1
the	1
common-law	1
courts	1
of	1
this	1
State	1
ascertain	1
disputed	1
facts	1
by	1
a	1
jury,	1
yet	1
they	1
unquestionably	1
have	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
both	1
fact	1
and	1
law;	1
and	1
accordingly	1
when	1
the	1
former	1
is	1
agreed	1
in	1
the	1
pleadings,	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
recourse	1
to	1
a	1
jury,	1
but	1
proceed	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
judgment.	1
I	1
contend,	1
therefore,	1
on	1
this	1
ground,	1
that	1
the	1
expressions,	1
"appellate	1
jurisdiction,	1
both	1
as	1
to	1
law	1
and	1
fact,"	1
do	1
not	1
necessarily	1
imply	1
a	1
re-examination	1
in	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
of	1
facts	1
decided	1
by	1
juries	1
in	1
the	1
inferior	1
courts.	1
The	1
following	1
train	1
of	1
ideas	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
imagined	1
to	1
have	1
influenced	1
the	1
convention,	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
this	1
particular	1
provision.	1
The	1
appellate	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
(it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
argued)	1
will	1
extend	1
to	1
causes	1
determinable	1
in	1
different	1
modes,	1
some	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
COMMON	1
LAW,	1
others	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
CIVIL	1
LAW.	1
In	1
the	1
former,	1
the	1
revision	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
only	1
will	1
be,	1
generally	1
speaking,	1
the	1
proper	1
province	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court;	1
in	1
the	1
latter,	1
the	1
re-examination	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
agreeable	1
to	1
usage,	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
cases,	1
of	1
which	1
prize	1
causes	1
are	1
an	1
example,	1
might	1
be	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
peace.	1
It	1
is	1
therefore	1
necessary	1
that	1
the	1
appellate	1
jurisdiction	1
should,	1
in	1
certain	1
cases,	1
extend	1
in	1
the	1
broadest	1
sense	1
to	1
matters	1
of	1
fact.	1
It	1
will	1
not	1
answer	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
express	1
exception	1
of	1
cases	1
which	1
shall	1
have	1
been	1
originally	1
tried	1
by	1
a	1
jury,	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
ALL	1
CAUSES	1
are	1
tried	1
in	1
this	1
mode4;	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
exception	1
would	1
preclude	1
the	1
revision	1
of	1
matters	1
of	1
fact,	1
as	1
well	1
where	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
proper,	1
as	1
where	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
improper.	1
To	1
avoid	1
all	1
inconveniencies,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
safest	1
to	1
declare	1
generally,	1
that	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
shall	1
possess	1
appellate	1
jurisdiction	1
both	1
as	1
to	1
law	1
and	1
FACT,	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
jurisdiction	1
shall	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
such	1
EXCEPTIONS	1
and	1
regulations	1
as	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
may	1
prescribe.	1
This	1
will	1
enable	1
the	1
government	1
to	1
modify	1
it	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
will	1
best	1
answer	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
public	1
justice	1
and	1
security.	1
This	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
puts	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
supposed	1
ABOLITION	1
of	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury,	1
by	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
this	1
provision,	1
is	1
fallacious	1
and	1
untrue.	1
The	1
legislature	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
full	1
power	1
to	1
provide,	1
that	1
in	1
appeals	1
to	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
re-examination	1
of	1
facts	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
tried	1
in	1
the	1
original	1
causes	1
by	1
juries.	1
This	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
an	1
authorized	1
exception;	1
but	1
if,	1
for	1
the	1
reason	1
already	1
intimated,	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
thought	1
too	1
extensive,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
qualified	1
with	1
a	1
limitation	1
to	1
such	1
causes	1
only	1
as	1
are	1
determinable	1
at	1
common	1
law	1
in	1
that	1
mode	1
of	1
trial.	1
The	1
amount	1
of	1
the	1
observations	1
hitherto	1
made	1
on	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
judicial	1
department	1
is	1
this:	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
carefully	1
restricted	1
to	1
those	1
causes	1
which	1
are	1
manifestly	1
proper	1
for	1
the	1
cognizance	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
judicature;	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
partition	1
of	1
this	1
authority	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
portion	1
of	1
original	1
jurisdiction	1
has	1
been	1
preserved	1
to	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
consigned	1
to	1
the	1
subordinate	1
tribunals;	1
that	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
will	1
possess	1
an	1
appellate	1
jurisdiction,	1
both	1
as	1
to	1
law	1
and	1
fact,	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
cases	1
referred	1
to	1
them,	1
both	1
subject	1
to	1
any	1
EXCEPTIONS	1
and	1
REGULATIONS	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
thought	1
advisable;	1
that	1
this	1
appellate	1
jurisdiction	1
does,	1
in	1
no	1
case,	1
ABOLISH	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury;	1
and	1
that	1
an	1
ordinary	1
degree	1
of	1
prudence	1
and	1
integrity	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
councils	1
will	1
insure	1
us	1
solid	1
advantages	1
from	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
judiciary,	1
without	1
exposing	1
us	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
inconveniences	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
predicted	1
from	1
that	1
source.	1

This	1

has	1

represented	1
as	1
intended	1
to	1
abolish	1
all	1
the	1
county	1

in	1

are	1

the	1

of	1
the	1

are,	1
to	1
constitute	1
"tribunals	1
INFERIOR	1

and	1
the	1
evident	1
design	1
of	1
the	1

is	1
to	1
enable	1
the	1

of	1
local	1

THE	1
erection	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
government,	1
whatever	1
care	1
or	1
wisdom	1
may	1
distinguish	1
the	1
work,	1
cannot	1
fail	1
to	1
originate	1
questions	1
of	1
intricacy	1
and	1
nicety;	1
and	1
these	1
may,	1
in	1
a	1
particular	1
manner,	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
flow	1
from	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
a	1
constitution	1
founded	1
upon	1
the	1
total	1
or	1
partial	1
incorporation	1
of	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
distinct	1
sovereignties.	1
'T	1
is	1
time	1
only	1
that	1
can	1
mature	1
and	1
perfect	1
so	1
compound	1
a	1
system,	1
can	1
liquidate	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
parts,	1
and	1
can	1
adjust	1
them	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
a	1
harmonious	1
and	1
consistent	1
WHOLE.	1
Such	1
questions,	1
accordingly,	1
have	1
arisen	1
upon	1
the	1
plan	1
proposed	1
by	1
the	1
convention,	1
and	1
particularly	1
concerning	1
the	1
judiciary	1
department.	1
The	1
principal	1
of	1
these	1
respect	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
courts	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
those	1
causes	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
submitted	1
to	1
federal	1
jurisdiction.	1
Is	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
exclusive,	1
or	1
are	1
those	1
courts	1
to	1
possess	1
a	1
concurrent	1
jurisdiction?	1
If	1
the	1
latter,	1
in	1
what	1
relation	1
will	1
they	1
stand	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
tribunals?	1
These	1
are	1
inquiries	1
which	1
we	1
meet	1
with	1
in	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
sense,	1
and	1
which	1
are	1
certainly	1
entitled	1
to	1
attention.	1
The	1
principles	1
established	1
in	1
a	1
former	1
paper1	1
teach	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
States	1
will	1
retain	1
all	1
PRE-EXISTING	1
authorities	1
which	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
exclusively	1
delegated	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
head;	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
exclusive	1
delegation	1
can	1
only	1
exist	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
three	1
cases:	1
where	1
an	1
exclusive	1
authority	1
is,	1
in	1
express	1
terms,	1
granted	1
to	1
the	1
Union;	1
or	1
where	1
a	1
particular	1
authority	1
is	1
granted	1
to	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
a	1
like	1
authority	1
is	1
prohibited	1
to	1
the	1
States;	1
or	1
where	1
an	1
authority	1
is	1
granted	1
to	1
the	1
Union,	1
with	1
which	1
a	1
similar	1
authority	1
in	1
the	1
States	1
would	1
be	1
utterly	1
incompatible.	1
Though	1
these	1
principles	1
may	1
not	1
apply	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
force	1
to	1
the	1
judiciary	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
legislative	1
power,	1
yet	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
are,	1
in	1
the	1
main,	1
just	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
former,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
latter.	1
And	1
under	1
this	1
impression,	1
I	1
shall	1
lay	1
it	1
down	1
as	1
a	1
rule,	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
courts	1
will	1
RETAIN	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
they	1
now	1
have,	1
unless	1
it	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
enumerated	1
modes.	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
which	1
wears	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
confining	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
federal	1
cognizance	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
courts,	1
is	1
contained	1
in	1
this	1
passage:	1
"The	1
JUDICIAL	1
POWER	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
SHALL	1
BE	1
VESTED	1
in	1
one	1
Supreme	1
Court,	1
and	1
in	1
SUCH	1
inferior	1
courts	1
as	1
the	1
Congress	1
shall	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
ordain	1
and	1
establish."	1
This	1
might	1
either	1
be	1
construed	1
to	1
signify,	1
that	1
the	1
supreme	1
and	1
subordinate	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
should	1
alone	1
have	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
deciding	1
those	1
causes	1
to	1
which	1
their	1
authority	1
is	1
to	1
extend;	1
or	1
simply	1
to	1
denote,	1
that	1
the	1
organs	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
judiciary	1
should	1
be	1
one	1
Supreme	1
Court,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
subordinate	1
courts	1
as	1
Congress	1
should	1
think	1
proper	1
to	1
appoint;	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
that	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
should	1
exercise	1
the	1
judicial	1
power	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
invested,	1
through	1
one	1
supreme	1
tribunal,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
number	1
of	1
inferior	1
ones,	1
to	1
be	1
instituted	1
by	1
them.	1
The	1
first	1
excludes,	1
the	1
last	1
admits,	1
the	1
concurrent	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
tribunals;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
would	1
amount	1
to	1
an	1
alienation	1
of	1
State	1
power	1
by	1
implication,	1
the	1
last	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
most	1
natural	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
defensible	1
construction.	1
But	1
this	1
doctrine	1
of	1
concurrent	1
jurisdiction	1
is	1
only	1
clearly	1
applicable	1
to	1
those	1
descriptions	1
of	1
causes	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
State	1
courts	1
have	1
previous	1
cognizance.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
equally	1
evident	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
cases	1
which	1
may	1
grow	1
out	1
of,	1
and	1
be	1
PECULIAR	1
to,	1
the	1
Constitution	1
to	1
be	1
established;	1
for	1
not	1
to	1
allow	1
the	1
State	1
courts	1
a	1
right	1
of	1
jurisdiction	1
in	1
such	1
cases,	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
the	1
abridgment	1
of	1
a	1
pre-existing	1
authority.	1
I	1
mean	1
not	1
therefore	1
to	1
contend	1
that	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
legislation	1
upon	1
the	1
objects	1
intrusted	1
to	1
their	1
direction,	1
may	1
not	1
commit	1
the	1
decision	1
of	1
causes	1
arising	1
upon	1
a	1
particular	1
regulation	1
to	1
the	1
federal	1
courts	1
solely,	1
if	1
such	1
a	1
measure	1
should	1
be	1
deemed	1
expedient;	1
but	1
I	1
hold	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
courts	1
will	1
be	1
divested	1
of	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
primitive	1
jurisdiction,	1
further	1
than	1
may	1
relate	1
to	1
an	1
appeal;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
even	1
of	1
opinion	1
that	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
expressly	1
excluded	1
by	1
the	1
future	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
legislature,	1
they	1
will	1
of	1
course	1
take	1
cognizance	1
of	1
the	1
causes	1
to	1
which	1
those	1
acts	1
may	1
give	1
birth.	1
This	1
I	1
infer	1
from	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
judiciary	1
power,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
general	1
genius	1
of	1
the	1
system.	1
The	1
judiciary	1
power	1
of	1
every	1
government	1
looks	1
beyond	1
its	1
own	1
local	1
or	1
municipal	1
laws,	1
and	1
in	1
civil	1
cases	1
lays	1
hold	1
of	1
all	1
subjects	1
of	1
litigation	1
between	1
parties	1
within	1
its	1
jurisdiction,	1
though	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
dispute	1
are	1
relative	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
distant	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
globe.	1
Those	1
of	1
Japan,	1
not	1
less	1
than	1
of	1
New	1
York,	1
may	1
furnish	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
legal	1
discussion	1
to	1
our	1
courts.	1
When	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
this	1
we	1
consider	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
and	1
the	1
national	1
governments,	1
as	1
they	1
truly	1
are,	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
kindred	1
systems,	1
and	1
as	1
parts	1
of	1
ONE	1
WHOLE,	1
the	1
inference	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
conclusive,	1
that	1
the	1
State	1
courts	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
concurrent	1
jurisdiction	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
arising	1
under	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
expressly	1
prohibited.	1
Here	1
another	1
question	1
occurs:	1
What	1
relation	1
would	1
subsist	1
between	1
the	1
national	1
and	1
State	1
courts	1
in	1
these	1
instances	1
of	1
concurrent	1
jurisdiction?	1
I	1
answer,	1
that	1
an	1
appeal	1
would	1
certainly	1
lie	1
from	1
the	1
latter,	1
to	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
The	1
Constitution	1
in	1
direct	1
terms	1
gives	1
an	1
appellate	1
jurisdiction	1
to	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
enumerated	1
cases	1
of	1
federal	1
cognizance	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
original	1
one,	1
without	1
a	1
single	1
expression	1
to	1
confine	1
its	1
operation	1
to	1
the	1
inferior	1
federal	1
courts.	1
The	1
objects	1
of	1
appeal,	1
not	1
the	1
tribunals	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
made,	1
are	1
alone	1
contemplated.	1
From	1
this	1
circumstance,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
thing,	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
construed	1
to	1
extend	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
tribunals.	1
Either	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
or	1
the	1
local	1
courts	1
must	1
be	1
excluded	1
from	1
a	1
concurrent	1
jurisdiction	1
in	1
matters	1
of	1
national	1
concern,	1
else	1
the	1
judiciary	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
may	1
be	1
eluded	1
at	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
every	1
plaintiff	1
or	1
prosecutor.	1
Neither	1
of	1
these	1
consequences	1
ought,	1
without	1
evident	1
necessity,	1
to	1
be	1
involved;	1
the	1
latter	1
would	1
be	1
entirely	1
inadmissible,	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
defeat	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
and	1
avowed	1
purposes	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
government,	1
and	1
would	1
essentially	1
embarrass	1
its	1
measures.	1
Nor	1
do	1
I	1
perceive	1
any	1
foundation	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
supposition.	1
Agreeably	1
to	1
the	1
remark	1
already	1
made,	1
the	1
national	1
and	1
State	1
systems	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
ONE	1
WHOLE.	1
The	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
will	1
of	1
course	1
be	1
natural	1
auxiliaries	1
to	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
an	1
appeal	1
from	1
them	1
will	1
as	1
naturally	1
lie	1
to	1
that	1
tribunal	1
which	1
is	1
destined	1
to	1
unite	1
and	1
assimilate	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
national	1
justice	1
and	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
national	1
decisions.	1
The	1
evident	1
aim	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
is,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
causes	1
of	1
the	1
specified	1
classes	1
shall,	1
for	1
weighty	1
public	1
reasons,	1
receive	1
their	1
original	1
or	1
final	1
determination	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
To	1
confine,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
general	1
expressions	1
giving	1
appellate	1
jurisdiction	1
to	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court,	1
to	1
appeals	1
from	1
the	1
subordinate	1
federal	1
courts,	1
instead	1
of	1
allowing	1
their	1
extension	1
to	1
the	1
State	1
courts,	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
abridge	1
the	1
latitude	1
of	1
the	1
terms,	1
in	1
subversion	1
of	1
the	1
intent,	1
contrary	1
to	1
every	1
sound	1
rule	1
of	1
interpretation.	1
But	1
could	1
an	1
appeal	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
lie	1
from	1
the	1
State	1
courts	1
to	1
the	1
subordinate	1
federal	1
judicatories?	1
This	1
is	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
questions	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
raised,	1
and	1
of	1
greater	1
difficulty	1
than	1
the	1
former.	1
The	1
following	1
considerations	1
countenance	1
the	1
affirmative.	1
The	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
authorizes	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
"to	1
constitute	1
tribunals	1
inferior	1
to	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court."2	1
It	1
declares,	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
place,	1
that	1
"the	1
JUDICIAL	1
POWER	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
SHALL	1
BE	1
VESTED	1
in	1
one	1
Supreme	1
Court,	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
inferior	1
courts	1
as	1
Congress	1
shall	1
ordain	1
and	1
establish";	1
and	1
it	1
then	1
proceeds	1
to	1
enumerate	1
the	1
cases	1
to	1
which	1
this	1
judicial	1
power	1
shall	1
extend.	1
It	1
afterwards	1
divides	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
into	1
original	1
and	1
appellate,	1
but	1
gives	1
no	1
definition	1
of	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
subordinate	1
courts.	1
The	1
only	1
outlines	1
described	1
for	1
them,	1
are	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
"inferior	1
to	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court,"	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
shall	1
not	1
exceed	1
the	1
specified	1
limits	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
judiciary.	1
Whether	1
their	1
authority	1
shall	1
be	1
original	1
or	1
appellate,	1
or	1
both,	1
is	1
not	1
declared.	1
All	1
this	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
And	1
this	1
being	1
the	1
case,	1
I	1
perceive	1
at	1
present	1
no	1
impediment	1
to	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
an	1
appeal	1
from	1
the	1
State	1
courts	1
to	1
the	1
subordinate	1
national	1
tribunals;	1
and	1
many	1
advantages	1
attending	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
doing	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
imagined.	1
It	1
would	1
diminish	1
the	1
motives	1
to	1
the	1
multiplication	1
of	1
federal	1
courts,	1
and	1
would	1
admit	1
of	1
arrangements	1
calculated	1
to	1
contract	1
the	1
appellate	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court.	1
The	1
State	1
tribunals	1
may	1
then	1
be	1
left	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
entire	1
charge	1
of	1
federal	1
causes;	1
and	1
appeals,	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
deemed	1
proper,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court,	1
may	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
lie	1
from	1
the	1
State	1
courts	1
to	1
district	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
THE	1
objection	1
to	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
which	1
has	1
met	1
with	1
most	1
success	1
in	1
this	1
State,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
in	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
States,	1
is	1
THAT	1
RELATIVE	1
TO	1
THE	1
WANT	1
OF	1
A	1
CONSTITUTIONAL	1
PROVISION	1
for	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
civil	1
cases.	1
The	1
disingenuous	1
form	1
in	1
which	1
this	1
objection	1
is	1
usually	1
stated	1
has	1
been	1
repeatedly	1
adverted	1
to	1
and	1
exposed,	1
but	1
continues	1
to	1
be	1
pursued	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
conversations	1
and	1
writings	1
of	1
the	1
opponents	1
of	1
the	1
plan.	1
The	1
mere	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
CIVIL	1
CAUSES,	1
is	1
represented	1
as	1
an	1
abolition	1
of	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury,	1
and	1
the	1
declamations	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
afforded	1
a	1
pretext	1
are	1
artfully	1
calculated	1
to	1
induce	1
a	1
persuasion	1
that	1
this	1
pretended	1
abolition	1
is	1
complete	1
and	1
universal,	1
extending	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
every	1
species	1
of	1
civil,	1
but	1
even	1
to	1
CRIMINAL	1
CAUSES.	1
To	1
argue	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
latter	1
would,	1
however,	1
be	1
as	1
vain	1
and	1
fruitless	1
as	1
to	1
attempt	1
the	1
serious	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
EXISTENCE	1
of	1
MATTER,	1
or	1
to	1
demonstrate	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
propositions	1
which,	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
internal	1
evidence,	1
force	1
conviction,	1
when	1
expressed	1
in	1
language	1
adapted	1
to	1
convey	1
their	1
meaning.	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
civil	1
causes,	1
subtleties	1
almost	1
too	1
contemptible	1
for	1
refutation	1
have	1
been	1
employed	1
to	1
countenance	1
the	1
surmise	1
that	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
is	1
only	1
NOT	1
PROVIDED	1
FOR,	1
is	1
entirely	1
ABOLISHED.	1
Every	1
man	1
of	1
discernment	1
must	1
at	1
once	1
perceive	1
the	1
wide	1
difference	1
between	1
SILENCE	1
and	1
ABOLITION.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
inventors	1
of	1
this	1
fallacy	1
have	1
attempted	1
to	1
support	1
it	1
by	1
certain	1
LEGAL	1
MAXIMS	1
of	1
interpretation,	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
perverted	1
from	1
their	1
true	1
meaning,	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
wholly	1
useless	1
to	1
explore	1
the	1
ground	1
they	1
have	1
taken.	1
The	1
maxims	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
rely	1
are	1
of	1
this	1
nature:	1
"A	1
specification	1
of	1
particulars	1
is	1
an	1
exclusion	1
of	1
generals";	1
or,	1
"The	1
expression	1
of	1
one	1
thing	1
is	1
the	1
exclusion	1
of	1
another."	1
Hence,	1
say	1
they,	1
as	1
the	1
Constitution	1
has	1
established	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
criminal	1
cases,	1
and	1
is	1
silent	1
in	1
respect	1
to	1
civil,	1
this	1
silence	1
is	1
an	1
implied	1
prohibition	1
of	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
rules	1
of	1
legal	1
interpretation	1
are	1
rules	1
of	1
COMMONSENSE,	1
adopted	1
by	1
the	1
courts	1
in	1
the	1
construction	1
of	1
the	1
laws.	1
The	1
true	1
test,	1
therefore,	1
of	1
a	1
just	1
application	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
its	1
conformity	1
to	1
the	1
source	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
derived.	1
This	1
being	1
the	1
case,	1
let	1
me	1
ask	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
consistent	1
with	1
common-sense	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
a	1
provision	1
obliging	1
the	1
legislative	1
power	1
to	1
commit	1
the	1
trial	1
of	1
criminal	1
causes	1
to	1
juries,	1
is	1
a	1
privation	1
of	1
its	1
right	1
to	1
authorize	1
or	1
permit	1
that	1
mode	1
of	1
trial	1
in	1
other	1
cases?	1
Is	1
it	1
natural	1
to	1
suppose,	1
that	1
a	1
command	1
to	1
do	1
one	1
thing	1
is	1
a	1
prohibition	1
to	1
the	1
doing	1
of	1
another,	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
previous	1
power	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
incompatible	1
with	1
the	1
thing	1
commanded	1
to	1
be	1
done?	1
If	1
such	1
a	1
supposition	1
would	1
be	1
unnatural	1
and	1
unreasonable,	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
rational	1
to	1
maintain	1
that	1
an	1
injunction	1
of	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
certain	1
cases	1
is	1
an	1
interdiction	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
others.	1
A	1
power	1
to	1
constitute	1
courts	1
is	1
a	1
power	1
to	1
prescribe	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
trial;	1
and	1
consequently,	1
if	1
nothing	1
was	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
juries,	1
the	1
legislature	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
liberty	1
either	1
to	1
adopt	1
that	1
institution	1
or	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
alone.	1
This	1
discretion,	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
criminal	1
causes,	1
is	1
abridged	1
by	1
the	1
express	1
injunction	1
of	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
all	1
such	1
cases;	1
but	1
it	1
is,	1
of	1
course,	1
left	1
at	1
large	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
civil	1
causes,	1
there	1
being	1
a	1
total	1
silence	1
on	1
this	1
head.	1
The	1
specification	1
of	1
an	1
obligation	1
to	1
try	1
all	1
criminal	1
causes	1
in	1
a	1
particular	1
mode,	1
excludes	1
indeed	1
the	1
obligation	1
or	1
necessity	1
of	1
employing	1
the	1
same	1
mode	1
in	1
civil	1
causes,	1
but	1
does	1
not	1
abridge	1
THE	1
POWER	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
to	1
exercise	1
that	1
mode	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
thought	1
proper.	1
The	1
pretense,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
the	1
national	1
legislature	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
full	1
liberty	1
to	1
submit	1
all	1
the	1
civil	1
causes	1
of	1
federal	1
cognizance	1
to	1
the	1
determination	1
of	1
juries,	1
is	1
a	1
pretense	1
destitute	1
of	1
all	1
just	1
foundation.	1
From	1
these	1
observations	1
this	1
conclusion	1
results:	1
that	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
civil	1
cases	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
abolished;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
use	1
attempted	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
maxims	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
quoted,	1
is	1
contrary	1
to	1
reason	1
and	1
common-sense,	1
and	1
therefore	1
not	1
admissible.	1
Even	1
if	1
these	1
maxims	1
had	1
a	1
precise	1
technical	1
sense,	1
corresponding	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
employ	1
them	1
upon	1
the	1
present	1
occasion,	1
which,	1
however,	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
case,	1
they	1
would	1
still	1
be	1
inapplicable	1
to	1
a	1
constitution	1
of	1
government.	1
In	1
relation	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
subject,	1
the	1
natural	1
and	1
obvious	1
sense	1
of	1
its	1
provisions,	1
apart	1
from	1
any	1
technical	1
rules,	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
criterion	1
of	1
construction.	1
Having	1
now	1
seen	1
that	1
the	1
maxims	1
relied	1
upon	1
will	1
not	1
bear	1
the	1
use	1
made	1
of	1
them,	1
let	1
us	1
endeavor	1
to	1
ascertain	1
their	1
proper	1
use	1
and	1
true	1
meaning.	1
This	1
will	1
be	1
best	1
done	1
by	1
examples.	1
The	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
declares	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
Congress,	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
of	1
the	1
NATIONAL	1
LEGISLATURE,	1
shall	1
extend	1
to	1
certain	1
enumerated	1
cases.	1
This	1
specification	1
of	1
particulars	1
evidently	1
excludes	1
all	1
pretension	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
legislative	1
authority,	1
because	1
an	1
affirmative	1
grant	1
of	1
special	1
powers	1
would	1
be	1
absurd,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
useless,	1
if	1
a	1
general	1
authority	1
was	1
intended.	1
In	1
like	1
manner	1
the	1
judicial	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
judicatures	1
is	1
declared	1
by	1
the	1
Constitution	1
to	1
comprehend	1
certain	1
cases	1
particularly	1
specified.	1
The	1
expression	1
of	1
those	1
cases	1
marks	1
the	1
precise	1
limits,	1
beyond	1
which	1
the	1
federal	1
courts	1
cannot	1
extend	1
their	1
jurisdiction,	1
because	1
the	1
objects	1
of	1
their	1
cognizance	1
being	1
enumerated,	1
the	1
specification	1
would	1
be	1
nugatory	1
if	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
exclude	1
all	1
ideas	1
of	1
more	1
extensive	1
authority.	1
These	1
examples	1
are	1
sufficient	1
to	1
elucidate	1
the	1
maxims	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
to	1
designate	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
used.	1
But	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
no	1
misapprehensions	1
upon	1
this	1
subject,	1
I	1
shall	1
add	1
one	1
case	1
more,	1
to	1
demonstrate	1
the	1
proper	1
use	1
of	1
these	1
maxims,	1
and	1
the	1
abuse	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
of	1
them.	1
Let	1
us	1
suppose	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
this	1
State	1
a	1
married	1
woman	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
conveying	1
her	1
estate,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
legislature,	1
considering	1
this	1
as	1
an	1
evil,	1
should	1
enact	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
dispose	1
of	1
her	1
property	1
by	1
deed	1
executed	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
a	1
magistrate.	1
In	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
but	1
the	1
specification	1
would	1
amount	1
to	1
an	1
exclusion	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
mode	1
of	1
conveyance,	1
because	1
the	1
woman	1
having	1
no	1
previous	1
power	1
to	1
alienate	1
her	1
property,	1
the	1
specification	1
determines	1
the	1
particular	1
mode	1
which	1
she	1
is,	1
for	1
that	1
purpose,	1
to	1
avail	1
herself	1
of.	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
further	1
suppose	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
subsequent	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
act	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
declared	1
that	1
no	1
woman	1
should	1
dispose	1
of	1
any	1
estate	1
of	1
a	1
determinate	1
value	1
without	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
three	1
of	1
her	1
nearest	1
relations,	1
signified	1
by	1
their	1
signing	1
the	1
deed;	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
inferred	1
from	1
this	1
regulation	1
that	1
a	1
married	1
woman	1
might	1
not	1
procure	1
the	1
approbation	1
of	1
her	1
relations	1
to	1
a	1
deed	1
for	1
conveying	1
property	1
of	1
inferior	1
value?	1
The	1
position	1
is	1
too	1
absurd	1
to	1
merit	1
a	1
refutation,	1
and	1
yet	1
this	1
is	1
precisely	1
the	1
position	1
which	1
those	1
must	1
establish	1
who	1
contend	1
that	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
juries	1
in	1
civil	1
cases	1
is	1
abolished,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
expressly	1
provided	1
for	1
in	1
cases	1
of	1
a	1
criminal	1
nature.	1
From	1
these	1
observations	1
it	1
must	1
appear	1
unquestionably	1
true,	1
that	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
is	1
in	1
no	1
case	1
abolished	1
by	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
equally	1
true,	1
that	1
in	1
those	1
controversies	1
between	1
individuals	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
interested,	1
that	1
institution	1
will	1
remain	1
precisely	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
situation	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
placed	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
no	1
degree	1
altered	1
or	1
influenced	1
by	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
under	1
consideration.	1
The	1
foundation	1
of	1
this	1
assertion	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
national	1
judiciary	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
cognizance	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
they	1
will	1
remain	1
determinable	1
as	1
heretofore	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
courts	1
only,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
which	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
and	1
laws	1
prescribe.	1
All	1
land	1
causes,	1
except	1
where	1
claims	1
under	1
the	1
grants	1
of	1
different	1
States	1
come	1
into	1
question,	1
and	1
all	1
other	1
controversies	1
between	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
State,	1
unless	1
where	1
they	1
depend	1
upon	1
positive	1
violations	1
of	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
union,	1
by	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
will	1
belong	1
exclusively	1
to	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
tribunals.	1
Add	1
to	1
this,	1
that	1
admiralty	1
causes,	1
and	1
almost	1
all	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
of	1
equity	1
jurisdiction,	1
are	1
determinable	1
under	1
our	1
own	1
government	1
without	1
the	1
intervention	1
of	1
a	1
jury,	1
and	1
the	1
inference	1
from	1
the	1
whole	1
will	1
be,	1
that	1
this	1
institution,	1
as	1
it	1
exists	1
with	1
us	1
at	1
present,	1
cannot	1
possibly	1
be	1
affected	1
to	1
any	1
great	1
extent	1
by	1
the	1
proposed	1
alteration	1
in	1
our	1
system	1
of	1
government.	1
The	1
friends	1
and	1
adversaries	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
if	1
they	1
agree	1
in	1
nothing	1
else,	1
concur	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
value	1
they	1
set	1
upon	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury;	1
or	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
difference	1
between	1
them	1
it	1
consists	1
in	1
this:	1
the	1
former	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
valuable	1
safeguard	1
to	1
liberty;	1
the	1
latter	1
represent	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
very	1
palladium	1
of	1
free	1
government.	1
For	1
my	1
own	1
part,	1
the	1
more	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
the	1
institution	1
has	1
fallen	1
under	1
my	1
observation,	1
the	1
more	1
reason	1
I	1
have	1
discovered	1
for	1
holding	1
it	1
in	1
high	1
estimation;	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
altogether	1
superfluous	1
to	1
examine	1
to	1
what	1
extent	1
it	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
esteemed	1
useful	1
or	1
essential	1
in	1
a	1
representative	1
republic,	1
or	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
merit	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
entitled	1
to,	1
as	1
a	1
defense	1
against	1
the	1
oppressions	1
of	1
an	1
hereditary	1
monarch,	1
than	1
as	1
a	1
barrier	1
to	1
the	1
tyranny	1
of	1
popular	1
magistrates	1
in	1
a	1
popular	1
government.	1
Discussions	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
curious	1
than	1
beneficial,	1
as	1
all	1
are	1
satisfied	1
of	1
the	1
utility	1
of	1
the	1
institution,	1
and	1
of	1
its	1
friendly	1
aspect	1
to	1
liberty.	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
readily	1
discern	1
the	1
inseparable	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
existence	1
of	1
liberty,	1
and	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
civil	1
cases.	1
Arbitrary	1
impeachments,	1
arbitrary	1
methods	1
of	1
prosecuting	1
pretended	1
offenses,	1
and	1
arbitrary	1
punishments	1
upon	1
arbitrary	1
convictions,	1
have	1
ever	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
great	1
engines	1
of	1
judicial	1
despotism;	1
and	1
these	1
have	1
all	1
relation	1
to	1
criminal	1
proceedings.	1
The	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
criminal	1
cases,	1
aided	1
by	1
the	1
habeas-corpus	1
act,	1
seems	1
therefore	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
question.	1
And	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
are	1
provided	1
for,	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
ample	1
manner,	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
observed,	1
that	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
is	1
a	1
safeguard	1
against	1
an	1
oppressive	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
taxation.	1
This	1
observation	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
canvassed.	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
influence	1
upon	1
the	1
legislature,	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
AMOUNT	1
of	1
taxes	1
to	1
be	1
laid,	1
to	1
the	1
OBJECTS	1
upon	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
imposed,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
RULE	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
apportioned.	1
If	1
it	1
can	1
have	1
any	1
influence,	1
therefore,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
collection,	1
and	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
intrusted	1
with	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
revenue	1
laws.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
collection	1
in	1
this	1
State,	1
under	1
our	1
own	1
Constitution,	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
is	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
out	1
of	1
use.	1
The	1
taxes	1
are	1
usually	1
levied	1
by	1
the	1
more	1
summary	1
proceeding	1
of	1
distress	1
and	1
sale,	1
as	1
in	1
cases	1
of	1
rent.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
acknowledged	1
on	1
all	1
hands,	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
the	1
revenue	1
laws.	1
The	1
dilatory	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
trial	1
at	1
law	1
to	1
recover	1
the	1
taxes	1
imposed	1
on	1
individuals,	1
would	1
neither	1
suit	1
the	1
exigencies	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
nor	1
promote	1
the	1
convenience	1
of	1
the	1
citizens.	1
It	1
would	1
often	1
occasion	1
an	1
accumulation	1
of	1
costs,	1
more	1
burdensome	1
than	1
the	1
original	1
sum	1
of	1
the	1
tax	1
to	1
be	1
levied.	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
revenue,	1
the	1
provision	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
criminal	1
cases,	1
will	1
afford	1
the	1
security	1
aimed	1
at.	1
Wilful	1
abuses	1
of	1
a	1
public	1
authority,	1
to	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
subject,	1
and	1
every	1
species	1
of	1
official	1
extortion,	1
are	1
offenses	1
against	1
the	1
government,	1
for	1
which	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
commit	1
them	1
may	1
be	1
indicted	1
and	1
punished	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
case.	1
The	1
excellence	1
of	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
civil	1
cases	1
appears	1
to	1
depend	1
on	1
circumstances	1
foreign	1
to	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
liberty.	1
The	1
strongest	1
argument	1
in	1
its	1
favor	1
is,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
security	1
against	1
corruption.	1
As	1
there	1
is	1
always	1
more	1
time	1
and	1
better	1
opportunity	1
to	1
tamper	1
with	1
a	1
standing	1
body	1
of	1
magistrates	1
than	1
with	1
a	1
jury	1
summoned	1
for	1
the	1
occasion,	1
there	1
is	1
room	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
a	1
corrupt	1
influence	1
would	1
more	1
easily	1
find	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
latter.	1
The	1
force	1
of	1
this	1
consideration	1
is,	1
however,	1
diminished	1
by	1
others.	1
The	1
sheriff,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
summoner	1
of	1
ordinary	1
juries,	1
and	1
the	1
clerks	1
of	1
courts,	1
who	1
have	1
the	1
nomination	1
of	1
special	1
juries,	1
are	1
themselves	1
standing	1
officers,	1
and,	1
acting	1
individually,	1
may	1
be	1
supposed	1
more	1
accessible	1
to	1
the	1
touch	1
of	1
corruption	1
than	1
the	1
judges,	1
who	1
are	1
a	1
collective	1
body.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
difficult	1
to	1
see,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
those	1
officers	1
to	1
select	1
jurors	1
who	1
would	1
serve	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
corrupted	1
bench.	1
In	1
the	1
next	1
place,	1
it	1
may	1
fairly	1
be	1
supposed,	1
that	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
less	1
difficulty	1
in	1
gaining	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
jurors	1
promiscuously	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
public	1
mass,	1
than	1
in	1
gaining	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
chosen	1
by	1
the	1
government	1
for	1
their	1
probity	1
and	1
good	1
character.	1
But	1
making	1
every	1
deduction	1
for	1
these	1
considerations,	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
must	1
still	1
be	1
a	1
valuable	1
check	1
upon	1
corruption.	1
It	1
greatly	1
multiplies	1
the	1
impediments	1
to	1
its	1
success.	1
As	1
matters	1
now	1
stand,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
corrupt	1
both	1
court	1
and	1
jury;	1
for	1
where	1
the	1
jury	1
have	1
gone	1
evidently	1
wrong,	1
the	1
court	1
will	1
generally	1
grant	1
a	1
new	1
trial,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
of	1
little	1
use	1
to	1
practice	1
upon	1
the	1
jury,	1
unless	1
the	1
court	1
could	1
be	1
likewise	1
gained.	1
Here	1
then	1
is	1
a	1
double	1
security;	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
readily	1
be	1
perceived	1
that	1
this	1
complicated	1
agency	1
tends	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
purity	1
of	1
both	1
institutions.	1
By	1
increasing	1
the	1
obstacles	1
to	1
success,	1
it	1
discourages	1
attempts	1
to	1
seduce	1
the	1
integrity	1
of	1
either.	1
The	1
temptations	1
to	1
prostitution	1
which	1
the	1
judges	1
might	1
have	1
to	1
surmount,	1
must	1
certainly	1
be	1
much	1
fewer,	1
while	1
the	1
co-operation	1
of	1
a	1
jury	1
is	1
necessary,	1
than	1
they	1
might	1
be,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
themselves	1
the	1
exclusive	1
determination	1
of	1
all	1
causes.	1
Notwithstanding,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
doubts	1
I	1
have	1
expressed,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
essentiality	1
of	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
civil	1
cases	1
to	1
liberty,	1
I	1
admit	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
most	1
cases,	1
under	1
proper	1
regulations,	1
an	1
excellent	1
method	1
of	1
determining	1
questions	1
of	1
property;	1
and	1
that	1
on	1
this	1
account	1
alone	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
entitled	1
to	1
a	1
constitutional	1
provision	1
in	1
its	1
favor	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
to	1
fix	1
the	1
limits	1
within	1
which	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
comprehended.	1
There	1
is,	1
however,	1
in	1
all	1
cases,	1
great	1
difficulty	1
in	1
this;	1
and	1
men	1
not	1
blinded	1
by	1
enthusiasm	1
must	1
be	1
sensible	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
federal	1
government,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
composition	1
of	1
societies	1
whose	1
ideas	1
and	1
institutions	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
matter	1
materially	1
vary	1
from	1
each	1
other,	1
that	1
difficulty	1
must	1
be	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
augmented.	1
For	1
my	1
own	1
part,	1
at	1
every	1
new	1
view	1
I	1
take	1
of	1
the	1
subject,	1
I	1
become	1
more	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
reality	1
of	1
the	1
obstacles	1
which,	1
we	1
are	1
authoritatively	1
informed,	1
prevented	1
the	1
insertion	1
of	1
a	1
provision	1
on	1
this	1
head	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention.	1
The	1
great	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
the	1
jury	1
trial	1
in	1
different	1
States	1
is	1
not	1
generally	1
understood;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
considerable	1
influence	1
on	1
the	1
sentence	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
pass	1
upon	1
the	1
omission	1
complained	1
of	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
point,	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
necessary.	1
In	1
this	1
State,	1
our	1
judicial	1
establishments	1
resemble,	1
more	1
nearly	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other,	1
those	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain.	1
We	1
have	1
courts	1
of	1
common	1
law,	1
courts	1
of	1
probates	1
(analogous	1
in	1
certain	1
matters	1
to	1
the	1
spiritual	1
courts	1
in	1
England),	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
admiralty	1
and	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
chancery.	1
In	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
common	1
law	1
only,	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
prevails,	1
and	1
this	1
with	1
some	1
exceptions.	1
In	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
a	1
single	1
judge	1
presides,	1
and	1
proceeds	1
in	1
general	1
either	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
canon	1
or	1
civil	1
law,	1
without	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
a	1
jury.1	1
In	1
New	1
Jersey,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
chancery	1
which	1
proceeds	1
like	1
ours,	1
but	1
neither	1
courts	1
of	1
admiralty	1
nor	1
of	1
probates,	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
in	1
which	1
these	1
last	1
are	1
established	1
with	1
us.	1
In	1
that	1
State	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
common	1
law	1
have	1
the	1
cognizance	1
of	1
those	1
causes	1
which	1
with	1
us	1
are	1
determinable	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
admiralty	1
and	1
of	1
probates,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
the	1
jury	1
trial	1
is	1
more	1
extensive	1
in	1
New	1
Jersey	1
than	1
in	1
New	1
York.	1
In	1
Pennsylvania,	1
this	1
is	1
perhaps	1
still	1
more	1
the	1
case,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
court	1
of	1
chancery	1
in	1
that	1
State,	1
and	1
its	1
common-law	1
courts	1
have	1
equity	1
jurisdiction.	1
It	1
has	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
admiralty,	1
but	1
none	1
of	1
probates,	1
at	1
least	1
on	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
ours.	1
Delaware	1
has	1
in	1
these	1
respects	1
imitated	1
Pennsylvania.	1
Maryland	1
approaches	1
more	1
nearly	1
to	1
New	1
York,	1
as	1
does	1
also	1
Virginia,	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
latter	1
has	1
a	1
plurality	1
of	1
chancellors.	1
North	1
Carolina	1
bears	1
most	1
affinity	1
to	1
Pennsylvania;	1
South	1
Carolina	1
to	1
Virginia.	1
I	1
believe,	1
however,	1
that	1
in	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
States	1
which	1
have	1
distinct	1
courts	1
of	1
admiralty,	1
the	1
causes	1
depending	1
in	1
them	1
are	1
triable	1
by	1
juries.	1
In	1
Georgia	1
there	1
are	1
none	1
but	1
common-law	1
courts,	1
and	1
an	1
appeal	1
of	1
course	1
lies	1
from	1
the	1
verdict	1
of	1
one	1
jury	1
to	1
another,	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
a	1
special	1
jury,	1
and	1
for	1
which	1
a	1
particular	1
mode	1
of	1
appointment	1
is	1
marked	1
out.	1
In	1
Connecticut,	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
distinct	1
courts	1
either	1
of	1
chancery	1
or	1
of	1
admiralty,	1
and	1
their	1
courts	1
of	1
probates	1
have	1
no	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
causes.	1
Their	1
common-law	1
courts	1
have	1
admiralty	1
and,	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
extent,	1
equity	1
jurisdiction.	1
In	1
cases	1
of	1
importance,	1
their	1
General	1
Assembly	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
court	1
of	1
chancery.	1
In	1
Connecticut,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
extends	1
in	1
PRACTICE	1
further	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
State	1
yet	1
mentioned.	1
Rhode	1
Island	1
is,	1
I	1
believe,	1
in	1
this	1
particular,	1
pretty	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
Connecticut.	1
Massachusetts	1
and	1
New	1
Hampshire,	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
blending	1
of	1
law,	1
equity,	1
and	1
admiralty	1
jurisdictions,	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
predicament.	1
In	1
the	1
four	1
Eastern	1
States,	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
not	1
only	1
stands	1
upon	1
a	1
broader	1
foundation	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
States,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
attended	1
with	1
a	1
peculiarity	1
unknown,	1
in	1
its	1
full	1
extent,	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
them.	1
There	1
is	1
an	1
appeal	1
OF	1
COURSE	1
from	1
one	1
jury	1
to	1
another,	1
till	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
two	1
verdicts	1
out	1
of	1
three	1
on	1
one	1
side.	1
From	1
this	1
sketch	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
material	1
diversity,	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
modification	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
the	1
institution	1
of	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
civil	1
cases,	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
States;	1
and	1
from	1
this	1
fact	1
these	1
obvious	1
reflections	1
flow:	1
first,	1
that	1
no	1
general	1
rule	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
fixed	1
upon	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
corresponded	1
with	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
States;	1
and	1
secondly,	1
that	1
more	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
much	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
hazarded	1
by	1
taking	1
the	1
system	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
State	1
for	1
a	1
standard,	1
as	1
by	1
omitting	1
a	1
provision	1
altogether	1
and	1
leaving	1
the	1
matter,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
done,	1
to	1
legislative	1
regulation.	1
The	1
propositions	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
for	1
supplying	1
the	1
omission	1
have	1
rather	1
served	1
to	1
illustrate	1
than	1
to	1
obviate	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
the	1
thing.	1
The	1
minority	1
of	1
Pennsylvania	1
have	1
proposed	1
this	1
mode	1
of	1
expression	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
"Trial	1
by	1
jury	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
heretofore"	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
maintain	1
would	1
be	1
senseless	1
and	1
nugatory.	1
The	1
United	1
States,	1
in	1
their	1
united	1
or	1
collective	1
capacity,	1
are	1
the	1
OBJECT	1
to	1
which	1
all	1
general	1
provisions	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
construed	1
to	1
refer.	1
Now	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
though	1
trial	1
by	1
jury,	1
with	1
various	1
limitations,	1
is	1
known	1
in	1
each	1
State	1
individually,	1
yet	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
AS	1
SUCH,	1
it	1
is	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
altogether	1
unknown,	1
because	1
the	1
present	1
federal	1
government	1
has	1
no	1
judiciary	1
power	1
whatever;	1
and	1
consequently	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
proper	1
antecedent	1
or	1
previous	1
establishment	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
term	1
HERETOFORE	1
could	1
relate.	1
It	1
would	1
therefore	1
be	1
destitute	1
of	1
a	1
precise	1
meaning,	1
and	1
inoperative	1
from	1
its	1
uncertainty.	1
As,	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand,	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
the	1
provision	1
would	1
not	1
fulfil	1
the	1
intent	1
of	1
its	1
proposers,	1
so,	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
if	1
I	1
apprehend	1
that	1
intent	1
rightly,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
itself	1
inexpedient.	1
I	1
presume	1
it	1
to	1
be,	1
that	1
causes	1
in	1
the	1
federal	1
courts	1
should	1
be	1
tried	1
by	1
jury,	1
if,	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
where	1
the	1
courts	1
sat,	1
that	1
mode	1
of	1
trial	1
would	1
obtain	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
case	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
courts;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
admiralty	1
causes	1
should	1
be	1
tried	1
in	1
Connecticut	1
by	1
a	1
jury,	1
in	1
New	1
York	1
without	1
one.	1
The	1
capricious	1
operation	1
of	1
so	1
dissimilar	1
a	1
method	1
of	1
trial	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
cases,	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
government,	1
is	1
of	1
itself	1
sufficient	1
to	1
indispose	1
every	1
wellregulated	1
judgment	1
towards	1
it.	1
Whether	1
the	1
cause	1
should	1
be	1
tried	1
with	1
or	1
without	1
a	1
jury,	1
would	1
depend,	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
cases,	1
on	1
the	1
accidental	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
and	1
parties.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not,	1
in	1
my	1
estimation,	1
the	1
greatest	1
objection.	1
I	1
feel	1
a	1
deep	1
and	1
deliberate	1
conviction	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
cases	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
is	1
an	1
ineligible	1
one.	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
so	1
particularly	1
in	1
cases	1
which	1
concern	1
the	1
public	1
peace	1
with	1
foreign	1
nations	1
that	1
is,	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
where	1
the	1
question	1
turns	1
wholly	1
on	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
nations.	1
Of	1
this	1
nature,	1
among	1
others,	1
are	1
all	1
prize	1
causes.	1
Juries	1
cannot	1
be	1
supposed	1
competent	1
to	1
investigations	1
that	1
require	1
a	1
thorough	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
and	1
usages	1
of	1
nations;	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
sometimes	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
impressions	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
them	1
to	1
pay	1
sufficient	1
regard	1
to	1
those	1
considerations	1
of	1
public	1
policy	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
guide	1
their	1
inquiries.	1
There	1
would	1
of	1
course	1
be	1
always	1
danger	1
that	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
other	1
nations	1
might	1
be	1
infringed	1
by	1
their	1
decisions,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
afford	1
occasions	1
of	1
reprisal	1
and	1
war.	1
Though	1
the	1
proper	1
province	1
of	1
juries	1
be	1
to	1
determine	1
matters	1
of	1
fact,	1
yet	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
legal	1
consequences	1
are	1
complicated	1
with	1
fact	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
a	1
separation	1
impracticable.	1
It	1
will	1
add	1
great	1
weight	1
to	1
this	1
remark,	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
prize	1
causes,	1
to	1
mention	1
that	1
the	1
method	1
of	1
determining	1
them	1
has	1
been	1
thought	1
worthy	1
of	1
particular	1
regulation	1
in	1
various	1
treaties	1
between	1
different	1
powers	1
of	1
Europe,	1
and	1
that,	1
pursuant	1
to	1
such	1
treaties,	1
they	1
are	1
determinable	1
in	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
resort,	1
before	1
the	1
king	1
himself,	1
in	1
his	1
privy	1
council,	1
where	1
the	1
fact,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
law,	1
undergoes	1
a	1
re-examination.	1
This	1
alone	1
demonstrates	1
the	1
impolicy	1
of	1
inserting	1
a	1
fundamental	1
provision	1
in	1
the	1
Constitution	1
which	1
would	1
make	1
the	1
State	1
systems	1
a	1
standard	1
for	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
in	1
the	1
article	1
under	1
consideration,	1
and	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
encumbering	1
the	1
government	1
with	1
any	1
constitutional	1
provisions	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
indisputable.	1
My	1
convictions	1
are	1
equally	1
strong	1
that	1
great	1
advantages	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
separation	1
of	1
the	1
equity	1
from	1
the	1
law	1
jurisdiction,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
causes	1
which	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
would	1
be	1
improperly	1
committed	1
to	1
juries.	1
The	1
great	1
and	1
primary	1
use	1
of	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
equity	1
is	1
to	1
give	1
relief	1
IN	1
EXTRAORDINARY	1
CASES,	1
which	1
are	1
EXCEPTIONS2	1
to	1
general	1
rules.	1
To	1
unite	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
such	1
cases	1
with	1
the	1
ordinary	1
jurisdiction,	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
unsettle	1
the	1
general	1
rules,	1
and	1
to	1
subject	1
every	1
case	1
that	1
arises	1
to	1
a	1
SPECIAL	1
determination;	1
while	1
a	1
separation	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
has	1
the	1
contrary	1
effect	1
of	1
rendering	1
one	1
a	1
sentinel	1
over	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
of	1
keeping	1
each	1
within	1
the	1
expedient	1
limits.	1
Besides	1
this,	1
the	1
circumstances	1
that	1
constitute	1
cases	1
proper	1
for	1
courts	1
of	1
equity	1
are	1
in	1
many	1
instances	1
so	1
nice	1
and	1
intricate,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
incompatible	1
with	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
trials	1
by	1
jury.	1
They	1
require	1
often	1
such	1
long,	1
deliberate,	1
and	1
critical	1
investigation	1
as	1
would	1
be	1
impracticable	1
to	1
men	1
called	1
from	1
their	1
occupations,	1
and	1
obliged	1
to	1
decide	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
permitted	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
them.	1
The	1
simplicity	1
and	1
expedition	1
which	1
form	1
the	1
distinguishing	1
characters	1
of	1
this	1
mode	1
of	1
trial	1
require	1
that	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
be	1
decided	1
should	1
be	1
reduced	1
to	1
some	1
single	1
and	1
obvious	1
point;	1
while	1
the	1
litigations	1
usual	1
in	1
chancery	1
frequently	1
comprehend	1
a	1
long	1
train	1
of	1
minute	1
and	1
independent	1
particulars.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
separation	1
of	1
the	1
equity	1
from	1
the	1
legal	1
jurisdiction	1
is	1
peculiar	1
to	1
the	1
English	1
system	1
of	1
jurisprudence:	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
model	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
followed	1
in	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
equally	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
has	1
been	1
unknown	1
in	1
every	1
case	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
united.	1
And	1
the	1
separation	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
that	1
institution	1
in	1
its	1
pristine	1
purity.	1
The	1
nature	1
of	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
equity	1
will	1
readily	1
permit	1
the	1
extension	1
of	1
its	1
jurisdiction	1
to	1
matters	1
of	1
law;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
be	1
suspected,	1
that	1
the	1
attempt	1
to	1
extend	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
law	1
to	1
matters	1
of	1
equity	1
will	1
not	1
only	1
be	1
unproductive	1
of	1
the	1
advantages	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
courts	1
of	1
chancery,	1
on	1
the	1
plan	1
upon	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
established	1
in	1
this	1
State,	1
but	1
will	1
tend	1
gradually	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
law,	1
and	1
to	1
undermine	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury,	1
by	1
introducing	1
questions	1
too	1
complicated	1
for	1
a	1
decision	1
in	1
that	1
mode.	1
These	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
conclusive	1
reasons	1
against	1
incorporating	1
the	1
systems	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
States,	1
in	1
the	1
formation	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
judiciary,	1
according	1
to	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
conjectured	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
attempt	1
of	1
the	1
Pennsylvania	1
minority.	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
examine	1
how	1
far	1
the	1
proposition	1
of	1
Massachusetts	1
is	1
calculated	1
to	1
remedy	1
the	1
supposed	1
defect.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
form:	1
"In	1
civil	1
actions	1
between	1
citizens	1
of	1
different	1
States,	1
every	1
issue	1
of	1
fact,	1
arising	1
in	1
ACTIONS	1
AT	1
COMMON	1
LAW,	1
may	1
be	1
tried	1
by	1
a	1
jury	1
if	1
the	1
parties,	1
or	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
request	1
it."	1
This,	1
at	1
best,	1
is	1
a	1
proposition	1
confined	1
to	1
one	1
description	1
of	1
causes;	1
and	1
the	1
inference	1
is	1
fair,	1
either	1
that	1
the	1
Massachusetts	1
convention	1
considered	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
class	1
of	1
federal	1
causes,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
would	1
be	1
proper;	1
or	1
that	1
if	1
desirous	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
extensive	1
provision,	1
they	1
found	1
it	1
impracticable	1
to	1
devise	1
one	1
which	1
would	1
properly	1
answer	1
the	1
end.	1
If	1
the	1
first,	1
the	1
omission	1
of	1
a	1
regulation	1
respecting	1
so	1
partial	1
an	1
object	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
a	1
material	1
imperfection	1
in	1
the	1
system.	1
If	1
the	1
last,	1
it	1
affords	1
a	1
strong	1
corroboration	1
of	1
the	1
extreme	1
difficulty	1
of	1
the	1
thing.	1
But	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
all:	1
if	1
we	1
advert	1
to	1
the	1
observations	1
already	1
made	1
respecting	1
the	1
courts	1
that	1
subsist	1
in	1
the	1
several	1
States	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
the	1
different	1
powers	1
exercised	1
by	1
them,	1
it	1
will	1
appear	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
expressions	1
more	1
vague	1
and	1
indeterminate	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
employed	1
to	1
characterize	1
THAT	1
species	1
of	1
causes	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
intended	1
shall	1
be	1
entitled	1
to	1
a	1
trial	1
by	1
jury.	1
In	1
this	1
State,	1
the	1
boundaries	1
between	1
actions	1
at	1
common	1
law	1
and	1
actions	1
of	1
equitable	1
jurisdiction,	1
are	1
ascertained	1
in	1
conformity	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
which	1
prevail	1
in	1
England	1
upon	1
that	1
subject.	1
In	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
States	1
the	1
boundaries	1
are	1
less	1
precise.	1
In	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
every	1
cause	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
tried	1
in	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
common	1
law,	1
and	1
upon	1
that	1
foundation	1
every	1
action	1
may	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
an	1
action	1
at	1
common	1
law,	1
to	1
be	1
determined	1
by	1
a	1
jury,	1
if	1
the	1
parties,	1
or	1
either	1
of	1
them,	1
choose	1
it.	1
Hence	1
the	1
same	1
irregularity	1
and	1
confusion	1
would	1
be	1
introduced	1
by	1
a	1
compliance	1
with	1
this	1
proposition,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
noticed	1
as	1
resulting	1
from	1
the	1
regulation	1
proposed	1
by	1
the	1
Pennsylvania	1
minority.	1
In	1
one	1
State	1
a	1
cause	1
would	1
receive	1
its	1
determination	1
from	1
a	1
jury,	1
if	1
the	1
parties,	1
or	1
either	1
of	1
them,	1
requested	1
it;	1
but	1
in	1
another	1
State,	1
a	1
cause	1
exactly	1
similar	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
must	1
be	1
decided	1
without	1
the	1
intervention	1
of	1
a	1
jury,	1
because	1
the	1
State	1
judicatories	1
varied	1
as	1
to	1
common-law	1
jurisdiction.	1
It	1
is	1
obvious,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
the	1
Massachusetts	1
proposition,	1
upon	1
this	1
subject	1
cannot	1
operate	1
as	1
a	1
general	1
regulation,	1
until	1
some	1
uniform	1
plan,	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
common-law	1
and	1
equitable	1
jurisdictions,	1
shall	1
be	1
adopted	1
by	1
the	1
different	1
States.	1
To	1
devise	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
is	1
a	1
task	1
arduous	1
in	1
itself,	1
and	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
require	1
much	1
time	1
and	1
reflection	1
to	1
mature.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
extremely	1
difficult,	1
if	1
not	1
impossible,	1
to	1
suggest	1
any	1
general	1
regulation	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
acceptable	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
States	1
in	1
the	1
Union,	1
or	1
that	1
would	1
perfectly	1
quadrate	1
with	1
the	1
several	1
State	1
institutions.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
asked,	1
Why	1
could	1
not	1
a	1
reference	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
this	1
State,	1
taking	1
that,	1
which	1
is	1
allowed	1
by	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
one,	1
as	1
a	1
standard	1
for	1
the	1
United	1
States?	1
I	1
answer	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
probable	1
the	1
other	1
States	1
would	1
entertain	1
the	1
same	1
opinion	1
of	1
our	1
institutions	1
as	1
we	1
do	1
ourselves.	1
It	1
is	1
natural	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
hitherto	1
more	1
attached	1
to	1
their	1
own,	1
and	1
that	1
each	1
would	1
struggle	1
for	1
the	1
preference.	1
If	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
taking	1
one	1
State	1
as	1
a	1
model	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
had	1
been	1
thought	1
of	1
in	1
the	1
convention,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
presumed	1
that	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
that	1
body	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
rendered	1
difficult	1
by	1
the	1
predilection	1
of	1
each	1
representation	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
government;	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
uncertain	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
as	1
the	1
model.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
shown	1
that	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
be	1
improper	1
ones.	1
And	1
I	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
conjecture,	1
whether,	1
under	1
all	1
circumstances,	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
likely	1
that	1
New	1
York,	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
State,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
preferred.	1
But	1
admit	1
that	1
a	1
judicious	1
selection	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
effected	1
in	1
the	1
convention,	1
still	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
great	1
danger	1
of	1
jealousy	1
and	1
disgust	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
States,	1
at	1
the	1
partiality	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
shown	1
to	1
the	1
institutions	1
of	1
one.	1
The	1
enemies	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
furnished	1
with	1
a	1
fine	1
pretext	1
for	1
raising	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
local	1
prejudices	1
against	1
it,	1
which	1
perhaps	1
might	1
have	1
hazarded,	1
in	1
no	1
inconsiderable	1
degree,	1
its	1
final	1
establishment.	1
To	1
avoid	1
the	1
embarrassments	1
of	1
a	1
definition	1
of	1
the	1
cases	1
which	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
ought	1
to	1
embrace,	1
it	1
is	1
sometimes	1
suggested	1
by	1
men	1
of	1
enthusiastic	1
tempers,	1
that	1
a	1
provision	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
inserted	1
for	1
establishing	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
cases	1
whatsoever.	1
For	1
this	1
I	1
believe,	1
no	1
precedent	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
any	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
Union;	1
and	1
the	1
considerations	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
stated	1
in	1
discussing	1
the	1
proposition	1
of	1
the	1
minority	1
of	1
Pennsylvania,	1
must	1
satisfy	1
every	1
sober	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
ALL	1
cases	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
unpardonable	1
error	1
in	1
the	1
plan.	1
In	1
short,	1
the	1
more	1
it	1
is	1
considered	1
the	1
more	1
arduous	1
will	1
appear	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
fashioning	1
a	1
provision	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
form	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
express	1
too	1
little	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
purpose,	1
or	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
advisable;	1
or	1
which	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
opened	1
other	1
sources	1
of	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
essential	1
object	1
of	1
introducing	1
a	1
firm	1
national	1
government.	1
I	1
cannot	1
but	1
persuade	1
myself,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
that	1
the	1
different	1
lights	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
subject	1
has	1
been	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
observations,	1
will	1
go	1
far	1
towards	1
removing	1
in	1
candid	1
minds	1
the	1
apprehensions	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
entertained	1
on	1
the	1
point.	1
They	1
have	1
tended	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
liberty	1
is	1
materially	1
concerned	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
criminal	1
cases,	1
which	1
is	1
provided	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
ample	1
manner	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention;	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
far	1
the	1
greatest	1
proportion	1
of	1
civil	1
cases,	1
and	1
those	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
great	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
is	1
interested,	1
that	1
mode	1
of	1
trial	1
will	1
remain	1
in	1
its	1
full	1
force,	1
as	1
established	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
untouched	1
and	1
unaffected	1
by	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention;	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
no	1
case	1
abolished3	1
by	1
that	1
plan;	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
great	1
if	1
not	1
insurmountable	1
difficulties	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
making	1
any	1
precise	1
and	1
proper	1
provision	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
Constitution	1
for	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
The	1
best	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
least	1
anxious	1
for	1
a	1
constitutional	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
civil	1
cases,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
ready	1
to	1
admit	1
that	1
the	1
changes	1
which	1
are	1
continually	1
happening	1
in	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
society	1
may	1
render	1
a	1
different	1
mode	1
of	1
determining	1
questions	1
of	1
property	1
preferable	1
in	1
many	1
cases	1
in	1
which	1
that	1
mode	1
of	1
trial	1
now	1
prevails.	1
For	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
acknowledge	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
convinced	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
State	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
advantageously	1
extended	1
to	1
some	1
cases	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
at	1
present	1
apply,	1
and	1
might	1
as	1
advantageously	1
be	1
abridged	1
in	1
others.	1
It	1
is	1
conceded	1
by	1
all	1
reasonable	1
men	1
that	1
it	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
obtain	1
in	1
all	1
cases.	1
The	1
examples	1
of	1
innovations	1
which	1
contract	1
its	1
ancient	1
limits,	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
these	1
States	1
as	1
in	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
afford	1
a	1
strong	1
presumption	1
that	1
its	1
former	1
extent	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
inconvenient,	1
and	1
give	1
room	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
future	1
experience	1
may	1
discover	1
the	1
propriety	1
and	1
utility	1
of	1
other	1
exceptions.	1
I	1
suspect	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
impossible	1
in	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
to	1
fix	1
the	1
salutary	1
point	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
operation	1
of	1
the	1
institution	1
ought	1
to	1
stop,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
with	1
me	1
a	1
strong	1
argument	1
for	1
leaving	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
the	1
legislature.	1
This	1
is	1
now	1
clearly	1
understood	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
equally	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
Connecticut;	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
safely	1
affirmed	1
that	1
more	1
numerous	1
encroachments	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
upon	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
this	1
State	1
since	1
the	1
Revolution,	1
though	1
provided	1
for	1
by	1
a	1
positive	1
article	1
of	1
our	1
constitution,	1
than	1
has	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
either	1
in	1
Connecticut	1
or	1
Great	1
Britain.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
added	1
that	1
these	1
encroachments	1
have	1
generally	1
originated	1
with	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
endeavor	1
to	1
persuade	1
the	1
people	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
warmest	1
defenders	1
of	1
popular	1
liberty,	1
but	1
who	1
have	1
rarely	1
suffered	1
constitutional	1
obstacles	1
to	1
arrest	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
favorite	1
career.	1
The	1
truth	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
general	1
GENIUS	1
of	1
a	1
government	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
substantially	1
relied	1
upon	1
for	1
permanent	1
effects.	1
Particular	1
provisions,	1
though	1
not	1
altogether	1
useless,	1
have	1
far	1
less	1
virtue	1
and	1
efficacy	1
than	1
are	1
commonly	1
ascribed	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
never	1
be,	1
with	1
men	1
of	1
sound	1
discernment,	1
a	1
decisive	1
objection	1
to	1
any	1
plan	1
which	1
exhibits	1
the	1
leading	1
characters	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
government.	1
It	1
certainly	1
sounds	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
harsh	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
to	1
affirm	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
security	1
for	1
liberty	1
in	1
a	1
Constitution	1
which	1
expressly	1
establishes	1
the	1
trial	1
by	1
jury	1
in	1
criminal	1
cases,	1
because	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
civil	1
also;	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
notorious	1
fact	1
that	1
Connecticut,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
always	1
regarded	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
popular	1
State	1
in	1
the	1
Union,	1
can	1
boast	1
of	1
no	1
constitutional	1
provision	1
for	1
either.	1
PUBLIUS.	1
1	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
erroneously	1
insinuated,	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
chancery,	1
that	1
this	1
court	1
generally	1
tries	1
disputed	1
facts	1
by	1
a	1
jury.	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
that	1
references	1
to	1
a	1
jury	1
in	1
that	1
court	1
rarely	1
happen,	1
and	1
are	1
in	1
no	1
case	1
necessary	1
but	1
where	1
the	1
validity	1
of	1
a	1
devise	1
of	1
land	1
comes	1
into	1
question.	1
2	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
principles	1
by	1
which	1
that	1
relief	1
is	1
governed	1
are	1
now	1
reduced	1
to	1
a	1
regular	1
system;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
less	1
true	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
main	1
applicable	1
to	1
SPECIAL	1
circumstances,	1
which	1
form	1
exceptions	1
to	1
general	1
rules.	1

HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
IN	1
THE	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
foregoing	1
review	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
notice	1
of,	1
and	1
endeavored	1
to	1
answer	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
objections	1
which	1
have	1
appeared	1
against	1
it.	1
There,	1
however,	1
remain	1
a	1
few	1
which	1
either	1
did	1
not	1
fall	1
naturally	1
under	1
any	1
particular	1
head	1
or	1
were	1
forgotten	1
in	1
their	1
proper	1
places.	1
These	1
shall	1
now	1
be	1
discussed;	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
subject	1
has	1
been	1
drawn	1
into	1
great	1
length,	1
I	1
shall	1
so	1
far	1
consult	1
brevity	1
as	1
to	1
comprise	1
all	1
my	1
observations	1
on	1
these	1
miscellaneous	1
points	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
paper.	1
The	1
most	1
considerable	1
of	1
the	1
remaining	1
objections	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
contains	1
no	1
bill	1
of	1
rights.	1
Among	1
other	1
answers	1
given	1
to	1
this,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
upon	1
different	1
occasions	1
remarked	1
that	1
the	1
constitutions	1
of	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
predicament.	1
I	1
add	1
that	1
New	1
York	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
number.	1
And	1
yet	1
the	1
opposers	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
system,	1
in	1
this	1
State,	1
who	1
profess	1
an	1
unlimited	1
admiration	1
for	1
its	1
constitution,	1
are	1
among	1
the	1
most	1
intemperate	1
partisans	1
of	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
rights.	1
To	1
justify	1
their	1
zeal	1
in	1
this	1
matter,	1
they	1
allege	1
two	1
things:	1
one	1
is	1
that,	1
though	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
New	1
York	1
has	1
no	1
bill	1
of	1
rights	1
prefixed	1
to	1
it,	1
yet	1
it	1
contains,	1
in	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
it,	1
various	1
provisions	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
particular	1
privileges	1
and	1
rights,	1
which,	1
in	1
substance	1
amount	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
thing;	1
the	1
other	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
Constitution	1
adopts,	1
in	1
their	1
full	1
extent,	1
the	1
common	1
and	1
statute	1
law	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
by	1
which	1
many	1
other	1
rights,	1
not	1
expressed	1
in	1
it,	1
are	1
equally	1
secured.	1
To	1
the	1
first	1
I	1
answer,	1
that	1
the	1
Constitution	1
proposed	1
by	1
the	1
convention	1
contains,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
this	1
State,	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
such	1
provisions.	1
Independent	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
relate	1
to	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
we	1
find	1
the	1
following:	1
Article	1
1,	1
section	1
3,	1
clause	1
7	1
"Judgment	1
in	1
cases	1
of	1
impeachment	1
shall	1
not	1
extend	1
further	1
than	1
to	1
removal	1
from	1
office,	1
and	1
disqualification	1
to	1
hold	1
and	1
enjoy	1
any	1
office	1
of	1
honor,	1
trust,	1
or	1
profit	1
under	1
the	1
United	1
States;	1
but	1
the	1
party	1
convicted	1
shall,	1
nevertheless,	1
be	1
liable	1
and	1
subject	1
to	1
indictment,	1
trial,	1
judgment,	1
and	1
punishment	1
according	1
to	1
law."	1
Section	1
9,	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
article,	1
clause	1
2	1
"The	1
privilege	1
of	1
the	1
writ	1
of	1
habeas	1
corpus	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
suspended,	1
unless	1
when	1
in	1
cases	1
of	1
rebellion	1
or	1
invasion	1
the	1
public	1
safety	1
may	1
require	1
it."	1
Clause	1
3	1
"No	1
bill	1
of	1
attainder	1
or	1
ex-post-facto	1
law	1
shall	1
be	1
passed."	1
Clause	1
7	1
"No	1
title	1
of	1
nobility	1
shall	1
be	1
granted	1
by	1
the	1
United	1
States;	1
and	1
no	1
person	1
holding	1
any	1
office	1
of	1
profit	1
or	1
trust	1
under	1
them,	1
shall,	1
without	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
Congress,	1
accept	1
of	1
any	1
present,	1
emolument,	1
office,	1
or	1
title	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
whatever,	1
from	1
any	1
king,	1
prince,	1
or	1
foreign	1
state."	1
Article	1
3,	1
section	1
2,	1
clause	1
3	1
"The	1
trial	1
of	1
all	1
crimes,	1
except	1
in	1
cases	1
of	1
impeachment,	1
shall	1
be	1
by	1
jury;	1
and	1
such	1
trial	1
shall	1
be	1
held	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
where	1
the	1
said	1
crimes	1
shall	1
have	1
been	1
committed;	1
but	1
when	1
not	1
committed	1
within	1
any	1
State,	1
the	1
trial	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
such	1
place	1
or	1
places	1
as	1
the	1
Congress	1
may	1
by	1
law	1
have	1
directed."	1
Section	1
3,	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
article	1
"Treason	1
against	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
shall	1
consist	1
only	1
in	1
levying	1
war	1
against	1
them,	1
or	1
in	1
adhering	1
to	1
their	1
enemies,	1
giving	1
them	1
aid	1
and	1
comfort.	1
No	1
person	1
shall	1
be	1
convicted	1
of	1
treason,	1
unless	1
on	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
two	1
witnesses	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
overt	1
act,	1
or	1
on	1
confession	1
in	1
open	1
court."	1
And	1
clause	1
3,	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
section	1
"The	1
Congress	1
shall	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
declare	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
treason;	1
but	1
no	1
attainder	1
of	1
treason	1
shall	1
work	1
corruption	1
of	1
blood,	1
or	1
forfeiture,	1
except	1
during	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
attainted."	1
It	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
a	1
question,	1
whether	1
these	1
are	1
not,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
of	1
equal	1
importance	1
with	1
any	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
this	1
State.	1
The	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
writ	1
of	1
habeas	1
corpus,	1
the	1
prohibition	1
of	1
ex-post-facto	1
laws,	1
and	1
of	1
TITLES	1
OF	1
NOBILITY,	1
TO	1
WHICH	1
WE	1
HAVE	1
NO	1
CORRESPONDING	1
PROVISION	1
IN	1
OUR	1
CONSTITUTION,	1
are	1
perhaps	1
greater	1
securities	1
to	1
liberty	1
and	1
republicanism	1
than	1
any	1
it	1
contains.	1
The	1
creation	1
of	1
crimes	1
after	1
the	1
commission	1
of	1
the	1
fact,	1
or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
the	1
subjecting	1
of	1
men	1
to	1
punishment	1
for	1
things	1
which,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
done,	1
were	1
breaches	1
of	1
no	1
law,	1
and	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
arbitrary	1
imprisonments,	1
have	1
been,	1
in	1
all	1
ages,	1
the	1
favorite	1
and	1
most	1
formidable	1
instruments	1
of	1
tyranny.	1
The	1
observations	1
of	1
the	1
judicious	1
Blackstone,1	1
in	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
latter,	1
are	1
well	1
worthy	1
of	1
recital:	1
"To	1
bereave	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
life,	1
Usays	1
he,e	1
or	1
by	1
violence	1
to	1
confiscate	1
his	1
estate,	1
without	1
accusation	1
or	1
trial,	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
gross	1
and	1
notorious	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
despotism,	1
as	1
must	1
at	1
once	1
convey	1
the	1
alarm	1
of	1
tyranny	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
nation;	1
but	1
confinement	1
of	1
the	1
person,	1
by	1
secretly	1
hurrying	1
him	1
to	1
jail,	1
where	1
his	1
sufferings	1
are	1
unknown	1
or	1
forgotten,	1
is	1
a	1
less	1
public,	1
a	1
less	1
striking,	1
and	1
therefore	1
A	1
MORE	1
DANGEROUS	1
ENGINE	1
of	1
arbitrary	1
government."	1
And	1
as	1
a	1
remedy	1
for	1
this	1
fatal	1
evil	1
he	1
is	1
everywhere	1
peculiarly	1
emphatical	1
in	1
his	1
encomiums	1
on	1
the	1
habeas-corpus	1
act,	1
which	1
in	1
one	1
place	1
he	1
calls	1
"the	1
BULWARK	1
of	1
the	1
British	1
Constitution."2	1
Nothing	1
need	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
illustrate	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
the	1
prohibition	1
of	1
titles	1
of	1
nobility.	1
This	1
may	1
truly	1
be	1
denominated	1
the	1
corner-stone	1
of	1
republican	1
government;	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
excluded,	1
there	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
serious	1
danger	1
that	1
the	1
government	1
will	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
To	1
the	1
second	1
that	1
is,	1
to	1
the	1
pretended	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
and	1
state	1
law	1
by	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
I	1
answer,	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
expressly	1
made	1
subject	1
"to	1
such	1
alterations	1
and	1
provisions	1
as	1
the	1
legislature	1
shall	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
make	1
concerning	1
the	1
same."	1
They	1
are	1
therefore	1
at	1
any	1
moment	1
liable	1
to	1
repeal	1
by	1
the	1
ordinary	1
legislative	1
power,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
have	1
no	1
constitutional	1
sanction.	1
The	1
only	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
declaration	1
was	1
to	1
recognize	1
the	1
ancient	1
law	1
and	1
to	1
remove	1
doubts	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
occasioned	1
by	1
the	1
Revolution.	1
This	1
consequently	1
can	1
be	1
considered	1
as	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
declaration	1
of	1
rights,	1
which	1
under	1
our	1
constitutions	1
must	1
be	1
intended	1
as	1
limitations	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
itself.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
several	1
times	1
truly	1
remarked	1
that	1
bills	1
of	1
rights	1
are,	1
in	1
their	1
origin,	1
stipulations	1
between	1
kings	1
and	1
their	1
subjects,	1
abridgements	1
of	1
prerogative	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
privilege,	1
reservations	1
of	1
rights	1
not	1
surrendered	1
to	1
the	1
prince.	1
Such	1
was	1
MAGNA	1
CHARTA,	1
obtained	1
by	1
the	1
barons,	1
sword	1
in	1
hand,	1
from	1
King	1
John.	1
Such	1
were	1
the	1
subsequent	1
confirmations	1
of	1
that	1
charter	1
by	1
succeeding	1
princes.	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
PETITION	1
OF	1
RIGHT	1
assented	1
to	1
by	1
Charles	1
I.,	1
in	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
his	1
reign.	1
Such,	1
also,	1
was	1
the	1
Declaration	1
of	1
Right	1
presented	1
by	1
the	1
Lords	1
and	1
Commons	1
to	1
the	1
Prince	1
of	1
Orange	1
in	1
1688,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
parliament	1
called	1
the	1
Bill	1
of	1
Rights.	1
It	1
is	1
evident,	1
therefore,	1
that,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
primitive	1
signification,	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
application	1
to	1
constitutions	1
professedly	1
founded	1
upon	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
and	1
executed	1
by	1
their	1
immediate	1
representatives	1
and	1
servants.	1
Here,	1
in	1
strictness,	1
the	1
people	1
surrender	1
nothing;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
retain	1
every	1
thing	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
particular	1
reservations.	1
"WE,	1
THE	1
PEOPLE	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States,	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
blessings	1
of	1
liberty	1
to	1
ourselves	1
and	1
our	1
posterity,	1
do	1
ORDAIN	1
and	1
ESTABLISH	1
this	1
Constitution	1
for	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
of	1
America."	1
Here	1
is	1
a	1
better	1
recognition	1
of	1
popular	1
rights,	1
than	1
volumes	1
of	1
those	1
aphorisms	1
which	1
make	1
the	1
principal	1
figure	1
in	1
several	1
of	1
our	1
State	1
bills	1
of	1
rights,	1
and	1
which	1
would	1
sound	1
much	1
better	1
in	1
a	1
treatise	1
of	1
ethics	1
than	1
in	1
a	1
constitution	1
of	1
government.	1
But	1
a	1
minute	1
detail	1
of	1
particular	1
rights	1
is	1
certainly	1
far	1
less	1
applicable	1
to	1
a	1
Constitution	1
like	1
that	1
under	1
consideration,	1
which	1
is	1
merely	1
intended	1
to	1
regulate	1
the	1
general	1
political	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
nation,	1
than	1
to	1
a	1
constitution	1
which	1
has	1
the	1
regulation	1
of	1
every	1
species	1
of	1
personal	1
and	1
private	1
concerns.	1
If,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
loud	1
clamors	1
against	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention,	1
on	1
this	1
score,	1
are	1
well	1
founded,	1
no	1
epithets	1
of	1
reprobation	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
this	1
State.	1
But	1
the	1
truth	1
is,	1
that	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
contain	1
all	1
which,	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
their	1
objects,	1
is	1
reasonably	1
to	1
be	1
desired.	1
I	1
go	1
further,	1
and	1
affirm	1
that	1
bills	1
of	1
rights,	1
in	1
the	1
sense	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
contended	1
for,	1
are	1
not	1
only	1
unnecessary	1
in	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
but	1
would	1
even	1
be	1
dangerous.	1
They	1
would	1
contain	1
various	1
exceptions	1
to	1
powers	1
not	1
granted;	1
and,	1
on	1
this	1
very	1
account,	1
would	1
afford	1
a	1
colorable	1
pretext	1
to	1
claim	1
more	1
than	1
were	1
granted.	1
For	1
why	1
declare	1
that	1
things	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
done	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
do?	1
Why,	1
for	1
instance,	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
press	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
restrained,	1
when	1
no	1
power	1
is	1
given	1
by	1
which	1
restrictions	1
may	1
be	1
imposed?	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
contend	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
provision	1
would	1
confer	1
a	1
regulating	1
power;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
furnish,	1
to	1
men	1
disposed	1
to	1
usurp,	1
a	1
plausible	1
pretense	1
for	1
claiming	1
that	1
power.	1
They	1
might	1
urge	1
with	1
a	1
semblance	1
of	1
reason,	1
that	1
the	1
Constitution	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
charged	1
with	1
the	1
absurdity	1
of	1
providing	1
against	1
the	1
abuse	1
of	1
an	1
authority	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
given,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
provision	1
against	1
restraining	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
press	1
afforded	1
a	1
clear	1
implication,	1
that	1
a	1
power	1
to	1
prescribe	1
proper	1
regulations	1
concerning	1
it	1
was	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
vested	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
government.	1
This	1
may	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
specimen	1
of	1
the	1
numerous	1
handles	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
doctrine	1
of	1
constructive	1
powers,	1
by	1
the	1
indulgence	1
of	1
an	1
injudicious	1
zeal	1
for	1
bills	1
of	1
rights.	1
On	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
press,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
I	1
cannot	1
forbear	1
adding	1
a	1
remark	1
or	1
two:	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
I	1
observe,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
syllable	1
concerning	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
this	1
State;	1
in	1
the	1
next,	1
I	1
contend,	1
that	1
whatever	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
State,	1
amounts	1
to	1
nothing.	1
What	1
signifies	1
a	1
declaration,	1
that	1
"the	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
press	1
shall	1
be	1
inviolably	1
preserved"?	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
press?	1
Who	1
can	1
give	1
it	1
any	1
definition	1
which	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
utmost	1
latitude	1
for	1
evasion?	1
I	1
hold	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
impracticable;	1
and	1
from	1
this	1
I	1
infer,	1
that	1
its	1
security,	1
whatever	1
fine	1
declarations	1
may	1
be	1
inserted	1
in	1
any	1
constitution	1
respecting	1
it,	1
must	1
altogether	1
depend	1
on	1
public	1
opinion,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
general	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
government.3	1
And	1
here,	1
after	1
all,	1
as	1
is	1
intimated	1
upon	1
another	1
occasion,	1
must	1
we	1
seek	1
for	1
the	1
only	1
solid	1
basis	1
of	1
all	1
our	1
rights.	1
There	1
remains	1
but	1
one	1
other	1
view	1
of	1
this	1
matter	1
to	1
conclude	1
the	1
point.	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
declamations	1
we	1
have	1
heard,	1
that	1
the	1
Constitution	1
is	1
itself,	1
in	1
every	1
rational	1
sense,	1
and	1
to	1
every	1
useful	1
purpose,	1
A	1
BILL	1
OF	1
RIGHTS.	1
The	1
several	1
bills	1
of	1
rights	1
in	1
Great	1
Britain	1
form	1
its	1
Constitution,	1
and	1
conversely	1
the	1
constitution	1
of	1
each	1
State	1
is	1
its	1
bill	1
of	1
rights.	1
And	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
if	1
adopted,	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
bill	1
of	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
Is	1
it	1
one	1
object	1
of	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
rights	1
to	1
declare	1
and	1
specify	1
the	1
political	1
privileges	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
in	1
the	1
structure	1
and	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
government?	1
This	1
is	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
ample	1
and	1
precise	1
manner	1
in	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention;	1
comprehending	1
various	1
precautions	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
security,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions.	1
Is	1
another	1
object	1
of	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
rights	1
to	1
define	1
certain	1
immunities	1
and	1
modes	1
of	1
proceeding,	1
which	1
are	1
relative	1
to	1
personal	1
and	1
private	1
concerns?	1
This	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
has	1
also	1
been	1
attended	1
to,	1
in	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
cases,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
plan.	1
Adverting	1
therefore	1
to	1
the	1
substantial	1
meaning	1
of	1
a	1
bill	1
of	1
rights,	1
it	1
is	1
absurd	1
to	1
allege	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
convention.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
go	1
far	1
enough,	1
though	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
easy	1
to	1
make	1
this	1
appear;	1
but	1
it	1
can	1
with	1
no	1
propriety	1
be	1
contended	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
such	1
thing.	1
It	1
certainly	1
must	1
be	1
immaterial	1
what	1
mode	1
is	1
observed	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
declaring	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
citizens,	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
instrument	1
which	1
establishes	1
the	1
government.	1
And	1
hence	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
apparent,	1
that	1
much	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
rests	1
merely	1
on	1
verbal	1
and	1
nominal	1
distinctions,	1
entirely	1
foreign	1
from	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
the	1
thing.	1
Another	1
objection	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
made,	1
and	1
which,	1
from	1
the	1
frequency	1
of	1
its	1
repetition,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
presumed	1
is	1
relied	1
on,	1
is	1
of	1
this	1
nature:	1
"It	1
is	1
improper,"	1
say	1
the	1
objectors,	1
"to	1
confer	1
such	1
large	1
powers,	1
as	1
are	1
proposed,	1
upon	1
the	1
national	1
government,	1
because	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
that	1
government	1
must	1
of	1
necessity	1
be	1
too	1
remote	1
from	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
to	1
admit	1
of	1
a	1
proper	1
knowledge	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
constituent,	1
of	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
representative	1
body."	1
This	1
argument,	1
if	1
it	1
proves	1
any	1
thing,	1
proves	1
that	1
there	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
general	1
government	1
whatever.	1
For	1
the	1
powers	1
which,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
agreed	1
on	1
all	1
hands,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
vested	1
in	1
the	1
Union,	1
cannot	1
be	1
safely	1
intrusted	1
to	1
a	1
body	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
under	1
every	1
requisite	1
control.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
satisfactory	1
reasons	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
objection	1
is	1
in	1
reality	1
not	1
well	1
founded.	1
There	1
is	1
in	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
arguments	1
which	1
relate	1
to	1
distance	1
a	1
palpable	1
illusion	1
of	1
the	1
imagination.	1
What	1
are	1
the	1
sources	1
of	1
information	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
Montgomery	1
County	1
must	1
regulate	1
their	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
their	1
representatives	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
legislature?	1
Of	1
personal	1
observation	1
they	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
benefit.	1
This	1
is	1
confined	1
to	1
the	1
citizens	1
on	1
the	1
spot.	1
They	1
must	1
therefore	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
information	1
of	1
intelligent	1
men,	1
in	1
whom	1
they	1
confide;	1
and	1
how	1
must	1
these	1
men	1
obtain	1
their	1
information?	1
Evidently	1
from	1
the	1
complexion	1
of	1
public	1
measures,	1
from	1
the	1
public	1
prints,	1
from	1
correspondences	1
with	1
their	1
representatives,	1
and	1
with	1
other	1
persons	1
who	1
reside	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
their	1
deliberations.	1
This	1
does	1
not	1
apply	1
to	1
Montgomery	1
County	1
only,	1
but	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
counties	1
at	1
any	1
considerable	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
government.	1
It	1
is	1
equally	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
sources	1
of	1
information	1
would	1
be	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
their	1
representatives	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
government,	1
and	1
the	1
impediments	1
to	1
a	1
prompt	1
communication	1
which	1
distance	1
may	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
create,	1
will	1
be	1
overbalanced	1
by	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
the	1
vigilance	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments.	1
The	1
executive	1
and	1
legislative	1
bodies	1
of	1
each	1
State	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
many	1
sentinels	1
over	1
the	1
persons	1
employed	1
in	1
every	1
department	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
administration;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
their	1
power	1
to	1
adopt	1
and	1
pursue	1
a	1
regular	1
and	1
effectual	1
system	1
of	1
intelligence,	1
they	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
behavior	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
represent	1
their	1
constituents	1
in	1
the	1
national	1
councils,	1
and	1
can	1
readily	1
communicate	1
the	1
same	1
knowledge	1
to	1
the	1
people.	1
Their	1
disposition	1
to	1
apprise	1
the	1
community	1
of	1
whatever	1
may	1
prejudice	1
its	1
interests	1
from	1
another	1
quarter,	1
may	1
be	1
relied	1
upon,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
from	1
the	1
rivalship	1
of	1
power.	1
And	1
we	1
may	1
conclude	1
with	1
the	1
fullest	1
assurance	1
that	1
the	1
people,	1
through	1
that	1
channel,	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
informed	1
of	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
their	1
national	1
representatives,	1
than	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
they	1
now	1
possess	1
of	1
that	1
of	1
their	1
State	1
representatives.	1
It	1
ought	1
also	1
to	1
be	1
remembered	1
that	1
the	1
citizens	1
who	1
inhabit	1
the	1
country	1
at	1
and	1
near	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
government	1
will,	1
in	1
all	1
questions	1
that	1
affect	1
the	1
general	1
liberty	1
and	1
prosperity,	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
interest	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
at	1
a	1
distance,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
stand	1
ready	1
to	1
sound	1
the	1
alarm	1
when	1
necessary,	1
and	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
the	1
actors	1
in	1
any	1
pernicious	1
project.	1
The	1
public	1
papers	1
will	1
be	1
expeditious	1
messengers	1
of	1
intelligence	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
remote	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1
Among	1
the	1
many	1
curious	1
objections	1
which	1
have	1
appeared	1
against	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
and	1
the	1
least	1
colorable	1
is	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
some	1
provision	1
respecting	1
the	1
debts	1
due	1
TO	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
This	1
has	1
been	1
represented	1
as	1
a	1
tacit	1
relinquishment	1
of	1
those	1
debts,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
wicked	1
contrivance	1
to	1
screen	1
public	1
defaulters.	1
The	1
newspapers	1
have	1
teemed	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
inflammatory	1
railings	1
on	1
this	1
head;	1
yet	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
clearer	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
suggestion	1
is	1
entirely	1
void	1
of	1
foundation,	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
extreme	1
ignorance	1
or	1
extreme	1
dishonesty.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
remarks	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
upon	1
the	1
subject	1
in	1
another	1
place,	1
I	1
shall	1
only	1
observe	1
that	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
plain	1
dictate	1
of	1
common-sense,	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
also	1
an	1
established	1
doctrine	1
of	1
political	1
law,	1
that	1
"STATES	1
NEITHER	1
LOSE	1
ANY	1
OF	1
THEIR	1
RIGHTS,	1
NOR	1
ARE	1
DISCHARGED	1
FROM	1
ANY	1
OF	1
THEIR	1
OBLIGATIONS,	1
BY	1
A	1
CHANGE	1
IN	1
THE	1
FORM	1
OF	1
THEIR	1
CIVIL	1
GOVERNMENT."4	1
The	1
last	1
objection	1
of	1
any	1
consequence,	1
which	1
I	1
at	1
present	1
recollect,	1
turns	1
upon	1
the	1
article	1
of	1
expense.	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
even	1
true,	1
that	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
government	1
would	1
occasion	1
a	1
considerable	1
increase	1
of	1
expense,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
objection	1
that	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
weight	1
against	1
the	1
plan.	1
The	1
great	1
bulk	1
of	1
the	1
citizens	1
of	1
America	1
are	1
with	1
reason	1
convinced,	1
that	1
Union	1
is	1
the	1
basis	1
of	1
their	1
political	1
happiness.	1
Men	1
of	1
sense	1
of	1
all	1
parties	1
now,	1
with	1
few	1
exceptions,	1
agree	1
that	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
preserved	1
under	1
the	1
present	1
system,	1
nor	1
without	1
radical	1
alterations;	1
that	1
new	1
and	1
extensive	1
powers	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
granted	1
to	1
the	1
national	1
head,	1
and	1
that	1
these	1
require	1
a	1
different	1
organization	1
of	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
a	1
single	1
body	1
being	1
an	1
unsafe	1
depositary	1
of	1
such	1
ample	1
authorities.	1
In	1
conceding	1
all	1
this,	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
expense	1
must	1
be	1
given	1
up;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,	1
with	1
any	1
degree	1
of	1
safety,	1
to	1
narrow	1
the	1
foundation	1
upon	1
which	1
the	1
system	1
is	1
to	1
stand.	1
The	1
two	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
legislature	1
are,	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance,	1
to	1
consist	1
of	1
only	1
sixty-five	1
persons,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
number	1
of	1
which	1
Congress,	1
under	1
the	1
existing	1
Confederation,	1
may	1
be	1
composed.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
this	1
number	1
is	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
increased;	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
to	1
keep	1
pace	1
with	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
population	1
and	1
resources	1
of	1
the	1
country.	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
a	1
less	1
number	1
would,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance,	1
have	1
been	1
unsafe,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
continuance	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
number	1
would,	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
advanced	1
stage	1
of	1
population,	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
inadequate	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
Whence	1
is	1
the	1
dreaded	1
augmentation	1
of	1
expense	1
to	1
spring?	1
One	1
source	1
indicated,	1
is	1
the	1
multiplication	1
of	1
offices	1
under	1
the	1
new	1
government.	1
Let	1
us	1
examine	1
this	1
a	1
little.	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
principal	1
departments	1
of	1
the	1
administration	1
under	1
the	1
present	1
government,	1
are	1
the	1
same	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
required	1
under	1
the	1
new.	1
There	1
are	1
now	1
a	1
Secretary	1
of	1
War,	1
a	1
Secretary	1
of	1
Foreign	1
Affairs,	1
a	1
Secretary	1
for	1
Domestic	1
Affairs,	1
a	1
Board	1
of	1
Treasury,	1
consisting	1
of	1
three	1
persons,	1
a	1
Treasurer,	1
assistants,	1
clerks,	1
etc.	1
These	1
officers	1
are	1
indispensable	1
under	1
any	1
system,	1
and	1
will	1
suffice	1
under	1
the	1
new	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
old.	1
As	1
to	1
ambassadors	1
and	1
other	1
ministers	1
and	1
agents	1
in	1
foreign	1
countries,	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
can	1
make	1
no	1
other	1
difference	1
than	1
to	1
render	1
their	1
characters,	1
where	1
they	1
reside,	1
more	1
respectable,	1
and	1
their	1
services	1
more	1
useful.	1
As	1
to	1
persons	1
to	1
be	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
collection	1
of	1
the	1
revenues,	1
it	1
is	1
unquestionably	1
true	1
that	1
these	1
will	1
form	1
a	1
very	1
considerable	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
federal	1
officers;	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
follow	1
that	1
this	1
will	1
occasion	1
an	1
increase	1
of	1
public	1
expense.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
most	1
cases	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
exchange	1
of	1
State	1
for	1
national	1
officers.	1
In	1
the	1
collection	1
of	1
all	1
duties,	1
for	1
instance,	1
the	1
persons	1
employed	1
will	1
be	1
wholly	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
description.	1
The	1
States	1
individually	1
will	1
stand	1
in	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
any	1
for	1
this	1
purpose.	1
What	1
difference	1
can	1
it	1
make	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
expense	1
to	1
pay	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
customs	1
appointed	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
United	1
States?	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
good	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
either	1
the	1
number	1
or	1
the	1
salaries	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
will	1
be	1
greater	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
former.	1
Where	1
then	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
those	1
additional	1
articles	1
of	1
expense	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
swell	1
the	1
account	1
to	1
the	1
enormous	1
size	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
represented	1
to	1
us?	1
The	1
chief	1
item	1
which	1
occurs	1
to	1
me	1
respects	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
add	1
the	1
President,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
now	1
a	1
president	1
of	1
Congress,	1
whose	1
expenses	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
far,	1
if	1
any	1
thing,	1
short	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
incurred	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
President	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
The	1
support	1
of	1
the	1
judges	1
will	1
clearly	1
be	1
an	1
extra	1
expense,	1
but	1
to	1
what	1
extent	1
will	1
depend	1
on	1
the	1
particular	1
plan	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
adopted	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
matter.	1
But	1
upon	1
no	1
reasonable	1
plan	1
can	1
it	1
amount	1
to	1
a	1
sum	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
material	1
consequence.	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
see	1
what	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
counterbalance	1
any	1
extra	1
expense	1
that	1
may	1
attend	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
government.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
which	1
presents	1
itself	1
is	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
which	1
now	1
keeps	1
Congress	1
sitting	1
through	1
the	1
year	1
will	1
be	1
transacted	1
by	1
the	1
President.	1
Even	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
foreign	1
negotiations	1
will	1
naturally	1
devolve	1
upon	1
him,	1
according	1
to	1
general	1
principles	1
concerted	1
with	1
the	1
Senate,	1
and	1
subject	1
to	1
their	1
final	1
concurrence.	1
Hence	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
will	1
suffice	1
for	1
the	1
session	1
of	1
both	1
the	1
Senate	1
and	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives;	1
we	1
may	1
suppose	1
about	1
a	1
fourth	1
for	1
the	1
latter	1
and	1
a	1
third,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
half,	1
for	1
the	1
former.	1
The	1
extra	1
business	1
of	1
treaties	1
and	1
appointments	1
may	1
give	1
this	1
extra	1
occupation	1
to	1
the	1
Senate.	1
From	1
this	1
circumstance	1
we	1
may	1
infer	1
that,	1
until	1
the	1
House	1
of	1
Representatives	1
shall	1
be	1
increased	1
greatly	1
beyond	1
its	1
present	1
number,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
considerable	1
saving	1
of	1
expense	1
from	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
constant	1
session	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
and	1
the	1
temporary	1
session	1
of	1
the	1
future	1
Congress.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
circumstance	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
in	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
economy.	1
The	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
has	1
hitherto	1
occupied	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Congress.	1
The	1
latter	1
has	1
made	1
requisitions	1
which	1
the	1
former	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
provide	1
for.	1
Hence	1
it	1
has	1
happened	1
that	1
the	1
sessions	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
have	1
been	1
protracted	1
greatly	1
beyond	1
what	1
was	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
mere	1
local	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
States.	1
More	1
than	1
half	1
their	1
time	1
has	1
been	1
frequently	1
employed	1
in	1
matters	1
which	1
related	1
to	1
the	1
United	1
States.	1
Now	1
the	1
members	1
who	1
compose	1
the	1
legislatures	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
States	1
amount	1
to	1
two	1
thousand	1
and	1
upwards,	1
which	1
number	1
has	1
hitherto	1
performed	1
what	1
under	1
the	1
new	1
system	1
will	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance	1
by	1
sixty-five	1
persons,	1
and	1
probably	1
at	1
no	1
future	1
period	1
by	1
above	1
a	1
fourth	1
or	1
fifth	1
of	1
that	1
number.	1
The	1
Congress	1
under	1
the	1
proposed	1
government	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
themselves,	1
without	1
the	1
intervention	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
who	1
thenceforth	1
will	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
affairs	1
of	1
their	1
particular	1
States,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
to	1
sit	1
in	1
any	1
proportion	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
heretofore	1
done.	1
This	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
sessions	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
will	1
be	1
clear	1
gain,	1
and	1
will	1
alone	1
form	1
an	1
article	1
of	1
saving,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
an	1
equivalent	1
for	1
any	1
additional	1
objects	1
of	1
expense	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
occasioned	1
by	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
system.	1
The	1
result	1
from	1
these	1
observations	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
sources	1
of	1
additional	1
expense	1
from	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
are	1
much	1
fewer	1
than	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
imagined;	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
counterbalanced	1
by	1
considerable	1
objects	1
of	1
saving;	1
and	1
that	1
while	1
it	1
is	1
questionable	1
on	1
which	1
side	1
the	1
scale	1
will	1
preponderate,	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
a	1
government	1
less	1
expensive	1
would	1
be	1
incompetent	1
to	1
the	1
purposes	1
of	1
the	1
Union.	1

prohibition.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
by	1
what	1
logic	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
maintained,	1
that	1
the	1
declarations	1
in	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions,	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
the	1
freedom	1
of	1
the	1
press,	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
constitutional	1
impediment	1
to	1
the	1
imposition	1
of	1
duties	1
upon	1
publications	1
by	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures.	1
It	1
cannot	1
certainly	1
be	1
pretended	1
that	1
any	1
degree	1
of	1
duties,	1
however	1
low,	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
abridgment	1
of	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
press.	1
We	1
know	1
that	1
newspapers	1
are	1
taxed	1
in	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
is	1
notorious	1
that	1
the	1
press	1
nowhere	1
enjoys	1
greater	1
liberty	1
than	1
in	1
that	1
country.	1
And	1
if	1
duties	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
may	1
be	1
laid	1
without	1
a	1
violation	1
of	1
that	1
liberty,	1
it	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
the	1
extent	1
must	1
depend	1
on	1
legislative	1
discretion,	1
respecting	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
press,	1
will	1
give	1
it	1
no	1
greater	1
security	1
than	1
it	1
will	1
have	1
without	1
them.	1
The	1
same	1
invasions	1
of	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
effected	1
under	1
the	1
State	1
constitutions	1
which	1
contain	1
those	1
declarations	1
through	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
taxation,	1
as	1
under	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution,	1
which	1
has	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
as	1
significant	1
to	1
declare	1
that	1
government	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
free,	1
that	1
taxes	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
excessive,	1
etc.,	1
as	1
that	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
press	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
restrained.	1

Concluding	1
Remarks	1
From	1
MCLEAN's	1
Edition,	1
New	1
York.	1
HAMILTON	1
To	1
the	1
People	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
of	1
New	1
York:	1
ACCORDING	1
to	1
the	1
formal	1
division	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
these	1
papers,	1
announced	1
in	1
my	1
first	1
number,	1
there	1
would	1
appear	1
still	1
to	1
remain	1
for	1
discussion	1
two	1
points:	1
"the	1
analogy	1
of	1
the	1
proposed	1
government	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
State	1
constitution,"	1
and	1
"the	1
additional	1
security	1
which	1
its	1
adoption	1
will	1
afford	1
to	1
republican	1
government,	1
to	1
liberty,	1
and	1
to	1
property."	1
But	1
these	1
heads	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
fully	1
anticipated	1
and	1
exhausted	1
in	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
the	1
work,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
now	1
scarcely	1
be	1
possible	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
thing	1
more	1
than	1
repeat,	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
dilated	1
form,	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
heretofore	1
said,	1
which	1
the	1
advanced	1
stage	1
of	1
the	1
question,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
already	1
spent	1
upon	1
it,	1
conspire	1
to	1
forbid.	1
It	1
is	1
remarkable,	1
that	1
the	1
resemblance	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
to	1
the	1
act	1
which	1
organizes	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
this	1
State	1
holds,	1
not	1
less	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
supposed	1
defects,	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
real	1
excellences	1
of	1
the	1
former.	1
Among	1
the	1
pretended	1
defects	1
are	1
the	1
re-eligibility	1
of	1
the	1
Executive,	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
council,	1
the	1
omission	1
of	1
a	1
formal	1
bill	1
of	1
rights,	1
the	1
omission	1
of	1
a	1
provision	1
respecting	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
the	1
press.	1
These	1
and	1
several	1
others	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
noted	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
our	1
inquiries	1
are	1
as	1
much	1
chargeable	1
on	1
the	1
existing	1
constitution	1
of	1
this	1
State,	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
proposed	1
for	1
the	1
Union;	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
must	1
have	1
slender	1
pretensions	1
to	1
consistency,	1
who	1
can	1
rail	1
at	1
the	1
latter	1
for	1
imperfections	1
which	1
he	1
finds	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
excusing	1
in	1
the	1
former.	1
Nor	1
indeed	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
better	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
insincerity	1
and	1
affectation	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
zealous	1
adversaries	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
of	1
the	1
convention	1
among	1
us,	1
who	1
profess	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
devoted	1
admirers	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
under	1
which	1
they	1
live,	1
than	1
the	1
fury	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
attacked	1
that	1
plan,	1
for	1
matters	1
in	1
regard	1
to	1
which	1
our	1
own	1
constitution	1
is	1
equally	1
or	1
perhaps	1
more	1
vulnerable.	1
The	1
additional	1
securities	1
to	1
republican	1
government,	1
to	1
liberty	1
and	1
to	1
property,	1
to	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
adoption	1
of	1
the	1
plan	1
under	1
consideration,	1
consist	1
chiefly	1
in	1
the	1
restraints	1
which	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
the	1
Union	1
will	1
impose	1
on	1
local	1
factions	1
and	1
insurrections,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
ambition	1
of	1
powerful	1
individuals	1
in	1
single	1
States,	1
who	1
may	1
acquire	1
credit	1
and	1
influence	1
enough,	1
from	1
leaders	1
and	1
favorites,	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
despots	1
of	1
the	1
people;	1
in	1
the	1
diminution	1
of	1
the	1
opportunities	1
to	1
foreign	1
intrigue,	1
which	1
the	1
dissolution	1
of	1
the	1
Confederacy	1
would	1
invite	1
and	1
facilitate;	1
in	1
the	1
prevention	1
of	1
extensive	1
military	1
establishments,	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
grow	1
out	1
of	1
wars	1
between	1
the	1
States	1
in	1
a	1
disunited	1
situation;	1
in	1
the	1
express	1
guaranty	1
of	1
a	1
republican	1
form	1
of	1
government	1
to	1
each;	1
in	1
the	1
absolute	1
and	1
universal	1
exclusion	1
of	1
titles	1
of	1
nobility;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
precautions	1
against	1
the	1
repetition	1
of	1
those	1
practices	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
governments	1
which	1
have	1
undermined	1
the	1
foundations	1
of	1
property	1
and	1
credit,	1
have	1
planted	1
mutual	1
distrust	1
in	1
the	1
breasts	1
of	1
all	1
classes	1
of	1
citizens,	1
and	1
have	1
occasioned	1
an	1
almost	1
universal	1
prostration	1
of	1
morals.	1
Thus	1
have	1
I,	1
fellow-citizens,	1
executed	1
the	1
task	1
I	1
had	1
assigned	1
to	1
myself;	1
with	1
what	1
success,	1
your	1
conduct	1
must	1
determine.	1
I	1
trust	1
at	1
least	1
you	1
will	1
admit	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
failed	1
in	1
the	1
assurance	1
I	1
gave	1
you	1
respecting	1
the	1
spirit	1
with	1
which	1
my	1
endeavors	1
should	1
be	1
conducted.	1
I	1
have	1
addressed	1
myself	1
purely	1
to	1
your	1
judgments,	1
and	1
have	1
studiously	1
avoided	1
those	1
asperities	1
which	1
are	1
too	1
apt	1
to	1
disgrace	1
political	1
disputants	1
of	1
all	1
parties,	1
and	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
provoked	1
by	1
the	1
language	1
and	1
conduct	1
of	1
the	1
opponents	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
The	1
charge	1
of	1
a	1
conspiracy	1
against	1
the	1
liberties	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
indiscriminately	1
brought	1
against	1
the	1
advocates	1
of	1
the	1
plan,	1
has	1
something	1
in	1
it	1
too	1
wanton	1
and	1
too	1
malignant,	1
not	1
to	1
excite	1
the	1
indignation	1
of	1
every	1
man	1
who	1
feels	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
bosom	1
a	1
refutation	1
of	1
the	1
calumny.	1
The	1
perpetual	1
changes	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
rung	1
upon	1
the	1
wealthy,	1
the	1
well-born,	1
and	1
the	1
great,	1
have	1
been	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
inspire	1
the	1
disgust	1
of	1
all	1
sensible	1
men.	1
And	1
the	1
unwarrantable	1
concealments	1
and	1
misrepresentations	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
various	1
ways	1
practiced	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
truth	1
from	1
the	1
public	1
eye,	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
a	1
nature	1
to	1
demand	1
the	1
reprobation	1
of	1
all	1
honest	1
men.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
impossible	1
that	1
these	1
circumstances	1
may	1
have	1
occasionally	1
betrayed	1
me	1
into	1
intemperances	1
of	1
expression	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
intend;	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
frequently	1
felt	1
a	1
struggle	1
between	1
sensibility	1
and	1
moderation;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
former	1
has	1
in	1
some	1
instances	1
prevailed,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
my	1
excuse	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
neither	1
often	1
nor	1
much.	1
Let	1
us	1
now	1
pause	1
and	1
ask	1
ourselves	1
whether,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
these	1
papers,	1
the	1
proposed	1
Constitution	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
satisfactorily	1
vindicated	1
from	1
the	1
aspersions	1
thrown	1
upon	1
it;	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
shown	1
to	1
be	1
worthy	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
approbation,	1
and	1
necessary	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
safety	1
and	1
prosperity.	1
Every	1
man	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
answer	1
these	1
questions	1
to	1
himself,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
his	1
conscience	1
and	1
understanding,	1
and	1
to	1
act	1
agreeably	1
to	1
the	1
genuine	1
and	1
sober	1
dictates	1
of	1
his	1
judgment.	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
duty	1
from	1
which	1
nothing	1
can	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
dispensation.	1
'T	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
called	1
upon,	1
nay,	1
constrained	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
obligations	1
that	1
form	1
the	1
bands	1
of	1
society,	1
to	1
discharge	1
sincerely	1
and	1
honestly.	1
No	1
partial	1
motive,	1
no	1
particular	1
interest,	1
no	1
pride	1
of	1
opinion,	1
no	1
temporary	1
passion	1
or	1
prejudice,	1
will	1
justify	1
to	1
himself,	1
to	1
his	1
country,	1
or	1
to	1
his	1
posterity,	1
an	1
improper	1
election	1
of	1
the	1
part	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
act.	1
Let	1
him	1
beware	1
of	1
an	1
obstinate	1
adherence	1
to	1
party;	1
let	1
him	1
reflect	1
that	1
the	1
object	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
decide	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
particular	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
community,	1
but	1
the	1
very	1
existence	1
of	1
the	1
nation;	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
remember	1
that	1
a	1
majority	1
of	1
America	1
has	1
already	1
given	1
its	1
sanction	1
to	1
the	1
plan	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
approve	1
or	1
reject.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
dissemble	1
that	1
I	1
feel	1
an	1
entire	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
arguments	1
which	1
recommend	1
the	1
proposed	1
system	1
to	1
your	1
adoption,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
unable	1
to	1
discern	1
any	1
real	1
force	1
in	1
those	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
opposed.	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
which	1
our	1
political	1
situation,	1
habits,	1
and	1
opinions	1
will	1
admit,	1
and	1
superior	1
to	1
any	1
the	1
revolution	1
has	1
produced.	1
Concessions	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
friends	1
of	1
the	1
plan,	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
a	1
claim	1
to	1
absolute	1
perfection,	1
have	1
afforded	1
matter	1
of	1
no	1
small	1
triumph	1
to	1
its	1
enemies.	1
"Why,"	1
say	1
they,	1
"should	1
we	1
adopt	1
an	1
imperfect	1
thing?	1
Why	1
not	1
amend	1
it	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
perfect	1
before	1
it	1
is	1
irrevocably	1
established?"	1
This	1
may	1
be	1
plausible	1
enough,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
plausible.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
I	1
remark,	1
that	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
these	1
concessions	1
has	1
been	1
greatly	1
exaggerated.	1
They	1
have	1
been	1
stated	1
as	1
amounting	1
to	1
an	1
admission	1
that	1
the	1
plan	1
is	1
radically	1
defective,	1
and	1
that	1
without	1
material	1
alterations	1
the	1
rights	1
and	1
the	1
interests	1
of	1
the	1
community	1
cannot	1
be	1
safely	1
confided	1
to	1
it.	1
This,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
understood	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
make	1
the	1
concessions,	1
is	1
an	1
entire	1
perversion	1
of	1
their	1
sense.	1
No	1
advocate	1
of	1
the	1
measure	1
can	1
be	1
found,	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
declare	1
as	1
his	1
sentiment,	1
that	1
the	1
system,	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
perfect	1
in	1
every	1
part,	1
is,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
a	1
good	1
one;	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
the	1
present	1
views	1
and	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
will	1
permit;	1
and	1
is	1
such	1
an	1
one	1
as	1
promises	1
every	1
species	1
of	1
security	1
which	1
a	1
reasonable	1
people	1
can	1
desire.	1
I	1
answer	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
place,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
esteem	1
it	1
the	1
extreme	1
of	1
imprudence	1
to	1
prolong	1
the	1
precarious	1
state	1
of	1
our	1
national	1
affairs,	1
and	1
to	1
expose	1
the	1
Union	1
to	1
the	1
jeopardy	1
of	1
successive	1
experiments,	1
in	1
the	1
chimerical	1
pursuit	1
of	1
a	1
perfect	1
plan.	1
I	1
never	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
perfect	1
work	1
from	1
imperfect	1
man.	1
The	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
deliberations	1
of	1
all	1
collective	1
bodies	1
must	1
necessarily	1
be	1
a	1
compound,	1
as	1
well	1
of	1
the	1
errors	1
and	1
prejudices,	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
sense	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
of	1
the	1
individuals	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
are	1
composed.	1
The	1
compacts	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
embrace	1
thirteen	1
distinct	1
States	1
in	1
a	1
common	1
bond	1
of	1
amity	1
and	1
union,	1
must	1
as	1
necessarily	1
be	1
a	1
compromise	1
of	1
as	1
many	1
dissimilar	1
interests	1
and	1
inclinations.	1
How	1
can	1
perfection	1
spring	1
from	1
such	1
materials?	1
The	1
reasons	1
assigned	1
in	1
an	1
excellent	1
little	1
pamphlet	1
lately	1
published	1
in	1
this	1
city,1	1
are	1
unanswerable	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
utter	1
improbability	1
of	1
assembling	1
a	1
new	1
convention,	1
under	1
circumstances	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
so	1
favorable	1
to	1
a	1
happy	1
issue,	1
as	1
those	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
late	1
convention	1
met,	1
deliberated,	1
and	1
concluded.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
repeat	1
the	1
arguments	1
there	1
used,	1
as	1
I	1
presume	1
the	1
production	1
itself	1
has	1
had	1
an	1
extensive	1
circulation.	1
It	1
is	1
certainly	1
well	1
worthy	1
the	1
perusal	1
of	1
every	1
friend	1
to	1
his	1
country.	1
There	1
is,	1
however,	1
one	1
point	1
of	1
light	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
amendments	1
still	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
considered,	1
and	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
exhibited	1
to	1
public	1
view.	1
I	1
cannot	1
resolve	1
to	1
conclude	1
without	1
first	1
taking	1
a	1
survey	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
aspect.	1
It	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
susceptible	1
of	1
absolute	1
demonstration,	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
far	1
more	1
easy	1
to	1
obtain	1
subsequent	1
than	1
previous	1
amendments	1
to	1
the	1
Constitution.	1
The	1
moment	1
an	1
alteration	1
is	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
plan,	1
it	1
becomes,	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
adoption,	1
a	1
new	1
one,	1
and	1
must	1
undergo	1
a	1
new	1
decision	1
of	1
each	1
State.	1
To	1
its	1
complete	1
establishment	1
throughout	1
the	1
Union,	1
it	1
will	1
therefore	1
require	1
the	1
concurrence	1
of	1
thirteen	1
States.	1
If,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
the	1
Constitution	1
proposed	1
should	1
once	1
be	1
ratified	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
States	1
as	1
it	1
stands,	1
alterations	1
in	1
it	1
may	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
be	1
effected	1
by	1
nine	1
States.	1
Here,	1
then,	1
the	1
chances	1
are	1
as	1
thirteen	1
to	1
nine2	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
subsequent	1
amendment,	1
rather	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
adoption	1
of	1
an	1
entire	1
system.	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
all.	1
Every	1
Constitution	1
for	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
must	1
inevitably	1
consist	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
variety	1
of	1
particulars,	1
in	1
which	1
thirteen	1
independent	1
States	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
accommodated	1
in	1
their	1
interests	1
or	1
opinions	1
of	1
interest.	1
We	1
may	1
of	1
course	1
expect	1
to	1
see,	1
in	1
any	1
body	1
of	1
men	1
charged	1
with	1
its	1
original	1
formation,	1
very	1
different	1
combinations	1
of	1
the	1
parts	1
upon	1
different	1
points.	1
Many	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
form	1
a	1
majority	1
on	1
one	1
question,	1
may	1
become	1
the	1
minority	1
on	1
a	1
second,	1
and	1
an	1
association	1
dissimilar	1
to	1
either	1
may	1
constitute	1
the	1
majority	1
on	1
a	1
third.	1
Hence	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
moulding	1
and	1
arranging	1
all	1
the	1
particulars	1
which	1
are	1
to	1
compose	1
the	1
whole,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
satisfy	1
all	1
the	1
parties	1
to	1
the	1
compact;	1
and	1
hence,	1
also,	1
an	1
immense	1
multiplication	1
of	1
difficulties	1
and	1
casualties	1
in	1
obtaining	1
the	1
collective	1
assent	1
to	1
a	1
final	1
act.	1
The	1
degree	1
of	1
that	1
multiplication	1
must	1
evidently	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
ratio	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
particulars	1
and	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
parties.	1
But	1
every	1
amendment	1
to	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
if	1
once	1
established,	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
single	1
proposition,	1
and	1
might	1
be	1
brought	1
forward	1
singly.	1
There	1
would	1
then	1
be	1
no	1
necessity	1
for	1
management	1
or	1
compromise,	1
in	1
relation	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
point	1
no	1
giving	1
nor	1
taking.	1
The	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
requisite	1
number	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
bring	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
a	1
decisive	1
issue.	1
And	1
consequently,	1
whenever	1
nine,	1
or	1
rather	1
ten	1
States,	1
were	1
united	1
in	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
a	1
particular	1
amendment,	1
that	1
amendment	1
must	1
infallibly	1
take	1
place.	1
There	1
can,	1
therefore,	1
be	1
no	1
comparison	1
between	1
the	1
facility	1
of	1
affecting	1
an	1
amendment,	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
establishing	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
instance	1
a	1
complete	1
Constitution.	1
In	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
subsequent	1
amendments,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
urged	1
that	1
the	1
persons	1
delegated	1
to	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
government	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
disinclined	1
to	1
yield	1
up	1
any	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
once	1
possessed.	1
For	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
I	1
acknowledge	1
a	1
thorough	1
conviction	1
that	1
any	1
amendments	1
which	1
may,	1
upon	1
mature	1
consideration,	1
be	1
thought	1
useful,	1
will	1
be	1
applicable	1
to	1
the	1
organization	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
mass	1
of	1
its	1
powers;	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
account	1
alone,	1
I	1
think	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
weight	1
in	1
the	1
observation	1
just	1
stated.	1
I	1
also	1
think	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
weight	1
in	1
it	1
on	1
another	1
account.	1
The	1
intrinsic	1
difficulty	1
of	1
governing	1
thirteen	1
States	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
independent	1
of	1
calculations	1
upon	1
an	1
ordinary	1
degree	1
of	1
public	1
spirit	1
and	1
integrity,	1
will,	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
constantly	1
impose	1
on	1
the	1
national	1
rulers	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
a	1
spirit	1
of	1
accommodation	1
to	1
the	1
reasonable	1
expectations	1
of	1
their	1
constituents.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
yet	1
a	1
further	1
consideration,	1
which	1
proves	1
beyond	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
a	1
doubt,	1
that	1
the	1
observation	1
is	1
futile.	1
It	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
the	1
national	1
rulers,	1
whenever	1
nine	1
States	1
concur,	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
option	1
upon	1
the	1
subject.	1
By	1
the	1
fifth	1
article	1
of	1
the	1
plan,	1
the	1
Congress	1
will	1
be	1
obliged	1
"on	1
the	1
application	1
of	1
the	1
legislatures	1
of	1
two	1
thirds	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
which	1
at	1
present	1
amount	1
to	1
nine,	1
to	1
call	1
a	1
convention	1
for	1
proposing	1
amendments,	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
valid,	1
to	1
all	1
intents	1
and	1
purposes,	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
when	1
ratified	1
by	1
the	1
legislatures	1
of	1
three	1
fourths	1
of	1
the	1
States,	1
or	1
by	1
conventions	1
in	1
three	1
fourths	1
thereof."	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
article	1
are	1
peremptory.	1
The	1
Congress	1
"shall	1
call	1
a	1
convention."	1
Nothing	1
in	1
this	1
particular	1
is	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
that	1
body.	1
And	1
of	1
consequence,	1
all	1
the	1
declamation	1
about	1
the	1
disinclination	1
to	1
a	1
change	1
vanishes	1
in	1
air.	1
Nor	1
however	1
difficult	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
unite	1
two	1
thirds	1
or	1
three	1
fourths	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures,	1
in	1
amendments	1
which	1
may	1
affect	1
local	1
interests,	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
room	1
to	1
apprehend	1
any	1
such	1
difficulty	1
in	1
a	1
union	1
on	1
points	1
which	1
are	1
merely	1
relative	1
to	1
the	1
general	1
liberty	1
or	1
security	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
We	1
may	1
safely	1
rely	1
on	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
the	1
State	1
legislatures	1
to	1
erect	1
barriers	1
against	1
the	1
encroachments	1
of	1
the	1
national	1
authority.	1
If	1
the	1
foregoing	1
argument	1
is	1
a	1
fallacy,	1
certain	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
myself	1
deceived	1
by	1
it,	1
for	1
it	1
is,	1
in	1
my	1
conception,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
rare	1
instances	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
political	1
truth	1
can	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
test	1
of	1
a	1
mathematical	1
demonstration.	1
Those	1
who	1
see	1
the	1
matter	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
light	1
with	1
me,	1
however	1
zealous	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
for	1
amendments,	1
must	1
agree	1
in	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
a	1
previous	1
adoption,	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
direct	1
road	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
object.	1
The	1
zeal	1
for	1
attempts	1
to	1
amend,	1
prior	1
to	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
the	1
Constitution,	1
must	1
abate	1
in	1
every	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
accede	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
observations	1
of	1
a	1
writer	1
equally	1
solid	1
and	1
ingenious:	1
"To	1
balance	1
a	1
large	1
state	1
or	1
society	1
Usays	1
hee,	1
whether	1
monarchical	1
or	1
republican,	1
on	1
general	1
laws,	1
is	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
so	1
great	1
difficulty,	1
that	1
no	1
human	1
genius,	1
however	1
comprehensive,	1
is	1
able,	1
by	1
the	1
mere	1
dint	1
of	1
reason	1
and	1
reflection,	1
to	1
effect	1
it.	1
The	1
judgments	1
of	1
many	1
must	1
unite	1
in	1
the	1
work;	1
experience	1
must	1
guide	1
their	1
labor;	1
time	1
must	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
perfection,	1
and	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
inconveniences	1
must	1
correct	1
the	1
mistakes	1
which	1
they	1
INEVITABLY	1
fall	1
into	1
in	1
their	1
first	1
trials	1
and	1
experiments."3	1
These	1
judicious	1
reflections	1
contain	1
a	1
lesson	1
of	1
moderation	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
sincere	1
lovers	1
of	1
the	1
Union,	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
upon	1
their	1
guard	1
against	1
hazarding	1
anarchy,	1
civil	1
war,	1
a	1
perpetual	1
alienation	1
of	1
the	1
States	1
from	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
military	1
despotism	1
of	1
a	1
victorious	1
demagogue,	1
in	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
obtain,	1
but	1
from	1
time	1
and	1
experience.	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
me	1
a	1
defect	1
of	1
political	1
fortitude,	1
but	1
I	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
entertain	1
an	1
equal	1
tranquillity	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
affect	1
to	1
treat	1
the	1
dangers	1
of	1
a	1
longer	1
continuance	1
in	1
our	1
present	1
situation	1
as	1
imaginary.	1
A	1
nation,	1
without	1
a	1
national	1
government,	1
is,	1
in	1
my	1
view,	1
an	1
awful	1
spectacle.	1
The	1
establishment	1
of	1
a	1
Constitution,	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
profound	1
peace,	1
by	1
the	1
voluntary	1
consent	1
of	1
a	1
whole	1
people,	1
is	1
a	1
prodigy,	1
to	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
look	1
forward	1
with	1
trembling	1
anxiety.	1
I	1
can	1
reconcile	1
it	1
to	1
no	1
rules	1
of	1
prudence	1
to	1
let	1
go	1
the	1
hold	1
we	1
now	1
have,	1
in	1
so	1
arduous	1
an	1
enterprise,	1
upon	1
seven	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
thirteen	1
States,	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
passed	1
over	1
so	1
considerable	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
ground,	1
to	1
recommence	1
the	1
course.	1
I	1
dread	1
the	1
more	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
new	1
attempts,	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
powerful	1
individuals,	1
in	1
this	1
and	1
in	1
other	1
States,	1
are	1
enemies	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
national	1
government	1
in	1
every	1
possible	1
shape.	1
